EU Statement on the killing of HRD Lesbia Yaneth Urquía Urquía in Honduras
12 July 2016
On 9 July 2016, the European Union External Service published the following statement: The murder of Lesbia Yaneth Urquía Urquía adds to the dire list of Human Rights Defenders that were recently murdered in Honduras, including journalist Henry Roberto Reyes Salazar, environmentalist and indigenous leaders Berta Cáceres and Nelson García, and leader of LGBTI community René Martinez.
	This killing as well as the climate of violence that continues to prevail over human rights activists in the country is an extremely worrying development. More urgent and decisive steps should be taken swiftly by the authorities to protect Human Rights Defenders in the country and fight impunity. This includes the need for impartial investigations leading to prosecution and indictment of those responsible for these acts, as well as effective protection of other potential victims. The recent visit to Honduras of EU Special Representative for Human Rights Stavros Lambrinidis reconfirmed our strong commitment to human rights in Honduras.
