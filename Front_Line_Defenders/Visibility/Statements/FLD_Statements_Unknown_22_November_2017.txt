Front Line Defenders welcomes adoption of landmark UN resolution
22 November 2017
Front Line Defenders welcomes the adoption of the UN Anniversary Resolution on Protection of Human Rights Defenders. Facilitated by Norway ahead of the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, the resolution reaffirms the international community's shared commitment to protecting those who struggle peacefully for rights and justice. In October, Front Line Defenders hosted Geir Sjoberg of the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Policy at the Dublin Platform for Human Rights Defenders to discuss the proposed resolution.  "This year’s resolution will ask ... how the UN system more effectively can address your situation,” he announced to more than 100 at-risk activists. "The UN has to do more." The resolution is a milestone for human rights defenders who put their lives on the line to protect their communities. “Authoritarians and repressive regimes around the world fear the peaceful, powerful work of human rights defenders struggling for change in their countries," said Front Line Defenders’ Executive Director Andrew Anderson. "The Norwegian resolution serves as a reminder that the protection of HRDs is critical to realizing human rights for all, and that those who persecute, attack, and imprison peaceful activists must be held to account." The Anniversary Resolution on Protection of Human Rights Defenders was adopted on 21 November 2017, with united support of the UN Member States.
