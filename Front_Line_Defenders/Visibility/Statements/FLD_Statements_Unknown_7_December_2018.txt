It affirms the rights of all people to work, asylum, nationality, and a fair trail; to freedoms including movement, assembly, association, opinion and expression; and to live free from slavery, torture, arbitrary arrest and discrimination. In the 70 years since the UDHR was established, grassroots human rights defenders around the world have succeeded in realizing many of these rights for their communities despite the violent, often lethal risks they face in their struggles. In recognition of the need to protect activists leading human rights movements around the globe, the UN adopted the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders in 1998, the 50th anniversary of the UDHR. In the 20 years since the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders was adopted, HRDâ€™s have received global recognition for their critical work on issues ranging from LGBT rights to land and environmental protection. At the same time, Front Line Defenders has documented consistent and targeted attacks against HRDs in almost every country in the world. Erin Kilbride
