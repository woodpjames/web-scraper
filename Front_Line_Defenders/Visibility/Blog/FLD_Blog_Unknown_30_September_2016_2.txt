Remembering Max de Mesa
30 September 2016
 Front Line Defenders is extremely saddened and would like to express its deep condolences for the sudden death of renowned human rights defender from the Philippines, Mr. Max de Mesa, on 28 September 2016. Max de Mesa was serving as the the Chairperson of Philippine Alliance of Human Rights Advocates (PAHRA) and Executive Committee member and Treasurer of FORUM-ASIA.  He worked with many other human rights organisations, initiatives, networks over the decades. The loss of a dedicated human rights defender like him is irreparable and the human rights movement would certainly miss his dedication.  We want to express our heartfelt condolences to his family and loved ones. May his soul rest in peace. May his life and human rights work continue to guide the human rights movement.
