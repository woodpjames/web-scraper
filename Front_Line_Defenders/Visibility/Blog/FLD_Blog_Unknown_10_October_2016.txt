In solidarity with HRDs from the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe
10 October 2016
Today is a national holiday in the United States. Schools, banks, and government buildings are all closed to commemorate the arrival of Christopher Columbus to a land he thought was India. In fact, 1492 marked the year Columbus "discovered" a land already home to almost 20 million indigenous peoples. Since that day, indigenous communities of the continent have suffered centuries of persecution, massacre, disease, and systemic violations of their rights to land. Today, on "Columbus Day," indigenous struggles continue in the United States as human rights defenders from the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe fight alongside other indigenous tribes to defend their land from the destructive Dakota Access Pipeline project. Front Line Defenders recently conducted a mission to interview and stand in solidarity with HRDs from the Standing Rock Sioux tribe. Meet Ladonna Bravebull Allard, a WHRD and a member of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. Ladonna Bravebull Allard has been an outspoken opponent of the Dakota Access Pipeline project, peacefully demanding recognition of her people's rights to their indigenous territory and resources.
