CEJIL promotes dialogue on the implementation of decisions made within the Inter-American System
 23/11/2014 
San José , November 20, 2014- From Monday November 24 to Tuesday November 25, 2014, the Center for Justice and International Law (CEJIL) will hold a seminar on the implementation of decisions made by mechanisms within the Inter-American System and the administration of justice: synergies , tensions and possibilities in San Jose, Costa Rica. The event aims to create a space for reflection between different stakeholders vested in implementing the decisions made by the Commission and Inter-American Court on Human Rights (I-A Court), particularly measures related to obtaining justice. While states in the region have repeatedly expressed their appreciation for  decisions made by the Inter-American System, many challenges remain for achieving consistent compliance with all resolutions. The meeting in San José will gather leading academics, jurists, human rights defenders, and members of the Commission and the I-A Court. The conference will start on Monday 24 morning and the first plenary session will be available to the public via streaming via this link. You can also check the event schedule here.
