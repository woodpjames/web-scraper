Inter-American Court of Human Rights condemns Venezuela for the execution of two brothers in 1996
 15/10/2014 
The Inter-American Court of Human Rights announced its ruling in the Landaeta Brothers v. Venezuela case which found the State responsible for the extrajudicial executions of Igmar Alexander and his younger brother Eduardo José Landaeta at the hands of security forces from the state of Aragua, Venezuela in November and December 1996, respectively. The case was litigated by the Center for Justice and International Law (CEJIL ), the Comisión de Derechos Humanos de Justicia y Paz del Estado Aragua (Comisión de Justicia y Paz de Aragua), the Vicaría Episcopal de Derechos Humanos de Caracas, and other organizations representing the Landaeta family before the Inter-American System. “Resulting from the disproportionate use of force by police officers in the state of Aragua, the murders of the Landaeta brothers highlight the serious problems that have been taking place in Venezuela for over two decades,” said Viviana Krsticevic, Executive Director of CEJIL, “This sentence underscores the need to strengthen public policies that call for greater accountability from police officers and fight against impunity. Seeking justice for the Landaeta brothers means seeking justice for all the families who have been victimized by these practices.” The case of the Landaeta Brothers is one of many cases litigated by CEJIL in front of the Inter-American Court with the collaboration of partner organizations involving extrajudicial executions and the disproportionate use of force in Venezuela. Some of these cases include: El Amparo (1995), El Caracazo (1999), Blanco Romero y otros (desaparecidos de Vargas) (2005), Retén de Catia (Montero Aranguren) (2006) and more recent cases highlighting current security challenges, including: Familia Barrios (2011) y Uzcátegui (2012).
