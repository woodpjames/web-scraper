 02/10/2014 
San José, 7 de octubre de 2014.- In light of the violent events which took place on September 26 and 27 in Mexico’s state of Guerrero, the Center for Justice and International Law (CEJIL) asks that the safety of the missing students as well as the safety of their families and advocates is guaranteed by Mexican authorities throughout the investigation process. Specifically, we ask for the protection of members of the Center for Human Rights of Tlachinollan Mountain. According to reports provided to CEJIL, policemen clashed with students’ en-route from Iguala to the state capital of Chilpancingo after completing a fundraiser for their school. Over the course of the next few days, violence escalated when unidentified gunmen opened fire on the students, killing three people and injuring six. Forty-three students were taken away in police vehicles and to date, were still missing. Then, on October 4th, reports announced that Mexican law enforcement agents discovered 5 mass graves containing the remains of several students. CEJIL urges authorities to correctly identify the bodies, to continue their search for the remaining students who are still missing, and to bring to justice those who committed this heinous atrocity. We ask the authorities to maintain constant contact with the families of the missing students to guarantee their right to access information and participation throughout the course of the investigation. The state must guarantee their rights to truth, justice, and redress.
