CEJIL and CLADE present Summaries of Jurisprudence: Right to Education
 23/02/2015 
Sao Paolo, Buenos Aires, February 23th 2015. - CEJIL and the Latin-American Campaign for the Right to Education (CLADE) will present Summaries Jurisprudence: Right to education at the Fifth Assembly of the Global Campaign for Education in the South African capital of Johannesburg, where more than 200 people working for the right to education across 100 countries will meet. How do different regional and international human rights organizations interpret the different dimensions of the human right to education? In their new publication, CEJIL and CLADE attempt to answer this question by identifying and charting the major decisions made by regional human rights mechanisms on the right to education. The result can be found in Right to Education, a new volume of CEJIL’s Tools for the Protection of Human Rights: Summaries of Jurisprudence. This publication includes judgments made by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, European Court of Human Rights, the African Committee of Experts on the Rights and Welfare of the Child and the Committee on Human Rights of the UN. These judgements have taken place in these courts from 1988 to 2014 and deal with the fulfillment of the right to education for various groups, such as people with disabilities, migrants, persons deprived of liberty and indigenous peoples. The broad scope of decisions which the Summary presents will serve as a tool to analyze the criteria stemming from these rulings. "We hope disseminate and make available the standards that have been produced by major international human rights bodies to strengthen the defense and protection of education among those working on such an important issue," write Viviana Krsticevic, Executive Director of CEJIL and Camilla Croso Coordinator General CLADE in the presentation’s foreword. The Summaries of Jurisprudence series has been published since 2010 (previous editions here).This recent publication is available for download via the websites of the institutions, in Spanish and English: CEJIL www.cejil.org CLADE www.campanaderechoeducacion.org
