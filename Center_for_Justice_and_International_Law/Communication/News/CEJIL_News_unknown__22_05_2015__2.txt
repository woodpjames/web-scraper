CEJIL and its allies achieve precautionary measures for defenders of displaced people in Sinaloa
 22/05/2015 
The IACHR adopted precautionary measures for E and K, and their families upon determining that they are in a situation of risk due to their activities as human rights defenders of populations displaced by organized crime in the region of Sierra Madre in Sinaloa, Mexico. The request for the measures was presented by the Mexican Commission for the Defense and Protection of Human Rights, Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC), the International Human rights Clinic, Loyola Law School (LA) and CEJIL. The organizations demonstrated before the IACHR that the beneficiaries would be at risk given their activities as defenders. Taking opportunity of the moment, CEJIL urged the Mexican state to respect and protect the rights of human rights defenders, allowing them to carry out their work without being the objects of hostility and violence. As such, they made a call to the State to keep with their obligation to investigate threats against the beneficiaries and to protect the victims of internal displacement.
