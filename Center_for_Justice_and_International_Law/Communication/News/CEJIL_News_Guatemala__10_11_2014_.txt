 10/11/2014 
10 November 2014 – International and regional organizations call for Guatemala to respect judicial independence and reject the illegal sanction of Judge Yassmin Barrios. Guatemala’s constitutional court is now considering a challenge concerning the authority of the country’s lawyers’ association to sanction Judge Barrios for her actions as a presiding judge during the 2013 trial of former dictator Efraín Ríos Montt and his then head of intelligence Mauricio Rodriguez Sanchez. Nine international organizations and organizations from Latin America – Open Society Justice Initiative (OSJI), Center for Justice and International Law (CEJIL), the Due Process of Law Foundation (DPLF), the International Federation of Human Rights (FIDH), Center for Legal and Social Studies (Centro de Estudios Legales y Sociales – CELS), the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights, the Guatemala Human Rights Commission (GHRC), International Platform Against Impunity in Guatemala (Plataforma Holondesa contra la Impunidad en Guatemala), and the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA) – call on Guatemala to reverse this sanction, and guarantee protections for the independence and impartiality of the Guatemalan judiciary.
