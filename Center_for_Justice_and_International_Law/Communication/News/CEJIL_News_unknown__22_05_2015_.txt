Sanctions against Judge Yassmín Barrios annulled
 22/05/2015 
The Constitutional Court of Guatemala (CC) annulled sanctions previously issued against Judge Yassmín Barrios for an alleged “lack of ethics” when carrying out her duties.  The charge stemmed from her alleged “public humiliation” of one of the defense attorneys for ex-military members Efraín Rios Montt and Rodriguez Sanchez during the historic trial for the genocide against the Ixil people. On March 10th, the country’s high tribunal published a decision, cancelling the pending sanctions against the Judge, as dictated by the Tribunal of Honor of the School of Lawyers and Notary’s of Guatemala (CANG) and by the Assembly of Presidents of Professional Schools (APCP) Last December, CEJIL presented an amicus curiae before the CC, noting that the said decisions were violations of judicial independence and the related international standards on the subject matter. “"The decision made by Guatemala’s highest court protects the rights of Judge Barrios and establishes an important precedent to help avoid undue interference with judicial independence," said Marcia Aguiluz, CEJIL’s Program Director for Central America and Mexico, "However, Guatemala is facing major challenges to protect the independence of the judiciary. We are concerned transfers to remote locations and preventive supervisions recently ordered by the Supreme Court will be to the detriment of judges". In its ruling, the CC limited the union tribunal’s possibility to receive complaints about ethical breaches that are regulated by ordinary code of conduct of judges. The CC also stressed that it could not analyze the legality of judicial decisions.
