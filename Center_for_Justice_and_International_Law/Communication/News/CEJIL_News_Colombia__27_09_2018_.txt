Join us for a Tweet-a-Thon to #DefendtheDefenders in Colombia
 27/09/2018 
Colombia is one of the most dangerous countries in the world for human rights defenders. Since the signing of the Peace Agreement in 2016, at least 342 social activists—most of them Afro-descendent and indigenous leaders—have been killed. This year alone, the number of murders stands at over 120. 

These deaths have sent shockwaves across Colombia and the Americas, prompting the creation of the documentary “They're Killing Us,” which features two social leaders from Colombia´s Cauca region. Their story will be featured during a documentary tour screening in the United States throughout the coming weeks. Join the Twitterstorm We will raise our voices in solidarity and demand that the State of Colombia #DefendtheDefenders on Twitter from 5 to 7 p.m. EST. Join us in calling for safety guarantees for social leaders so they may carry out their crucial work safely and free from harm. Peace must be extended to all inhabitants of the country, but in particular to all those people who are playing a fundamental role in building a new Colombia. Mensajes sugeridos.
