The IACHR prioritizes the case of Beatriz in El Salvador 
 22/05/2015 
The Inter-American Commission of Human Rights (IACHR) ordered El Salvador to provide a report on the case of Beatriz by June 24th. Through this expedited process, the Commission prioritized her case, shortening processing time by three years, and took into consideration the severe impact on womenâ€™s rights that occurs when a State penalizes all forms of abortion. The lawsuit against El Salvador is based on the human rights violations experienced by Beatriz, a young Salvadorian woman who became pregnant at the end of 2012 while suffering from a severe chronic illness. The doctors recommended she undergo a therapeutic abortion due to the risk posed to her own health and survival as well as congenital anomalies displayed by her fetus that would have likely prevented the pregnancy from coming to term. Nevertheless, public health system doctors did not interrupt the pregnancy due to fears of possible prosecution. Only as a result of the protection of the measures issued by the Inter-American Commission and Court of Human Rights, was a Caesarean section performed during the 26th week pregnancy.
