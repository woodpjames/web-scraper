New law for the protection of defenders passes in Honduras
 22/05/2015 
On April 15, Honduras passed the Law of Protection of Human Rights Defenders, Journalists, Social Communicators, and Judicial Officials. This occurred in response to the recommendations made by numerous international human rights bodies to the Honduran government and takes into account many of the proposals made by human rights organizations. The legislation is important because it recognizes the right of all people, individually or collectively, to advocate and administer the promotion, protection and attainment of human rights and fundamental freedoms and is committed to the protection to exercise that right. It also creates a National Protection System and a Council consisting of various state institutions with the participation of representatives of the target groups. The legislation lays out with greater clarity the roles of each component of the System, establishes a procedure for accessing protection in case of risk and provides resources through a fund from the security fee to ensure the implementation of the law. At the same time, it recognizes the binding nature of protection measures issued by the Inter-American Commission and Court of Human Rights and the obligation to implement them properly. However, the success of this new legislation will depend on its implementation. It is essential that the Honduran government continue the dialog with civil society organizations, human rights defenders and other relevant actors in order to achieve the goal for which the law was created.
