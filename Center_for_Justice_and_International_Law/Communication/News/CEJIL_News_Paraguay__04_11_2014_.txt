Washington D.C., October 31, 2014. – Cases of violence against peasants in Uruguay were presented at a hearing before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, where the Center for Justice and International Law (CEJIL) addressed the distinct expressions of this violence, which affects the right to life, personal integrity and access to justice on behalf of peasants, as a result of their fight for access and tenancy of land in Paraguay. Martina González Paredes testified directly to the fact that at least 110 cases of executions and disappearances of leaders and members of pro-peasant organizations have taken place between February 3,, 1989 and August 15, 2013. Of the 91 open cases, only 8 cases have advanced to partial convictions, without the clarification of facts or punishment for those responsible for the alleged crimes. After thanking Martina for her testimony, James L. Cavallaro, Rapporteur of Persons Deprived of Right to Liberty asked the representatives of the State of Paraguay if they could not investigate the 115 unpunished murders,  and commented “it is important to put a face to the facts.” On his part, the Rapporteur for Social and Economic Rights, Paulo Vannuchi, has underlined that in the circumstances that peasants live in, “many times the fight for land represents the fight for food for their children.” The lack of adequate and diligent investigation by the State, in order to identify and convict those responsible of these violations of human rights, was also denounced during the hearing. The hearing was part of the joint work of civil society organizations and peasant groups in Paraguay, denouncing the violence and impunity for violations of human rights in the country.
