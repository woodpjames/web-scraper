International Organizations Call for Transparency and Accountability in the Selection of  Supreme Court Justices in Honduras 
 15/01/2016 
San José,  11 de enero de 2016.- The International Observatory on judicial selection in Honduras calls upon the Nominating Board [Junta Nominadora] and the Congress of the Republic to guarantee transparency and accountability in the final phase of the selection process for the country’s Supreme Court Justices.

The international organizations monitoring this process expressed their concerns in a written document  which noted several  irregularites observed during the elections' first cycle, including the fact that the Nominating Board (Junta Nominadora) did not publicly disclose its methodology of candidate assesment or why certain candidates moved forward while others didn't. Additionally, the document mentions concerns over the confidencial nature of available positions, despite the Inter-American Commission on Human Right's recommendations to make information about their vacancy open to the public in order to generate greater participation from citizens. Finally, the organizations noted that the list of preselected individuals included tthree current Supreme Court justices that  acted questionably by participating in the arbitrary dismissal of three other judges and a justice immediately following the June 28, 2009 coup d’état . In view of the above, and considering the international principles, rules, and standards applicable to this process, the member organizations of the International Observatory issued recommendations compiled in the aformentioned document.
