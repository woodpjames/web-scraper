2021 14th St NW, Washington, DC, 20009 This documentary follows two social leaders, indigenous and Afro-descendent, fighting for their communities’ rights while navigating the deadly side of Colombia’s peace process: 342 assassinations of human rights leaders since January 2016. While the world focuses on the demobilization of the FARC rebel group, this documentary focuses on the separate war being waged on the social leaders and human rights defenders in Colombia’s ethnic communities. Join filmmakers Tom Laffay, Emily Wright and Daniel Bustos, social leader featured in the film Héctor Marino, Soraya Gutiérrez of CAJAR and Marco Romero of CODHES for an in-depth Q&A and discussion on the making of this film and the current political climate in Colombia’s Cauca department.
