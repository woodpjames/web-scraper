 04/06/2015 
The undersigned human rights organizations welcome the announcement that United Nations Secretary General Ban-Ki Moon has approved the mandate renewal of the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) until September 2017, in response to a formal request from Guatemalan President Otto Pérez Molina. In particular, the groups below applaud the Secretary General and the State of Guatemala for maintaining the mandate in its current form as provided for in the 2006 agreement between them, thereby granting CICIG full authority and independence to carry out its essential work. The Secretary General is also to be commended for facilitating the approval of the Guatemalan President’s request without delay, thus ensuring the continuity and security of CICIG’s operations at a critical moment.
