Civil Society groups urge prompt, independent investigation to bring perpetrators of Marielle Franco´s death to justice
 20/03/2018 
During the 37th Regular Session of the Human Rights Council, CEJIL, along with other civil society groups, condemned the murder of Brazilian human rights defender Marielle Franco and Anderson Gomes; and urged Brazilian authorities to ensure a prompt, impartial and independent investigation to bring the perpetrators to justice . Human rights defenders are facing unprecedented violence and stigmatization as Brazil ranks at the top in defender’s deaths. In this dangerous environment, Civil Society protection is key to the implementation of the Vienna Declaration on Human Rights. Prior to her killing, Marielle was appointed as a parliamentary rapporteur to monitor the military intervention in Rio de Janeiro and was outspoken on the violence that often accompanied the armed forces in Rio de Janeiro. Marielle’s strength and engagement will serve as a source of inspiration for the work on the protection on human rights. You can read the full letter presented to the Human Rights Council here.
