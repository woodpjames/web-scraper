CEJIL calls on U.S. to implement human rights standards through immigration reform in public IACHR hearing
 28/10/2013 
Washington, DC, October 28, 2013.- This afternoon, the Center for Justice and International Law (CEJIL) joined a coalition of immigration attorneys, NGOs, law clinics, labor unions, and members of directly-affected immigrant communities to call on the United States to fulfill its international obligations through comprehensive immigration reform in a public hearing before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR, Commission).CEJIL requested that the Inter-American Commission include its comprehensive studies in its annual report and create a thematic report, hold an on-site visit to monitor U.S. detention and deportation policies, and monitor legislative and administrative developments’ impact on the rights of migrants through a transversal human rights approach taking into account the rights of migrant families, children, women, workers, and LGBTI migrants.In 2010, CEJIL won a favorable judgment from the Commission in the case of Wayne Smith and Hugo Armendariz, which required the U.S. to reform its laws to allow consideration of family and community ties in deportation proceedings. Similarly, the IACHR issued a number of detailed recommendations on immigration detention and due process in 2010. The United States still has not complied with these recommendations.“The United States government’s failure to comply with its outstanding human rights obligations currently results in widespread violations of the rights of migrant families, children, and communities. The United States must seize this historic opportunity and finally comply with international human rights standards through comprehensive immigration reform,” said Francisco Quintana, Program Director for the Andean, North America and Caribbean Region, of CEJIL. “But there are a number of administrative measures the United States can – and must – take immediately to better guarantee the human rights of migrant families and children, including incorporating human rights standards into its administrative guidelines for decision-makers in immigration proceedings, as we’ve outlined in our reports.”At the hearing, CEJIL was joined by a broad-based coalition of representatives from the AFL-CIO, Gibbs Houston Pauw, Stanford Immigration Rights Clinic, Boston College Post-Deportation Human Rights Project, the National Day Labor Organizing Network (NDLON), Immigration Equality, Advocates for Human Rights, the New Orleans Workers’ Center for Racial Justice, and the Boston University Law Clinic, as well as supporters from faith-based immigrant rights coalitions.
