 23/09/2014 
Rio de Janeiro, Thursday September 11, 2014. Last Wednesday the Federal Regional Court of the Second Circuit unanimously denied the habeas corpus request that was filed by the four soldiers accused of murdering and hiding the body of Ex-Congressman Rubens Paiva in 1971.This decision allows the prosecution to continue its regular course in the first instance of the federal justice system. Likewise, with this decision, the tribunal guarantees that judicial truth can be obtained in the recognition of the grave violations of human rights committed during the military dictatorship.For Beatriz Affonso, CEJIL Program Director for Brazil, this is a historic decision that demonstrates the judicial powerâ€™s commitment to act in conformity with the international commitments assumed by the Brazilian State.Read the complete press release in Portuguese.Photo Credit: Lavras 24 horas
