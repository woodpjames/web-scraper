#JusticeforLindaLoaiza at the Inter-American Court on February 6th
 05/02/2018 
When Linda Loaiza López Soto was 18 years old, she was kidnapped on the way out of her home in Caracas, Venezuela, and under threat of death, held hostage for three months. Even though she managed to escape captivity, Linda was sexually abused and severely injured, suffering from physical and psychological injuries.During the course of the investigation, Linda Loaiza was revictimized by a judicial process full of gender stereotypes, irregularities, delays and even corruption of evidence. Furthermore, Linda’s case exemplifies the situation of impunity that prevails in complaints filed by thousands of Venezuelan women, who are victims of sexual and gender abuse. This led to Linda and her representatives - the Center for Justice and International Law (CEJIL), the Comité de Familiares de las Víctimas de Febrero y Marzo de 1989 (COFAVIC) and in national instances by the lawyer Juan Bernardo Delgado- to present the case before the Inter-American Human Rights System.The Inter-American Court of Human Rights will hold a public hearing on February 6th from 08:30 a.m. to 07:00 p.m. Costa Rican time. This will be the first case of gender-based violence from Venezuela to be recognized by an international court of human rights. We invite you to stand with  Linda as she asks for justice for her case and for other women who have survived torture.
