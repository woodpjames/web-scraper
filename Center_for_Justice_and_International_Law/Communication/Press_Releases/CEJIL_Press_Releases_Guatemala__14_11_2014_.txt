IACHR orders Guatemala to take protection measures on behalf of judge Claudia Escobar
 14/11/2014 
On Wednesday, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights notified the Center of Justice and International Law (CEJIL), who is representing judge Claudia Escobar, about the measures of protection granted to her and her family based on the immediate danger they face in Guatemala.The Commission approved the measures based on two factors: the allegations made by the judge surrounding the irregularities in the electoral process and appointment of judges of the Supreme Court of Justice and the Appellate Court who correlate to high state authorities, as well as public statements made by state officials by communications media and other actors who are in opposition to Ms. Escobar.Marcia Aguiluz, Director of the CEJIL Program for Central America and Mexico, stated: “in Guatemala, the operators of justice who act with integrity and honesty find themselves at serious risk as they are victims to acts of hostility and threats on behalf of sectors interested in perpetuating impunity. The request for precautionary measures by the IACHR reflects the concern of the international body for the situation they face and is a signal to the authorities to respect the integrity and judicial independence of those who administer justice.”
