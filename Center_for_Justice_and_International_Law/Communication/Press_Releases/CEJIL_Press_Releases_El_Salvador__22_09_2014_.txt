El Salvador makes advances in the recognition of victims of forced disappearance
 22/09/2014 
CEJIL celebrated the unveiling of the plaque and the naming of the education center, ”Gregoria Herminia, Serapio Cristian y Julia Inés Contreras,” named after three siblings who were disappeared by the military on August 25, 1982, during the Salvadoran armed conflict.This important ceremony was presided over by the President of El Salvador, Sánchez Cerén, on September 11 and originated in the Hermanos Contreras et al v. El Salvador judgment that was issued by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in 2011. The case was brought before the international court by CEJIL and the Association for the Search of Disappeared Children (Asociación Pro-Búsqueda de Niños y Niñas Desaparecidos).The Inter-American Court concluded that during the armed conflict there was a systematic pattern of forced disappearances of boys and girls conducted by military authorities. Among the victims in the cited case, Gregoria and Serapio Contreras and José Rubén Rivera Rivera have been found. However, Julia Inés Contreras, Ana Julia and Carmelina Mejía Ramírez have yet to have been found.CEJIL urges the State to continue advancing in its comprehensive compliance with the judgment, which includes, among other measures, to advance with the investigation, trial and punishment of all those responsible for the disappearances and to continue searching for Julia Inés Contreras, Ana Julia and Carmelina Mejía Ramírez, as well as to guarantee access to the files that contain useful and relevant information for the investigation in cases of human rights violations that occurred during armed conflict.Press ContactDaniela Arayadaraya@cejil.org+506 22807473
