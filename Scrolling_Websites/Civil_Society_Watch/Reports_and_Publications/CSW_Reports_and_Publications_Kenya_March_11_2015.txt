Attacks on Civil Society Undermining Democracy and Development in Kenya
March 11, 2015
This Policy Action Brief, co-authored by CIVICUS and the National Coalition of Human Rights Defenders-Kenya, presents an overview of the challenging environment for civil society in Kenya, particularly since the March 2013 elections which brought the Jubilee Coalition government in power. It assesses the Jubilee Coalition’s tenure in office and notes that many analysts have mixed feelings about the government’s handling of political and economic challenges and that civil society in Kenya is deeply disturbed by official attitudes toward the non-profit sector.  The brief makes several recommendations on steps to create an enabling environment for civil society.
