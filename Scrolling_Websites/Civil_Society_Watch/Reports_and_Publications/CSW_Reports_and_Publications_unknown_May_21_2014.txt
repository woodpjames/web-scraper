Civil Society Index- Rapid Assessment (CSI-RA) - West Africa Reports
May 21, 2014
The CIVICUS Civil Society Index‐Rapid Assessment (CSI‐RA) project in West Africa was initiated in 2013 with financial support from Open Society Initiative for West Africa (OSIWA) and CIVICUS, and in partnership with the West African Civil Society Institute (WACSI). The ultimate goal of the project was to generate local knowledge by civil society and develop actionable recommendations that can promote civil society’s role and capacity to foster democracy and citizen’s participation in Benin, Ghana, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal and Sierra Leone.It engaged civil society partners in these countries in developing and implementing a self‐assessment tool that contributes to evidence‐based civil society strengthening at the country level. Because the CSI-RA offers a more flexible methodology that is designed to be highly adaptable to any context, including sub-national, sectoral or thematic contexts; the different country partners chose, in consultation with a wide range of CSOs, different areas of assessment depending on their needs and prioritization.CIVICUS is pleased to present its new Civil Society in West Africa report and the six country reports, that focus on the following subjects:SenegalStructureEnabling environmentValuesImpactSierra LeoneCivil Society Organisations as InstitutionsResource base and sustainabilityNetworking and collaborationNigeriaInternal governanceLegitimacy, Transparency and AccountabilityNetworks and CollaborationsInformation Sharing/CommunicationResourcingValuesLegal environmentImpactLiberiaInstitutional capacity and Programme CapacityFinancial and Fundraising Capacity           Civil Society Coordination and CollaborationCollaboration with GovernmentGhanaAreas of work and operationRelations and networks/coalition buildingCitizen’s participation and activismImpactBeninInternal governanceResource mobilisation and capacitiesFor more information please contact: emailProtector.addCloakedMailto("ep_61f7a39e", 1);
