This article originally appeared in Al Jazeera.Monday marked the International Day against the Use of Child Soldiers.It is a problem that shows no sign of ending, in fact, many rights groups and the UN say it is getting worse. There are tens of thousands of children around the world putting their lives at risk.And the global effort to fight this scourge does not have the money it needs.In 2015, less than one percent of the estimated $174bn of international aid was spent on this issue.But it is not all gloom and doom; there has been some progress. At least 5,000 child soldiers were released and integrated into society last year in places like the Democratic Republic of Congo.And 167 countries have now ratified the international treaty which bans the conscription of children under the age of 18.But the UN has highlighted 14 countries where the problem is still a concern including Yemen, Syria, Somalia, South Sudan and Iraq.So, what should be done to stop the recruitment of children into conflict?Published:
