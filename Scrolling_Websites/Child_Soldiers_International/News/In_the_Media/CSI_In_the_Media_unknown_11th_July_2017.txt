How to better protect children from extreme violence
11th July, 2017
In early October Isabelle Guitard, our Director of Programmes, joined a conference of international experts to discuss ways to better protect children from the threat of extreme violence.In this video interview, Isabelle and other experts in our field explain how the resilience of communities could be improved to protect children from extreme violence. We believe we must start by listening to children, their families and communities living in conflict-affected areas in order to understand their experiences. Only then can those in the children and armed conflict field work together to design interventions that rebuild a stable and protective society that helps children grow safely into adulthood.Published:
