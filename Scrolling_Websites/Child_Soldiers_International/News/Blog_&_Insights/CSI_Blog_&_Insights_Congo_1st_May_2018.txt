Jane Garvey to present our BBC Radio 4 Appeal to help Congo's girl soldiers
1st May, 2018
Jane Garvey will be presenting a charity appeal for Child Soldiers International on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday 4 February and Thursday 8 February.The celebrated broadcaster, renowned for hosting the station’s ever-popular Woman’s Hour programme, will present an appeal on Sunday 4 February at 07:54 and 21:26 and again at 15:27 on Thursday 8 February.The appeal will focus on our project in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo which is helping former girl soldiers return to education and rebuild their lives within their communities.It will put the spotlight on girls – who account for around 40% of all child soldiers in DR Congo – and explain how our work is helping them overcome the stigma and rejection they endure when they return home.We’re delighted to be launching this appeal, which we hope will raise much-needed funds to support our education projects and work with local communities - to improve the lives of many of DRC’s former girl child soldiers.Published:
