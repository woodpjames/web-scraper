A selection of stories concerning child soldiers which have appeared in international media over the past month.A landmark ruling in December saw the International Criminal Court (ICC) order former Congolese warlord Thomas Lubanga to pay $10m in reparations to hundreds of child soldiers recruited under his watch.Lubanga was jailed in 2012 for 14 years for recruiting boys and girls in the Union of Congolese Patriots (UPC) armed group in Eastern DRC during the 2000s.On 15 December, ICC judges ruled he is now liable to pay compensation to 425 victims who were all under-15 at the time of the crimes during 2002 and 2003. It is believed many more could now come forward.Child Soldiers International’s Sandra Olsson told AFP she hoped the ruling would "act as a catalyst in showing that those who recruit and exploit children in conflict will be held accountable for their crimes."Armed conflict in Somalia is leaving thousands of civilians at risk with cases of child recruitment increasing 269% from 2015 to 2017, a new United Nations report revealed in December.“Ultimately, civilians are paying the price for failure to resolve Somalia's conflicts through political means,” said the UN Secretary-General's Special Representative for Somalia, Michael Keating. “And parties to the conflict are simply not doing enough to shield civilians from the violence.

I’m not even sure those two knew about each other.”At the end of 2017, UNICEF highlighted the ‘shocking scale’ at which children in conflict zones have come under attack over the past year.“Children are being targeted and exposed to attacks and brutal violence in their homes, schools and playgrounds,” said Manuel Fontaine, UNICEF Director of Emergency Programmes. “As these attacks continue year after year, we cannot become numb. Such brutality cannot be the new normal.”Over the course of 2017:Published:
