Red Hand Day 2019!
11th February, 2019
We have been delighted to receive such a great selection of submissions from schools for Red Hand Day 2019.12 February is the International Day Against the Use of Child Soldiers – also known as Red Hand Day – and schools around the world have joined us to share their support and help raise awareness about the devastating practice of child recruitment and use which continues in multiple global conflicts.Students from the US, India and UK and beyond all took part in our Red Hand Day Campaign for schools by submitting red hand prints with their personal messages of hope and support for the thousands of children who remain trapped in armed groups and armed forces today.A huge thank you to all the schools which have sent in red hands so far and if your school would like to take part then more information about the campaign and our dedicated teaching materials can be found here.Published:
