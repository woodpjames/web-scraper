UK Army Education fails teenage recruits, warns new report
11th May, 2017
Limited range of low-grade courses undermine long-term employabilityRecruits joining the British Army at 16 and 17 are not getting the skills and qualifications they will need once they return to the civilian jobs market, according to a report from Child Soldiers International published today.‘Mind the gap: Education for minors in the British armed forces’ shows that despite the promise of excellent educational and training opportunities, the Army’s offer is extremely limited. Only low-grade qualifications are available, which fails to meet the modern standards now expected for all young people.Child Soldiers International’s report finds that:'Good qualifications and transferable skills are increasingly important for long term employment, and social mobility, as government policy makes plain. Yet those recruited by the army at the age of 16 and 17 do not get the qualifications and skills that they will need for their later working lives’ said Richard Clarke, Director of Child Soldiers International.The Royal British Legion previously published research which found that ex-Service personnel had an unemployment rate twice the national average, and that ‘lack of training, qualifications or skills’ was a particular problem for them.5The UK is the only country in the European Union to permit recruitment from age 16 into the armed forces. The United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child, the House of Commons Defence Committee and the Joint Committee on Human Rights have all called on the government to raise or review the minimum age for armed forces recruitment; the MoD has yet to do so.‘The planned extension of compulsory education to age 18 offers the best opportunity to review the minimum age for military recruitment in the UK and raise it to 18 years,’ said Richard Clarke. ‘The UK is lagging behind a growing international consensus in support of the “straight-18” position endorsed by several international and national expert bodies,’ he added.Published:
