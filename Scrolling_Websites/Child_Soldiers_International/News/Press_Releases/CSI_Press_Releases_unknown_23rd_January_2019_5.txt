Armed Forces Day: A brave face on sinking morale
23rd January, 2019
London, 24 June 2017 - Armed Forces Day takes place on Saturday with the Ministry of Defence (MoD) calling the day a ‘much-valued morale boost for troops,’; yet the 24 June events come amid sinking satisfaction in the armed forces with 62% of army recruits saying morale is ‘low’ and just 34% saying they would recommend joining to others.This year’s official event is hosted in Liverpool and events are planned nationwide for the annual day, designed to celebrate the UK’s armed forces, veterans and their families.However, Armed Forces Day, first held in 2006, arrives at a time of growing disillusionment among service personnel and mounting questions over military funding and recruitment targets.The MoD’s annual survey of armed forces personnel (AFCAS), published at the end of May, highlighted the growing internal dissatisfaction.[1]It revealed only 36% of non-officer ranks across armed forces rate their own morale as ‘high’, while soldiers’ perceptions of morale across the Army as a whole have plummeted 12 percentage points from 2016, with 62% ranking it as ‘low’.Eight per cent of non-officer personnel reported that they intend to leave the armed forces as soon as possible and 4% had already handed in notice. Two in five (40%) were actively or very actively searching for jobs outside the armed forces.Poor morale, dissatisfaction with pay, impact on family life, and low job satisfaction, were all key factors influencing decisions to leave.Information obtained by Child Soldiers International under the Freedom of Information Act reveals that last year 2,100 soldiers left the Army without completing their minimum service period. Of these, more than one-third (35%) had joined the Army before their 18th birthday.The Army has been heavily criticised in recent years for targeting 16- and 17-year-olds for recruitment into its most dangerous and least popular roles in its efforts to address shortfalls, including by all four Children’s Commissioners across the UK.[2]  Last year under-18s made up 24.1% of Army intake.[3]In January, the Army launched its newest advertising campaign, “This Is Belonging”, at a cost of £3m to try and push up recruitment figures and forthcoming Armed Forces Day events are another key recruitment tool by the MoD.The adverts target young people’s perception of the Army as a place of camaraderie and adventure. But with almost a third (27%) of army recruits actively disagreeing with the statement ‘I feel a strong personal attachment to their unit’, this belief may be misplaced.The MoD has said that enlisting minors “presents an opportunity to mitigate … shortfalls particularly for the infantry.”[4]Army recruitment is well short of the MoD’s 82,000 target and funding issues mean some believe the figure could be drastically reduced over the coming months.[5]“Armed Forces Day forms part of the MoD’s recruitment strategy to present young people with a highly edited, sanitised image of armed forces life which does not reflect the reality experienced by serving personnel,” said Rachel Taylor, spokesperson for Child Soldiers International.“The annual MoD survey of armed forces personnel shows shockingly high levels of disillusionment within the armed forces. The fact that one in three recruits enlisting under the age of 18 drop out with four years shows that many recruits were misled about what to expect when they enlisted.“Whatever you believe about the UK’s armed forces’ enlistment age – one of the lowest in the world – young people deserve to know the truth before they make a decision about signing up.”ENDSNotes for Editors:SourcesBanner image credit: Ian Capper.Published:
