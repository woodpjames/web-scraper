Letter to the US Congress
23rd January, 2019
February 12, 2017Dear Member of CongressTens of thousands of children are recruited and used in conflicts around the world. They are often abducted, beaten, and forced to commit terrible acts. On the International Day against the Use of Child Soldiers, also known as Red Hand Day, we write to urge you to take effective action this year to prevent kids and adolescents from being trafficked into armed conflict, and to aid those who have been.Thanks to the Congress’s previous work, the United States government has a powerful tool—the Child Soldiers Prevention Act of 2008 (CSPA)—to combat this practice. However, since this law came into effect in 2010, the Obama administration largely circumvented its proscriptions.The CSPA requires the State Department to identify all countries where the military or government-supported armed groups recruited or used children in the preceding year. Those governments are prohibited from receiving U.S. taxpayer-funded military assistance. However, the CSPA allows a ‘national interest’ waiver of the prohibition.We understand the need for flexibility in making challenging national security and foreign policy decisions, but the waiver has been used so extensively as to render the prohibition meaningless. The administration allowed more than $1 billion in assistance that should have been cut, while withholding only 4 percent of all taxpayer-funded military aid to countries such as South Sudan, where 17,000 children have joined combat since 2013.Furthermore, State Department officials have consistently interpreted the CSPA as not including children recruited and used by police forces. This misinterpretation has allowed Afghanistan to avoid the prohibition, despite children—some as young as 10 years old—killing and dying in the fight against the Taliban or being used for sexual purposes by their commanding officers.We ask that you make it your business and the business of the 115th Congress to see the CSPA returned to its intended role as a tool to protect children and to hold governments accountable for grave violations against children. And we ask you to look for opportunities beyond that to ensure that the U.S. government is doing all it can to prevent children from being recruited and used in war and to aid those who have.We look forward to working with you to make this happen.Sincerely,Margaret Huang, Executive Director, Amnesty International USALester A.
