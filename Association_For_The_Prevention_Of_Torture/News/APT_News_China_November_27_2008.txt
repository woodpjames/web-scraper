Torture in China: from Impunity to Accountability
November 27 2008
On 15 - 16 November, the APT was invited to participate in the final seminar of a 3 year Sino-EU project on Combating Torture in China. The seminar hosted some 160 participants and was the occasion to review the three components of the project: research, police training and monitoring places of detention as a way to prevent torture. On the latter, the results of an interesting pilot experience on monitoring places of detention, through lay-visitors, were presented and commented. Discussions also included prohibition and prevention of torture in police work, recent revisions of Criminal Procedure Law, as well as ways of moving China towards OPCAT ratification. The detention monitoring experience is due to continue, as well as a renewed EU-China project.{gallery}china{/gallery}
