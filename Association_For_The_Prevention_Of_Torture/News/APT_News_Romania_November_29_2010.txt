Soare and Others v. Romania
November 29 2010
03 March 2011. In the case of Soare and Others v. Romania the ECHR considered the case of a 19-year-old Roma man who was shot in the head by police during his arrest in Bucharest in May 2000, resulting in his semi-paralysis. In addition to finding two violations of Article 2 of the Convention in relation to the shooting of Muguel Soare (risk to life and lack of an effective investigation), the Court found that the conditions in which two witnesses, Angela Vlasceanu and Dorel Baicu, had been questioned by the police after they had observed the shooting had violated Article 3 of the Convention (prohibition of degrading treatment).Click to access the ECHR case law database
