UN and OAS joint efforts to prevent torture
January 10 2012
UN representatives, members of the Inter-American system and National Preventive Mechanisms (NPMs), along with non-governmental organizations which included the APT, gathered in Washington in order to analyze and identify coordinated actions to promote the prevention of torture and ill-treatment in Latin America.In addition the role of NGOs and the NPMs in the context of this coordination was also addressed, particularly the possibility of promoting an exchange of information between all relevant stakeholders, undertaking joint activities and following up recommendations made by both systems on torture and ill-treatment.During the course of the event, from 29-30 November 2011, the APT was invited to share its ideas and reflections on the different initiatives that could be undertaken to strengthen the cooperation between international systems of human rights protection and NGOs.

As a result of these consultations, and taking into account the strong lack of compliance from States towards recommendations in general, the international mechanisms against torture, present at the Washington meeting, agreed to produce a joint report compiling recommendations on torture, which will be promptly published.
