July 10 2011
In a landmark decision of its Development Assistance Committee (DAC), the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) granted the APT eligibility for Official Development Aid during the 9-10 June 2011 meeting of the Working Party on Statistics.APTâ€™s bid, which received support from the Swiss and Danish governments, was favourably considered by fellow DAC member States. The Danish torture rehabilitation organisation IRCT was also granted ODA eligibility. These decisions of the DAC mark a clear and welcome recognition of the contribution of human rights organisations to global development. The APT is grateful to its Swiss and Danish sponsors for their support.
