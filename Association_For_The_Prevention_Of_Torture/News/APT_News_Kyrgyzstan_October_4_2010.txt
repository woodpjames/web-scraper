Promoting Kyrgyzstan's NPM Draft Law
October 4 2010
On 4 October Kyrgyzstan's draft NPM law was scrutinized by a range  of national actors, including high-level government officials. The draft law is the outcome of a lengthy  process to develop a vision of an NPM and to anchor it in law. It is hoped that as a result of this meeting, enough  political support will be generated to ensure that the draft law  receives political backing in parliament and that the government  allocates adequate resources to the future NPM.Photos Courtesy of UNDP Kyrgyzstan
