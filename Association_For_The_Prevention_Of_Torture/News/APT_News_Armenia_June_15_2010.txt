Ashot Harutyunyan v. Armenia
June 15 2010
On 15 June 2010 the ECHR found two violations of Article 3 of the Convention in the case of Ashot Harutyunyan v. Armenia. The ruling was based on the lack of medical care given to the complainant while in detention in 2003-2004 and his having to remain seated in a metal cage during his appeal trial in the period March-May 2004. In this latter connection the Court ruled that his confinement in a cage was a stringent and humiliating measure, not justified by any real security risk, and had amounted to degrading treatment, in violation of Article 3.Click  to access the ECHR case law database
