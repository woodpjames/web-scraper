Prior to the meeting, several documents and positions papers were published by the SPT, including their rules of procedures, their guidelines on National Preventive Mechanisms, their approach to the concept of prevention of torture and their guidelines in relation to visits to States Parties. Furthermore, their fourth annual report was made available a few weeks before the session, which provides an excellent overview of the issues that the SPT would like to develop in the near future, including reprisals or safeguards, as well as a basis for discussion and cooperation with States Parties, National Preventive Mechanisms and relevant civil society organisations.As usual, the discussions during the SPT session were held in camera and a press release was produced shortly after the session, confirming the willingness of the SPT to further expand its activities with the increase in its membership.During the session, a new Bureau was elected for two years (2011- 2012) and now comprises five members:The APT believes that the expansion of the SPT and the newly elected Bureau, will contribute to strengthen the effective implementation of the OPCAT.
