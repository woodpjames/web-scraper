On 27-28 May the APT, in cooperation with the ICJ and OHCHR, and under the patronage of the Thai Ministries of Justice and Foreign Affairs, organised a two-day seminar on the implementation of the UN Convention against Torture and the reporting to the UN Committee against Torture. The event aimed to assist legal advisors from all relevant government agencies to identify which legislation needs to be amended in order for Thailand to fully comply with the text and spirit of the Convention, and what needs to be done in order for Thailand to submit a high-quality initial report to the Committee.Thailand was the last country to accede to the Convention, in October 2007, and has since shown a desire to abide by its principles, in spite of the serious challenges arising from the unrest which currently prevails in the Southern provinces of the country.International Commission of JuristsOffice of the UN High Commissioner for Human RightsIn cooperation with the Bangkok offices of the International Commission of Jurists and the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, and under the patronage of the Thai Ministries of Justice and Foreign Affairs, the APT organised a two-day seminar on the implementation of the UN Convention against Torture and the reporting to the UN Committee against Torture.
