Guaranteeing the dignity of LGBTI persons in detention
May 16 2014
Many LGBTI (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Intersex) persons have historically suffered from discrimination and violence in many aspects of their existence due to their sexual orientation and gender identity.In a number of countries, homosexuality continues to be criminalized and, in some cases, is punished with the death penalty. Including in countries where sexual diversity and gender identity is legally and socially accepted, discrimination still persists against LGBTI persons, in particular in the context of deprivation of liberty. In this situation of particular vulnerability, they often are victims of humiliation, physical violence, including sexual violence, by the penitentiary personnel and by other persons deprived of their liberty.On the occasion of the International Day against Homophobia and Transphobia, the Association for the Prevention of Torture (APT) calls on States to urgently adopt the necessary measures to ensure the effective protection of all LGBTI persons against violence affecting their dignity and integrity.Communiqué: Journée Internationale contre l’Homophobie et la Transphobie: Garantir le respect de la dignité des personnes LGBTI en détentionComunicado: Día Internacional contra la Homofobia y la Transfobia: Garantizar la dignidad de las personas LGBTI en detención
