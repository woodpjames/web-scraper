Monitoring places of detention in Brazil
October 15 2007
The APT recently travelled to north-eastern Brazil to train participants from civil society and state institutions on the methodology of monitoring and visiting places of detention. Visits to a prison, a centre for minors and a psychiatric hospital were included as part of the training. This regional workshop was the second of a series, taking place from 2006 to 2009.This was the second regional training on monitoring places of detention, involving 36 participants from 9 States of the north-east region. The participants were mainly from the civil society and in particular the pastoral carcelaria, and most had previous visiting experience. The four day workshop included training visits to three different places of detention (a prison, a centre for minors and a psychiatric hospital).This training project was first launched in Brasilia in 2006 on the initiative of the Human Rights Secretariat of the Brasilian government, which printed 5,000 copies of the APT Monitoring Guide in Portuguese - linked to training workshops in different regions of Brazil.
