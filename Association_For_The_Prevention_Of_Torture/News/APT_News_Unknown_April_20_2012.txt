National mechanisms in Central America exchange experiences
April 20 2012
Against the backdrop of a prison system dramatically affected by chronic violence and extremely poor conditions, representatives of the national mechanisms for torture prevention (NPMs) from Honduras and Costa Rica recently met in Tegucigalpa to reflect on visits to places of detention. The meeting took place a few weeks before the second visit to Honduras by the Subcommittee for the Prevention of Torture (SPT).This initiative was promoted by APTs regional office for Latin America, as part of an effort to strengthen the exchange of experiences and practices of NPMs in the region. Among the participants of the workshop were also Honduran human rights organizations and human rights agencies that regularly accompany the NMP in the country during their visits. As part of the activity, participants visited Marco Aurelio Soto Prison, including the new maximum security prison for men, and the Women's Prison PNFAS, both located in Tegucigalpa.

The APT also participated in a public event organized by the Honduran NMP for more than 60 operators of justice, where torture prevention was discussed and the claims of the families of the victims who died in February at the Prison Farm Comayagua were heard.
