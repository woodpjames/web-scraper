First Meeting of European National Preventive Mechanisms Contact Persons
January 21 2010
One of Italy's oldest seats of learning, the University of Padua, recently co-hosted the first meeting of European National Preventive Mechanisms (NPMs). On 27-28 January 2010 nominated NPM representatives from 20 countries converged on the city to participate in a two-day peer-to-peer meeting focused on torture prevention, which was the first of several activities to take place in 2010 - 2011. The overall initiative, which is known as the European NPM Project, foresees a series of so-called on-site detention monitoring trainings for NPMs as well as of thematic workshops, both of which will be hosted by the NPMs themselves.The exchange in Padua was designed to help identify possible target NPMs for the future on-site trainings and to explore issues which will form the basis of future thematic workshops. In preparation for the Padua meeting the NPM representatives were asked to highlight key issues and challenges which they have encountered in their day-to-day work with a view to discussing them with their peers in the NPM network. On the day a whole range of interesting issues emerged and were taken into consideration for future events.In addition to the areas of focus, referred to above, the meeting in Padua set the scene for the project's first substantive exchange, namely on the concept of preventive monitoring. Presentations on this important matter were given by representatives of the APT, NPMs and the UN Subcommittee on Prevention as well as former members of the Council of Europeâ€™s Committee for the Prevention of Torture.Description of the European NPM ProjectMore details and documents are available on the event websiteTanya Norton, APT Detention Monitoring AdviserMatthew Pringle, APT Europe & Central Asia Programme OfficerAudrey Olivier, APT OPCAT Coordinator
