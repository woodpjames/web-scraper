May 6 2008
APT's Annual Report  provides a general outline of APT's work during the year 2007. With the introduction of two new regional programmes in 2007 in Asia-Pacific and Middle East and North Africa (MENA), the APT is now in a position to operate globally. In 2008, the APT will be strengthening this global reach through the implementation of preventive projects in all regions.The Activities Report, which targets APT's donors, presents a detailed overview of activities and achievements for the year 2007. In order to facilitate its reading, and follow-up of our projects, the report is based on the same format as APT's Funding Appeal, which introduces APT's strategies and projects on an annual basis.
