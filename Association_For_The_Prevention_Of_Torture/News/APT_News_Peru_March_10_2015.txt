Peru continues to delay NPM designation
March 10 2015
The Peruvian government has taken the worrying decision to stop the enactment of the law, which designates the Ombudsperson as the National Preventive Mechanism (NPM), and sent it back to Congress.The Congress had approved this law in December 2014, more than seven years after Peru ratified the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture in 2006.Read APT's joint statement with the Grupo de Trabajo Contra la Tortura de la Coordinadora Nacional de Derechos Humanos and the International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims (in Spanish).
