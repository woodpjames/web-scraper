It is  anticipated that, as a result of the project's combined activities, NPMs  in the Council of Europe region will be much better placed to implement  their functions as torture prevention bodies in the light of the OPCAT.The  third Thematic Workshop in the context of the European NPM Project is  set to take place on the issues pertaining to the preparation of NPM  visits.
