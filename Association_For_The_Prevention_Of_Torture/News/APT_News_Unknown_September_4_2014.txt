CTI Forum: Governments confirm commitment to end torture
September 4 2014
No State stands alone in the fight against torture. This was the strong message from government representatives when the Convention against Torture Initiative (CTI) yesterday concluded its first annual Forum.The Convention against Torture Initiative was launched earlier this year to mark the 30th anniversary of the UN Convention against Torture (UNCAT). It focuses on long term support, regional and inter-state cooperation as the way ahead for achieving universal ratification and implementation of the Convention within the next 10 years.The first annual CTI Forum was held yesterday, 3 September, and brought together government representatives of 18 countries, from all regions of the world, and leading UN experts.The Forum was opened by the Secretary General of the Ministerial Delegation on Human Rights of Morocco, Rouwane Abderrazak and the UN Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights, Flavia Pansieri. The discussions focused on identifying not just the obstacles to ratification, but also to the practical implementation of the Convention, how governments can help each other to overcome these challenges, and on strategies to move the CTI forward.The meeting participants strongly confirmed the added value and the future potential of the Initiative as:The five countries spearheading the initiative – Chile, Denmark, Ghana, Indonesia and Morocco – will brief all UN member states, relevant experts and NGOs about the Convention against Torture Initiative during the upcoming 27th session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva. A high level CTI side event will also be organised in New York during the 69th session of the UN General Assembly.The APT has been designated to support the development of the CTI.
