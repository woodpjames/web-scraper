Immigration detention exchange with parliamentarians
October 18 2013
Why is it important for parliamentarians to visit detention centres for migrants and asylum seekers? And during a visit: what are the basic principles to follow and the key issues and areas that should be examined?These were the main questions for discussion when the APT, together with the Council of Europe, organised a second exchange with ten parliamentarians from the Committee on Migration, Refugees and Displaced Persons of the Council of Europe on 16-17 October 2013 in Zürich, Switzerland. The training included a visit to the deportation section of the Zürich Airport Prison.A member of the Swiss National Preventive Mechanism (the Swiss National Commission for the Prevention of Torture) participated and shared the NPM's experience and latest findings of the follow up visit conducted at Zürich Prison Airport.The training provided a first opportunity to operationalise the newly launched guide and video on Visiting immigration detention centres, produced jointly by the APT and the Council of Europe.
