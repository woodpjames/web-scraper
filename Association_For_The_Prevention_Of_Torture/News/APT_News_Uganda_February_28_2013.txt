Uganda roadmap for torture prevention
February 28 2013
The Prevention and Prohibition of Torture Act 2012 constitutes for Uganda an important step forward in fulfilling its international obligation to prevent torture and to fight impunity by prosecuting and punishing authors of torture. However, to have any real impact, the anti-torture law needs to be implemented in practice.This was the focus of a recent workshop, which gathered key stakeholders in Kampala to discuss the best strategies towards the effective implementation of the Act. The meeting, organised jointly by the APT and the Uganda Human Rights Commission, came up with a roadmap with recommendations on concrete measures and actions to be undertaken by the different stakeholders and institutions. The roadmap gives the Uganda Human Rights Commission the role of coordinating all initiatives in regard to the implementation of the Anti-torture Act, to avoid duplication.The APT played an important role in the adoption process of the anti-torture law and will continue to provide technical assistance and strategic advice to the Human Rights Commission in fulfilling its role of “torture prevention champion” in Uganda. The APT will also support the implementation of the roadmap recommendations through training and production of tools for effective torture prevention in Uganda.The workshop on the Prevention and Prohibition of Torture Act, organised 7-8 February 2013, included representatives from the judiciary, Directorate of Public Prosecution, parliament, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Internal Affairs, police and defence forces, prison services, Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, delegation of European Union, civil society organisations and the media.
