States must support UN resolution to protect human rights defenders
November 25 2015
Together with more than 160 other civil society organisations and human rights defenders from all over the world, APT is urging governments to support a draft resolution entitled ”Recognizing the role of human rights defenders and the need for their protection“, currently being advanced in the UN General Assembly’s Third Committee.The resolution is due to be adopted on Wednesday 25 November 2015. However, a proposal for amendments, tabled by the African Group, China and Iran, would significantly weaken the text in several ways. We now call on all Member States of the UN General Assembly to support the current draft resolution and reject the amendments.Read the open letter
