The latter body considered Kazakhstan's second period report in Geneva in November 2008, issuing some 13-pages of comments and recommendations aimed at improving the domestic situation as regards to torture and other forms of ill-treatment. The Kazakh Commissioner of Human Rights (Ombudsman's Office), Penal Reform International's Representative Office in Central Asia and the Kazakh International Bureau of Human Rights and Rule of Law convened the two-day meeting on 26-27 February to discuss the UN Committee's findings, which was attended by an array of relevant actors including by the APT.The event was the first exchange to be held on Kazakhstanâ€™s examination by the UN Committee against Torture.Some 80 or so persons attended the first day of the event, representing a range of government ministries and civil society organizations. It is hoped that the event had the effect of acting as a timely reminder for the Kazakh authorities to take stock of the UN Committee against Torture's recent Concluding Observations and to move ahead with their implementation in practice.During the first day various relevant issues were broached including the definition of torture, habeas corpus, non-refoulement, reform of the judicial system and procuracy, strengthening of the bar and the establishment of an independent police complaints body. In contrast, day two was devoted to the issue of how Kazakhstan will implement the OPCAT and various possible options were discussed. Representatives from Armenia and Moldova also attended the meeting and explained how the instrument was being implemented in these countries.AgendaLink to the UNCAT Concluding Observations
