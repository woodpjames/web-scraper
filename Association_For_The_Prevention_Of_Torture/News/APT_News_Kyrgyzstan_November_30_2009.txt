Although there have been certain set-backs in taking this process forward in 2009, the November 2009 event was a timely moment to take stock of the progress made in this regard during the year.Since the last seminar on this matter, which took place in Bishkek in April 2009, the aforementioned multi-agency working group simplified its vision of an NPM and created the corresponding draft legislation, which would anchor it in law. Prior to the latest seminar the APT and the University of Bristol’s Human Rights Implementation Centre gave their comments on it, which were largely incorporated into the version which was discussed on 30 November. Although many questions and comments arose during the public hearing, the participants appeared to be generally in favour of the working group’s vision of the country’s future NPM and the draft law underpinning it.
