The region now stands at a  crossroads to effectively implement the treaty, by instituting  independent national experts’ bodies to monitor all places of  detention.  Such a system of promoting transparency of detention places  has proven to be one of the most effective means to prevent torture and  ill-treatment.The APT Office for Latin America is scheduled to open in April in   “Ciudad del Saber”, Panama. It will contribute to the process of OPCAT   implementation in the region by promoting broad national consultations   amongst potential stakeholders, providing advice on the Protocol and the   establishment of National Preventive Mechanisms and their functioning,   as well as training on preventive monitoring. A regional colloquium on   torture prevention will be held in Panama City in June, which will   accompany the official inauguration of the Office.    An   opportunity now exists for the States of the region to put an end to a   practice of torture and inhuman detention conditions that is still   persistent in Latin-America. The APT is confident that the Regional   Office can make a real contribution to their efforts to let in the light   to places of detention, with a view to ensuring respect for the  dignity  of all persons deprived of their liberty.APT Office for Latin America staff:Director: Hugo Lorenzo  (Uruguay), jurist, former judge and former member of the UN Committee  against TortureDeputy Director:  Claudia Cesaroni (Argentina) lawyer with  over 20 years of experience  promoting the rights of persons deprived of  libertyAdministrator: Elena VillalbaFinancial  supporters of the Office:Liechtenstein (principal donor),  Denmark, European Commission, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom.Claudia Cesaroni, Deputy Director of the APT Office for Latin America
