Turkey: OPCAT Panel Discussion
January 7 2008
The Turkish NGO, Foundation for Society and Legal Studies, hosted a discussion on the possible implementation of the OPCAT in Turkey on 12 January 2008. A range of national and international speakers were invited to the event to share their thoughts on this process, including a representative from the office of the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture. In addition, the APT delivered a presentation at the meeting which focused on interesting emerging models of National Preventive Mechanisms (NPMs) from the Europe and Central Asia region.This event is one of three which have been organised by TOHAV on the OPCAT in Turkey during the period 2006-2008. The first discussion took place in Istanbul in November 2006, followed by a second seminar in Van in South-East Turkey in June 2007. The APT participated in all three events, which have made a valuable contribution to raising awareness about the OPCAT and the establishment of a national visiting body in the country.However, from the meeting in Istanbul it was clear that there appears to have been little progress by the state authorities to discuss the establishment of Turkey's future NPM with civil society. None of the participants, for example, were informed of the government's position in this regard, nor had anyone been invited to participate in such an exchange. It is the experience of the APT that an inclusive, transparent exchange of views in this connection is crucial for the legitimacy of any final mechanism.The APT will continue to collaborate with national actors, including TOHAV, to ensure that an effective National Preventive Mechanism is established in Turkey.The Optional Protocol: A Manual for PreventionThe Optional Protocol: Frequently Asked QuestionsEstablishment and Designation of National Preventive MechanismsParticipants at the Istanbul Event - Photo Copyright TOHAV
