Argentina: Detention centre interviews
October 14 2011
The APT, together with the Brazilian independent expert and forensic doctor, Jorge Paulete Vanrell, organised a workshop on conducting interviews in detention centers and identifying traces of torture on detainees.The workshop was held for official public defenders in the city of Buenos Aires, Argentina, on the 19 and 20 of September 2011, at the request of the new Registry, Systematization and Monitoring Acts of Torture and Institutional Violence Unit, whose mission is to detect, record, organise and follow up on cases of torture, other forms of institutional violence and inhumane conditions of detention.During its visit to the country, the APT took the opportunity to participate in the Congress of the Universal Abolition of the Death Penalty and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Punishment, held at the University of Law in Buenos Aires, where APT spoke about the Optional Protocol and monitoring interviews conducted in the context of torture prevention. The workshop had two main objectives, to provide staff of the Public Defenders Office the necessary tools to conduct adequate interviews in places of detention, and to identify traces of torture on people living in confinement, from a medical point of view.For the APT it was a very interesting experience to share knowledge with experts on the issue of torture from specific lines of analysis such as the medical approach.
