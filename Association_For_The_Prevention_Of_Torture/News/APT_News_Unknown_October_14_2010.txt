New Manual to Implement the Global Torture Prevention System 
October 14 2010
A new manual: 'The Optional Protocol to the UN Convention against Torture: Implementation Manual' addresses all the questions on implementation of this innovative international human rights treaty. Drawing on initial good practice from all world regions, the manual is designed to serve as a practical reference tool for international, regional and national stakeholders involved in OPCAT ratification and implementation.  Its appearance is very timely as ratifications approach 60 and the UN Subcommittee on Prevention increases in size, on 28 October 2010, to 25 members, to become the largest human rights treaty body.
