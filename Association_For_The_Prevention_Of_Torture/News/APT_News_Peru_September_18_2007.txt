NPM Advisory Mission to Peru
September 18 2007
The APT recently visited Lima to raise awareness and advise on the designation of a National Preventive Mechanism for Peru. This visit took place within a national NPM campaign led by local NGOs. Unusually, in Peru, NGOs themselves are proposing the designation of the Ombudsman Office as NPM due to its high level of legitimacy.A Working Group on Torture Prevention comprised of Peruvian NGOs has proposed that the Ombudsman Office (Defensoria del Pueblo) assume the role of NPM in Peru and is organizing a national campaign on the matter. In this context, a high-level mission of experts to Lima, Peru was organized by the APT. The APT delegates (Marco Mona, Claudia Gerez and Audrey Olivier) were accompanied by two members of the UN Subcommittee for the Prevention of Torture (Victor Rodriguez, Vice-president, and Mario Coriolano). Activities during the mission included a public conference at the Lawyers Academy (Colegio de Abogados), an audience with the plenary of the National Human Rights Council, a gathering of high-level authorities and civil society, a meeting with the Ombudsman Office (Defensoria del Pueblo) and interviews with NGOs and government representatives.This was part of the first high-level mission specifically to advise on NPM processes, taking place jointly with members of the SPT.  Additionally, it took place within a national NPM campaign.  Unusually, in Peru NGOs themselves are proposing the designation of the Ombudsman Office as NPM due to its high level of legitimacy.SPT Vice-president Víctor Rodriguez addresses the audience of the Lawyers Academy in Lima, Peru
