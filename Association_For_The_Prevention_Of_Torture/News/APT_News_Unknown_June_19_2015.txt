Working together for a #TortureFreeWorld
June 19 2015
June is Torture Awareness Month. The APT has therefore joined the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, the Anti-Torture Initiative and other partners in a global campaign for a torture-free world.A new website has been designed a platform for survivors of torture, anti-torture advocates and human rights experts and practitioners from around the world to share stories, videos, and to work together throughout June, Torture Awareness Month.As part of this campaign, we asked representatives of National Preventive Mechanism from Norway, Senegal, Kyrgyzstan, Georgia and Paraguay to share their vision of a #TortureFreeWorld:In Panama, we have worked together with the Penitentiary Academy to train the trainers on the prevention of torture, with a special focus on protecting the rights of women and migrants. We asked what a #TortureFreeWorld means to them:On June 26, the International Day in Support of Victims of Torture, Juan Méndez will host a one-hour global webinar entitled “Working Together for a #TortureFreeWorld”. Participation is free and open to everybody. Viewers are requested to register in advance and can submit their questions and comments.To learn more about the campaign and stay up-to-date on the latest developments, please visit the new campaign website: www.torturefreeworld.org.The #TortureFreeWorld website and campaign brings together the APT, the Centre for Victims of Torture (CVT), the International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims (IRCT), the National Religious Campaign Against Torture (NRCAT), the World Organization Against Torture (OMCT) and REDRESS. The Anti-Torture Initiative is a project of the Center for Human Rights & Humanitarian Law at American University Washington College of Law and the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, Juan E.
