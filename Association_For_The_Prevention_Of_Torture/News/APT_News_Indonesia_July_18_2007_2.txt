July 18 2007
On 12 November 2007, the APT and its national partner, the Institute for Policy Research and Advocacy (ELSAM), organised a round-table event in Jakarta on the implementation of the UN Convention against Torture and the ratification of the OPCAT, on the occasion of the visit to Indonesia of the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, Mr Manfred Nowak.  This event took place a mere 6 months before Indonesia’s second report to the UN Committee against Torture is reviewed, in May 2008.The work with NGOs on the reporting to the CAT in November 2007 built upon the initial meeting which took place in Jakarta in July 2007. On that occasion, participants from the Indonesian NGO Coalition against Torture appointed thematic coordinators responsible for collecting and analyzing data that should feature in the report.See also: Indonesia: Promoting the implementation of the Convention against Torture and its Optional Protocol, January to June 2007.The Institute for Policy Research and Advocacy (ELSAM)World Organisation against Torture (OMCT)Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the NetherlandsFederal Department of Foreign Affairs of Switzerland
