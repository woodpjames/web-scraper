August 5 2008
From 28 July - 6 August the APT visited Nepal to conduct a series of detention monitoring workshops in Kathmandu and Nepalgunj, in cooperation with Advocacy Forum and the Field Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. The workshops, attended by representatives of the National Human Rights Commission, Nepal Bar Association and human rights NGOs active in this field, sought to increase the capacity to effectively monitor all types of detention facilities. In addition to the practical aspects of detention monitoring, participants discussed other measures to prevent torture and other forms of ill-treatment, such as the need to make torture an enforceable crime in Nepali penal legislation and the possible ratification of the OPCAT.In the context of this joint project, the APT's Monitoring Places of Detention: A Practical Guide was translated into Nepali.
