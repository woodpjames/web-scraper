Prospects for the ratification of the OPCAT and setting-up of an NPM in Italy
March 31 2010
The question of Italy finally ratifying the OPCAT was again discussed recently, when the University of Padua's Interdepartmental  Centre on Human Rights and the Rights of People hosted a meeting on the  issue. The event brought together various international and  national actors to deliberate this matter and presentations were  delivered by representatives of the UN Subcommittee on Prevention, APT,  Estonian NPM – Office of the Chancellor of Justice, European Committee  for the Prevention of Torture as well as various Italian NGOs, lawyers'  associations and past and present parliamentarians.The question of Italy finally ratifying the OPCAT was once again up for discussion recently, when the University of Padua's Interdepartmental Centre on Human Rights and the Rights of People hosted a meeting on the issue. The half-day event brought together various international and national actors to deliberate this matter and presentations were delivered by representatives of the UN Subcommittee on Prevention, APT, Estonian NPM – Office of the Chancellor of Justice, European Committee for the Prevention of Torture as well as various Italian NGOs, lawyers' associations and past and present parliamentarians. The variety of actors made for an interesting discussion.The consultation was the first meeting on the question of Italy ratifying the OPCAT in several years.Although Italy signed the OPCAT very early on in August 2003, progress has been slow with regards to ratification of the instrument. In 2007 draft legislation aimed at establishing an NHRI, which would have also assumed the NPM mandate, floundered after the then government collapsed.However, in February 2010 during its Universal Periodic Review by the UN Human Rights Council Italy confirmed that it would ratify the OPCAT and establish an NHRI in the course of the year. The overriding aim of the consultation meeting in Padua was to revive the discussion on the ratification of the OPCAT in Italy and to explore possible models for a future NPM. It is hoped that the meeting will set the scene for future such exchanges on this important question.Photos courtesy of the University of Padua
