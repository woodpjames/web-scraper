March 27 2012
The Ritter Museum is exhibiting the 19 prints of the "Artists against Torture" portfolio since 11 March and until 1st May 2012.The initiative comes from Marli Hoppe-Ritter, the founder of the Museum, who purchased a portfolio some years ago, and is now putting part of it on sale. All benefits of the sale will be donated to APT's torture prevention work. APT's Former President Marco Mona and long time supporter of the "Artists against Torture" initiative Ruedi Mettler-Wahlandt were both invited by the Ritter Museum to the inauguration of the exhibition on 10th March. The APT is most grateful to the Ritter Museum for the initiative. Out of the 150 limited editions produced as part of the initiative, only 5 are still on sale. You may contact the APT Secretariat for a quote and additional information on the portfolio.
