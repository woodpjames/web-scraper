November 23 2009
On 25 November, the APT participated in a national seminar on the OPCAT co-organised by the Australian Human Rights Commission  and the Asia Pacific Forum, in Sydney. The seminar gathered approximately 60 participants from federal and state authorities, academics, human right commission and NGOs. During the seminar, the participants discussed the OPCAT implementation in Australia and explored the challenges faced by a federal state in the process of implementation towards the establishment of a National Preventive Mechanism.
