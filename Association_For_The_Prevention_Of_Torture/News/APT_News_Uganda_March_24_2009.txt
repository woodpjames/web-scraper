Strengthening the prevention of torture in Uganda
March 24 2009
Uganda has ratified most of the International Human Rights Treaties including the United Nations Convention against Torture (UNCAT), and has demonstrated clear engagement and cooperation with international and regional human rights mechanisms. To assist Uganda in fulfilling its international obligations under UNCAT, a coalition of human rights organizations, in collaboration with the APT, have initiated a draft Bill on prohibition and prevention of torture in Uganda. A meeting on this draft Bill for key national stakeholders took place on Friday 27 March in Kampala.General Objective:Specific objectives:African Centre for Treatment and Rehabilitation of Torture Victims (ACTV)Uganda Human Rights Commission (UHRC)Press Briefing Note in: PDF WordDownload the Report of the Consultative MeetingDownload the Draft Torture Bill
