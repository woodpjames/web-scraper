Egypt: Strengthening independent inspection mechanisms
March 18 2008
Upon invitation of the Egyptian National Council for Childhood and Motherhood (NCCM), the APT participated in a series of roundtables on juvenile justice reform, which took place from 2 - 5 March in Cairo. The workshops were an opportunity for key stakeholders involved in juvenile justice in Egypt to discuss potential areas for reform in the light of the recently adopted comment of the United Nation's Committee for the Rights of the Child (General Comment no. 10) and proposed amendments to the Egyptian child code.The APT provided inputs on independent inspections for places of deprivation of liberty for children, illustrating the international obligations with examples of independent inspection mechanisms from around the world. The roundtables took place in the frame of a project aiming at protecting women and children from violence, which the NCCM implements with the assistance of the United States Agency for International Development.
