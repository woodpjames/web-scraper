Preventing torture in the context of democratic transitions in North Africa
June 5 2012
Regional workshop, Rabat, 9 - 10 June 2012: North Africa is currently characterized by a context of institutional and legislative reforms and democratic transitions. National actors face major challenges in their aspirations to strengthen guarantees for the promotion and protection of human rights. They are confronted with a double problematic: how to deal with grave violations of human rights perpetrated in the past, namely torture, while establishing guarantees of non-repetition for such violations, including measures to prevent torture?These questions will be debated in a workshop that the APT organizes jointly with the Interministerial Delegation for Human Rights of the government of Morocco and the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, in Rabat, on 9 - 10 June 2012. The workshop aims at providing a space for an open exchange and for sharing of experiences among selected government officials, representatives of National Human Rights Institutions and NGOs from Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco and Tunisia. Key UN human rights mechanisms concerned with the prevention of torture in times of democratic transition will also be represented. The essence of the discussion will be made available in a summary report.
