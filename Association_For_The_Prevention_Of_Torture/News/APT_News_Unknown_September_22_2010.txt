The first part of this meeting was dedicated to fostering a dialogue among the different thematic departments of the Human Rights and Social Assistance Secretariat of Rio de Janeiro that deal with related issues, in order to build an integrated agenda to prevent and combat torture in the State of Rio de Janeiro through the articulation of actions and policies carried out by the Secretariat.

The second part of the meeting brought together civil society organizations and governmental actors to discuss in detail the provisions of the Law 5778 and to reflect upon implementation measures and the role of civil society in this process.
