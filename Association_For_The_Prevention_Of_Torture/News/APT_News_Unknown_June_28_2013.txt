Asia Pacific NHRIs learn about detention of migrant workers
June 28 2013
Migrant workers in detention are often in a situation of vulnerability – many lack knowledge of local language, have no family connections or support networks, and have limited resources.National Human Rights institutions (NHRIs) can play an important role in upholding and protecting their rights through advocacy, law reform efforts and the important role of monitoring places where migrant workers are detained.The APT collaborates with the Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions (APF)’s training on the rights of migrant workers, to provide input into discussions on the situation regarding detention of migrant workers, and the key role that NHRIs can play when migrant workers are detained.  Last month, sixteen NHRIs participated in a workshop, held in Manila, Philippines.For full story, see APF’s website
