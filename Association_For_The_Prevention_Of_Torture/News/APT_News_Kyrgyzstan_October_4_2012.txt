UN torture prevention body visits Kyrgyzstan
October 4 2012
Five members of the UN Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture visited Kyrgyzstan in September 2012.The SPT visit took place a few months after the UN Special Rapporteur mission (December 2011) and aimed to assist the authorities in adopting measures to decrease the risks of torture and other ill-treatment in places where persons are detained.The SPT delegation monitored the conditions of detention and treatment of detainees in several places of detention, including temporary detention places, police detention centres, pre-trial detention centres, detention places under the National Security Committee, correctional detention centres, juvenile detention centres and medical facilities – including psychiatric institutions. The SPT also took this opportunity to promote the prompt establishment of the National Preventive Mechanism, which law was signed by the President early July 2012. Finally, the SPT encouraged the government to make the report of the SPT public in order to be able to apply for support from the OPCAT Special Fund.
