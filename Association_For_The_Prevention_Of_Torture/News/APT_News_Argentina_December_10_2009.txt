Advocating for the Adoption of NPM laws in Argentina
December 10 2009
The APT organised a high-level mission to Argentina from 10 to 15 December to advocate for the adoption of laws to create National Preventive Mechanisms (NPMs) at the federal and provincial levels.Argentina ratified the OPCAT in 2004 but has yet to designate its NPM due in part to the challenges of federalism. Nevertheless, innovative solutions have been proposed. The federal Congress is currently reviewing three draft laws to create a system of torture prevention comprising a national coordinating body, as well as local bodies in each province. Thus, the legislative branches of several provinces are considering draft laws for the creation of such provincial mechanisms.The Federal Capital of Buenos Aires has already approved NPM legislation, the first decentralized entity of a federal state party to OPCAT to do so. For this purpose, the APT organised activities in the Provinces of Chaco and Buenos Aires, as well as in the Federal Capital. A member of the UN Subcommittee on Torture Prevention (SPT), Wilder Tayler, accompanied these OPCAT promotion activities.
