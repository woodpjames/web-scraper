APT Responds to EU Green Paper on Detention
March 2 2012
The APT welcomed an opportunity to respond to the current EU Green Paper on 'Strengthening mutual trust in the European judicial area â€“ A Green Paper on the application of EU criminal justice legislation in the field of detention' and submitted its response to the EU on 30 November 2011.In doing so, the organisation focussed on two of the ten questions posed by the EU, namely how could monitoring of detention conditions by the Member States be better promoted and how could the EU encourage prison administrations to network and establish best practice?The organisation's decision to comment on these two specific questions was above all motivated by the APT's historical commitment to promoting in practice the concept of independent monitoring of all places of detention as a means to prevent torture and other forms of ill-treatment as well as its longtime involvement in promoting effective legal frameworks.
