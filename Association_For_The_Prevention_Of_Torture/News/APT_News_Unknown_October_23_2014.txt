October 23 2014
States Parties to the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture (OPCAT) today elected 13 members to the UN Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture (SPT), for a term of four years. The APT wishes them all the best for the forthcoming period of membership.Of the elected members, seven have already served four years within the Subcommittee. They were re-elected for a second term of four years:Six new members were elected:The APT believes that the election of these new members will contribute significantly to the work of the SPT. The election of eight women confirms the recent welcome trend towards a better gender balance within the SPT, with 13 women among its 25 members.The SPT will also benefit from the professional expertise of the new members, which includes healthcare, psychology, law and forensic medicine, and experience in the administration of justice.Hopefully the election of two new African members will encourage more States in the region to join the OPCAT system, by ratifying and effectively implement the treaty.The APT has promoted key qualities for human rights treaty bodies for several years.
