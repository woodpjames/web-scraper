The UN Country Team Macedonia, Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the APT convened a range of government, civil society and ombudsperson representatives to examine this issue, drawing on the positive practices and experiences of other countries in this respect. Two APT staff members attended the event as international experts.The event was also used to formally launch the Macedonian translation of the APT publication, 'Guide to the Establishment and Designation of National Preventive Mechanisms', which has kindly been made possible by the UN Resident Coordinator of the UN Country Team Macedonia.A primary aim of the seminar was to advance an open and inclusive national discussion on the implementation of the OPCAT, which Macedonia signed in September 2006.During the seminar it transpired that the authorities responsible for the implementation of the instrument, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, had consulted the Ombudsman's Office with regard to it becoming the country’s NPM, but without raising the issue with Macedonia's wider human rights community. Nonetheless, relevant local actors are now looking into the possibility of organizing a follow-up event to address this question. It is still hoped that some form of dialogue, encompassing state and civil society actors, can be attained regarding the challenge of putting in place a national visiting mechanism as required by the OPCAT.The APT will continue to monitor developments in the country concerning the designation or establishment of the NPM.Guide on the Establishment and Designation of National Preventive Mechanisms - Macedonian (Print copies are available from the UN Resident Coordinator).Agenda
