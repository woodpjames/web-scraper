Special Rapporteur on Torture holds expert consultation on torture and gender
November 5 2015
The UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, Juan E. Mendéz, hosts an expert consultation in Washington on 5 and 6 November about gender perspectives on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment of punishment.The objective of the meeting is to inform the upcoming thematic report of the Special Rapporteur, which will be presented to the UN Human Rights Council in March 2016.The APT welcomes Mr. Méndez’s initiative to further clarify and develop standards related to the prohibition of torture and ill-treatment from a gender perspective.As a contribution to the consultation, the APT submitted a public briefing note to the Special Rapporteur, focusing on the situation of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons (LGBT) and their specific exposure to torture and other ill-treatment, that stem from discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Such discrimination not only exacerbates the risks for LGBT persons deprived of liberty but also calls for a specific approach to tackle torture and ill-treatment motivated by homophobia and transphobia.
