Iskandrov v. Russia
September 24 2010
On 23 September the European Court found Russia to have violated Articles 3 and 5 of the Convention, after having unlawfully removed the leader of the Tajik opposition, Mukhamadruzi Iskandarov, from Russia to Tajikistan in April 2005, where he was ill-treated. In the case of Iskandrov v. Russia the Court ruled that the manâ€™s removal to Tajikistan had been in breach of the obligation of the Russian authorities to protect him against risks of ill-treatment. Moreover, his removal by Russian state agents had no basis in law and his detention had neither been acknowledged nor logged in any arrest or detention records and had thus constituted a complete negation of right to liberty and security of people.
