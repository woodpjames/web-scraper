March 14 2013
Yesterday, APT delivered an oral statement in the Human Rights Council during the consideration of the UPR Working Group Report on Argentina.In its statement, APT urged the responsible authorities in Argentina to quickly take all of the necessary measures to implement the law which created the National Committee for the Prevention of Torture and the National System of Prevention and to adopt safeguards to guarantee that the procedure for the selection of members will be open, transparent and include participation by civil society.The law was adopted in November 2012 and is an important step forward for torture prevention in Argentina.What is the UPR?  Universal Periodic Review (UPR) is a process in which the human rights record of every United Nations Member State is reviewed by other States. Each State is reviewed once every four years.  Every Member State participated in the first cycle (2008-2011) and now the second cycle (2012-2016) is underway.
