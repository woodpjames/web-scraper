Georgia: A Practical Training for Judges and Prosecutors
March 5 2009
As a result of the event a group of around 20-25 judges, prosecutors, defence lawyers and Ombudsman's Office employees learnt more about their duties and responsibilities to prevent and investigate acts of torture and other forms of ill-treatment. In addition to enhancing the knowledge of the participants in the area of torture prevention, the event was designed to encourage greater use of the University of Essex's invaluable manual in Georgia and an increased awareness of the important lessons contained therein.The seminar was the third of several events planned on the subject in Georgia in recent times, the previous one being held in Tbilisi in November 2008. It is envisaged that a fourth seminar for judges and prosecutors will take place in the latter part of 2009.AgendaLink to the Georgian version  of the University of Essexâ€™s 'Combating Torture: A Manual for Judges and Prosecutors'
