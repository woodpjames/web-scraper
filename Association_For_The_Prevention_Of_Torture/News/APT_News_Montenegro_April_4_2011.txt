Building An Effective NPM in Montenegro
April 4 2011
APT was in the Montenegrin capital, Podgorica, for two OPCAT  related events which took place on 5-6 April 2011. The first event was a capacity building training for what is most  likely to become the country's NPM, the Ombudsperson's Office or  Protector of Human Rights and Freedoms. On 6 April the APT participated in a round-table event, 'International  Standards in Torture Prevention and their Implementation in  Montenegro'.
