Torture Prevention in Mexico
October 13 2011
Aiming at strengthening the work of National Preventive Mechanisms designated under the OPCAT, the APT facilitated a two-day workshop with the NPM of Mexico (MNPT) on 24-25 August 2011 in Mexico City. The APT assisted the internal development process of the MNPT and facilitated a self-assessment of its methods of work, as a follow-up to a previous workshop held in August 2009.In addition, the APT provided the members of the mechanism with tools regarding the methodology of visits to places of detention and the drafting of reports and recommendations, based on good practices from other existing NPMs and the Guidelines of the UN Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture (SPT).To support the implementation of the OPCAT in Mexico at the local level, the APT is planning to organize in the coming months two workshops in different Mexican states to gather key actors (at the international, federal and state level) to facilitate a dialogue on torture prevention.Documents:Fourth Annual Report of the SPTPartner Organisations:National Preventive Mechanism against Torture
