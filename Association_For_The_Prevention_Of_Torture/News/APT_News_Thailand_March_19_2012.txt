March 19 2012
In an oral statement to the Human Rights Council, the APT urges Thailand to fulfill its obligations under UNCAT by ensuring that the amendments to its laws fully implement the treaty including not only criminalizing torture but also the obligations to take measures to prevent and investigate torture and other ill-treatment and to provide redress to the victims.Whilst regretting that Thailand did not accept recommendations to ratify OPCAT, the APT also welcomed the commitment made during the Universal Periodic Review to undertake a study on OPCAT ratification.Oral Statement by APT (PDF)
