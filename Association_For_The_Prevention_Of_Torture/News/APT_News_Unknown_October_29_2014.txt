One month since the disappearance of 43 Mexican students
October 29 2014
For a month now, 43 Mexican students - aged from 17 to 25, from the teacher training college Normal Rural Raúl Isidro Burgos in Ayotzinapa - have been missing after a series of violent episodes that allegedly involved, among others, Iguala’s municipal police in the state of Guerrero, Mexico.These tragic events, in which 6 people were killed and 20 injured, once again reveal the social cost of the so-called 'War on Drugs' in Mexico and its failed security policy. Both have resulted in more violence and serious human rights violations committed by the security forces themselves, and increasing levels of state corruption.The APT has joined more than 80 organisations from various regions of the world to condemn the enforced disappearance of the 43 Mexican students in the context of that country’s 'War on Drugs' and failed security policies, which only serve to spawn more violence and institutional corruption. We urge the Mexican State to investigate the disappearances and punish these crimes.Read the Joint Statement
