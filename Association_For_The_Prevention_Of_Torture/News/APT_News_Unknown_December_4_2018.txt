New practical guide on the protection of LGBTI persons deprived of liberty
December 4 2018
In this practical guide – “Towards the effective protection of LGBTI persons deprived of liberty” – the APT offers practical guidance on how to account for sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics in a torture prevention framework.Historically subjected to discrimination and abuse across all regions of the world, lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and intersex (LGBTI) persons are particularly exposed to the risk of ill-treatment or even torture when deprived of their liberty. This manual aims to fill the existing gap on the topic, in particular for oversight bodies. The fruit of years of research, the publication benefited from the wealth of experience of many experts from diverse regions and backgrounds.APT’s guide provides information on systemic patterns of discrimination specifically targeting LGBTI individuals; advice on particular aspects of the monitoring methodology; and in-depth guidance in relation to prisons, police stations, and immigration detention facilities. Primarily designed for detention monitoring bodies, it is also intended for police and prison staff, civil society organisations, policy-makers and legal professionals.The guide also acknowledges the enormous diversity of realities comprised in the LGBTI acronym, and the different regional contexts. Designed as a practical tool, it details specific practices that increase the risk of ill-treatment, includes relevant case law and good practices, and provides "monitoring checklists" for oversight bodies.“This guide - prepared by the Association for the Prevention of Torture with great attention to the current state of international human rights law, best practices in the field of torture prevention, and the wealth of experience of the extraordinary group of experts that provided its substance - will provide an understanding of the factors of risk and the acts, patterns and extreme manifestations of torture and ill treatment against LGTBI persons, and is an invaluable blueprint for any conceptual understanding of these.” Victor Madrigal-Borloz, UN Independent Expert on sexual orientation and gender identity
