Tunisia: First State in North Africa to ratify the OPCAT!
July 26 2011
Tunisia ratified the OPCAT on 29 June 2011, thereby becoming the first State Party to the instrument in North Africa. The APT is encouraging the Tunisian government to establish a National Preventive Mechanism (NPM) as soon as possible, so that persons deprived of liberty in this country can benefit from regular preventive visits. The APT stresses the importance of a participatory decision making process when deciding upon the institutional nature of the future NPM and encourages active civil society participation in this process.
