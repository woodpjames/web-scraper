New Partnerships for the Prevention of Torture in Europe
November 5 2009
The 20th anniversary of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT) was marked in Strasbourg on 06 November 2009 with a high-profile conference 'New Partnerships for the Prevention of Torture in Europe'. This large-scale event, which was co-organised by the CPT and APT, gathered for the first time representatives from the CPT, the UN Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture (SPT), European National Preventive Mechanisms (NPMs) and civil society.Discussions focused on how the different actors in torture prevention in Europe, namely the CPT, the international and national preventive mechanisms established under the OPCAT can address the challenge of multiplicity and develop synergies and partnerships. During the rich exchange in the three panels dealing with exchange of information, coherence of standards and implementation of recommendations, as well as in the plenary some critical issues were raised, some good practices highlighted and concrete ways forward proposed.European NPM ProjectIn addition, on 5 November the 'European NPM Project of the Council of Europe' , in which the APT is the implementing partner, hosted its first Peer-to-Peer Annual Meeting of designated NPMs in Europe. This meeting of some 20 national preventive bodies discussed the implementation of the Project as well as exchanged practices regarding the production and dissemination of NPM annual reports.The 'European NPM Project of the Council of Europe' (2010-2011) aims at strengthening the capacity of designated NPMs in Europe to function effectively. It will do so by providing them on-site training modules on detention monitoring methodology for different types of places of detention, thematic workshops and networking. The Project is also conceived as a forum for exchanges between the CPT, the UN-SPT and the NPM, and constitutes therefore a first way of implementing the "new partnership on torture Prevention in Europe".CPT President calls for an end to impunity for perpetrators of tortureBackground PaperProgrammeThe European Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT)Council of Europe{gallery}strasbourg09{/gallery}
