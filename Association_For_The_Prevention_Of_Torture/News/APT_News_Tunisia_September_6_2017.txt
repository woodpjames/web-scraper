Tunisian NPM: Strategic thinking on the mandate’s basic aspects
September 6 2017
Over a year after the National Body for the Prevention of Torture (INPT) became operational, the APT, together with the World Organisation against Torture (OMCT), organised a strategic retreat in Hammamet from 28 to 30 July 2017 for all INPT members. The aim of this retreat was to provide a forum for collective discussion and reflection on the basic aspects of the National Preventive Mechanism (NPM)’s mandate.Creating a new institution from scratch, composed of a diverse group of individuals and given a very ambitious preventive mandate is not without challenges, especially in a society in transition. It is therefore important to take the time to develop a sense of belonging and common vision among members, as well as to define the strategies and priorities in this crucial phase of establishment.Thanks to an interactive and dynamic methodology, the exchanges between the 11 members present were fruitful and took place in a relaxed and serene atmosphere. The strengths and challenges of the INPT were analysed as well as the skills and multidisciplinarity of the whole, in order to valorise and strengthen the expertise of each in the service of the prevention of torture.The APT has been supporting the Tunisian NPM since its inception and responds to emerging needs by offering its comparative expertise in the implementation of the Optional Protocol to the United Nations Convention against Torture (OPCAT). In July, the APT facilitated accompanying visits of two INPT members to the French NPM. The APT is also organising a regional meeting in Rabat in September to enable INPT members to meet their counterparts from the Mauritanian NPM and from the future Moroccan NPM.
