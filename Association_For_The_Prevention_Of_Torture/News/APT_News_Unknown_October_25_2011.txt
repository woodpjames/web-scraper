Gorobet v. Moldova
October 25 2011
On 11 October 2011 the Court found a violation of Article 3 of the ECHR (prohibition of inhuman or degrading treatment) in the case of Gorobet v. Moldova owing to his forced confinement and psychiatric treatment in a hospital in Costesti in 2008 for 41 days.The Court found, among other matters, that his confinement had caused him severe mental suffering amounting to inhuman and degrading treatment. It also noted that, as his confinement had neither been lawful nor medically necessary, he had been detained for a considerable length of time and had not been allowed to have contact with the outside world during his confinement, such unlawful and arbitrary treatment had at the very least been capable to arouse in him feelings of fear, anguish and inferiority. Accordingly, the psychiatric treatment amounted at least to degrading treatment, in violation of Article 3.
