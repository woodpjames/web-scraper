APT urges Guatemala to criminalise torture
March 18 2013
On Thursday 14 March 14 APT urged Guatemala to take key torture prevention measures in an oral statement presented in the UN Human Rights Council during the adoption of the final outcome of the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) of Guatemala.In the statement we urged Guatemala to finalise the selection for its national preventive mechanism according to the requirements of the Optional Protocol to the Convention Against Torture (OPCAT); implement the measures it agreed to take during the UPR to improve prison conditions; and to amend the criminal code to criminalize torture in line with Article 1 of the Convention against Torture.What is UPR? Universal Periodic Review (UPR) is a process in which the human rights record of every United Nations Member State is reviewed by other States. Each State is reviewed once every four years. Every Member State participated in the first cycle (2008-2011) and now the second cycle (2012-2016) is underway. The APT advocates for States to make UPR recommendations to other States on torture prevention. In addition, we make oral statements when the final outcome of the review is adopted by the UN Human Rights Council, which is the only opportunity for NGOs to speak on the floor of the Human Rights Council during the entire UPR process.
