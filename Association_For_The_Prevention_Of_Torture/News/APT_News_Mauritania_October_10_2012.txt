Mauritania's accession to the torture prevention treaty welcomed
October 10 2012
The APT congratulates Mauritania for the ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture (OPCAT).On October 3, 2012, the Islamic Republic of Mauritania became the 64th State Party to this innovative treaty aiming at preventing violations of human rights rather than healing the deep wounds they cause. After Lebanon and Tunisia, Mauritania became the third state party to the OPCAT in the North African and Middle Eastern region; a region in which torture prevention is making headways as a result of the "dignity revolution‚Äù that started in 2011.

The Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Mauritania, Mr. Hamadi Ould Hamadi, presented the instrument of ratification of the OPCAT in New York to the UN General Secretary Ban Ki-moon on September 30th, together with the instrument of ratification of the Convention for the Protection of All Persons against Enforced Disappearance.

"The simultaneous ratification of the treaties for the prevention of torture and against enforced disappearance is a clear sign of political will and is a good practice that we encourage other states in the region to follow," said Secretary General of the APT, Mark Thomson. "The two agreements reinforce each other. If applied with determination, these two texts will contribute to the prevention of a lot of suffering and to a real strengthening of the rule of law. "
