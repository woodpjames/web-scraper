Call for candidates to new Tunisian NPM
November 28 2013
The National Constituent Assembly (ANC) of Tunisia - the transitional parliament - opened a public call for candidates to search for the future members of the National Authority for the Prevention of Torture.In a press release, the APT and OMCT draw attention to the relatively short time given to candidates for applying and encourage a wide and fast dissemination of the appeal.The APT and OMCT welcome the procedure of a public call to search for the members of the Authority, which is the National Preventive Mechanism established under the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture (OPCAT), as a mean to finding the best candidates for this crucial mandate for the protection of human rights in Tunisia. Given the participatory process of the development of the law creating the Authority, we also recommend that civil society participate in an advisory capacity in the selection of the members.
