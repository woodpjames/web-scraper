Strengthening the Capacity of the Moldovan National Preventive Mechanism
January 23 2009
Within the framework of a Council of Europe Programme to Strengthen National Preventive Mechanisms (NPMs) in Europe, the APT organised the first workshop for the Moldovan NPM, in Chisinau, from 27 to 29 January. This introductory workshop was aimed at analyzing the implications and challenges of being an NPM. In Moldova, the NPM is quite a unique body: one of the 4 Ombudsmen is the Chair of a new Consultative Council composed of ten members of the civil society. During the workshop, the NPM as well as staff of the Ombudsman's Office discussed and defined an overall strategy for exercising the NPM mandate. The workshop also focused on core issues for the NPMs practical work, such as planning regular visits vs selecting facilities to be visited, as well as drafting reports and recommendations.{gallery}moldova09{/gallery}
