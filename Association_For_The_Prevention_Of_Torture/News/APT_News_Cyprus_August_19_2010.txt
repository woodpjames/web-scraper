Shchukin and Others v. Cyprus
August 19 2010
On 29 July the ECHR found that in the case of Shchukin and Others v. Cyprus the latter had violated Article 3 of the Convention for failing to conduct an effective investigation into Oleg Shchukinâ€™s complaint that he had been ill-treated by immigration police in Limassol in February 2003. The Court ruled that the investigation had not been independent, impartial and subject to public scrutiny and the competent authorities had not acted with exemplary diligence and promptness, awarding the complainant 12 000 Euros.
