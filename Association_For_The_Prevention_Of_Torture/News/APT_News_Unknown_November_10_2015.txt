The OSCE is putting an enhanced focus on torture prevention. A new position of OSCE Adviser on Torture Prevention has been created within its Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) in Warsaw.The new adviser has recently taken up her position. She was recruited to develop and coordinate OSCE activities and support related to the prevention of torture, and to promote synergies between different OSCE institutions and field operations.The APT welcomes this reinforcement of ODIHRâ€™s capacity in the area of prevention of torture, which we have long been advocating for. We look forward to a continued collaboration with the OSCE and to further cooperation with its Adviser on Torture Prevention.
