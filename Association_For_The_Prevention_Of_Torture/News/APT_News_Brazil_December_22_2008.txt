Civil Society and OPCAT Implementation in Brazil
December 22 2008
APT returned to Brazil from 13-17 December to take part in several activites, including participating in the 11th National Human Rights Conference. Activities in the country started with a one day seminar 'Preventing Torture in Brazil: the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention against Torture', held as part of the Annual General Assembly of the National Human Rights Movement. The seminar brought together 25 representatives of different human rights organizations from 17 states in Brazil. APT was also invited by the Human Rights Secretary of Brazil to participate in the meeting of the National Committee to Prevent and Combat Torture, currently finalising a draft bill of law which would implement OPCAT and create a National Preventive Mechanism, and was asked to review the project, offering its observations and comments, specifically on the issue of independence and the procedure for the appointment of members.National Human Rights Movement (Movimento Nacional dos Direitos Humanos – MNDH)Human Rights Secretary of Brazil (Secretaria Especial dos Direitos Humanos da Presidência da República – SEDH)Agenda (Portuguese)APT Paper: 'Civil Society and National Preventive Mechanisms' (Portuguese)
