Brazil: APT calls on President to veto bill of law that dangerously broadens competence of military courts
October 16 2017
The APT appealed to Brazilian President, Michel Temer, to veto a bill of law (PLC 44/2016) that gives military courts jurisdiction over intentional crimes against life committed by military personnel against civilians during certain security operations. If enacted, the bill – that was just approved by the Federal Senate – would constitute a major setback for human rights in Brazil, where the task of combating impunity and ensuring accountability for acts of torture and other forms of ill-treatment remains a decisive challenge for justice.In its letter, the APT emphasized that such a transfer of jurisdiction would contravene Brazil´s commitment to implement the recommendations, made by the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture following his visit in 2015, that any human rights violations committed by military agents against civilians be tried by civilian criminal courts.Read the full letter here
