Juvenile Detention Monitoring in Uruguay
August 22 2008
On 26 and 27 of August, APT and the Uruguayan Committee for the Rights of the Child held a training session in Montevideo for Uruguayan civil society organisations on practical skills for monitoring the situation of children in detention. Participants analysed their own juvenile detention monitoring practice in light of international best practices for the prevention of torture. A representative of the Paraguayan Interinstitutional Commission on Children in Detention co-facilitated the session and shared her institution's experiences with participants. This training took place in the context of a larger APT research and practice project on juvenile detention monitoring that is being developed in various regions of the world, and aims to make an important and practical contribution to the prevention of violence against children in juvenile justice systems.
