Summer School for NPMs on the Nelson Mandela Rules
March 28 2017
Members and staff of National Preventive Mechanisms are invited to apply to a Summer School on using the Nelson Mandela Rules in detention monitoring. The Summer School will take place in Bristol, UK, 14 - 17 August 2017.The Summer School on “Detention monitoring applying the UN Nelson Mandela Rules” is the second training event organised by Penal Reform International and the Human Rights Implementation Centre, University of Bristol, in partnership with the APT. The training aims at increasing participants’ capacity to prevent torture and ill-treatment using the revised Nelson Mandela Rules. It will also provide an opportunity to meet and network with experts in the field and representatives from other NPMs.With the majority of the revised Rules relating to the prohibition and prevention of torture and other forms of ill-treatment in detention, it is critical that detention monitoring bodies use the updated Rules. The four-day programme is therefore designed to equip the participants with the necessary technical knowledge on key provisions, so they can assess conditions of detention against the Rules and develop stronger recommendations.The number of participants is limited to 20. A good command of English is required. For more information on costs and how to apply, see PRI’s website.Deadline for registration is 17 May.Download the Summer School flyerDownload the draft agenda
