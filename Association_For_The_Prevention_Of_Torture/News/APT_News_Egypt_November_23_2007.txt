The Egyptian National Council on Human Rights (NCHR) organised a workshop entitled 'Together to Reach a Strategy Against Torture' on 19 November 2007. The objective of the workshop was to produce concrete recommendations on how to prevent torture in Egypt, which will be presented to a national 'citizenship conference' on 25 November and subsequently to the government of Egypt.The workshop was opened by the President of the NCHR, Dr. Boutros Boutros Ghali, who outlined four main elements for a strategy against torture, including supervision of places of detention.The APT made a presentation on 'The obligation to prevent torture: legal obligations and practical measures', and assured that the issue of monitoring places of detention as an effective preventive measure will have a prominent place in the recommendations.
