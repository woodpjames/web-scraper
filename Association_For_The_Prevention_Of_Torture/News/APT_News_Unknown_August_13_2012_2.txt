Judges must exclude all evidence obtained by torture
August 13 2012
The APT joined forces with the National Judicial Academy of Nepal (NJA) to urge judges to apply the international prohibition of using confessions and other evidence obtained through torture, as provided in article 15 of the UN Convention against Torture, during a one day event in Dhulikhel, on 5 August.Experts from the UN Committee against Torture and the Supreme Courts of Nepal and Mauritius critically examined the use of confession evidence during a one day event which provided practical guidance to judges in the application in the exclusionary rule. Participant judges from across Nepal joined the event to share their experiences and to condemn the use of tainted evidence, which is inherently unreliable and serves to encourage police to use torture against criminal suspects.
