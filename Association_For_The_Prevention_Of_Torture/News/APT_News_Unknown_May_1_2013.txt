Concerns about threats against Venezuelan Prisons Observatory
May 1 2013
APT has joined the World Organization against Torture (OMCT) and the International Federation of Human Rights in urging Venezuelan authorities to take measures to ensure the safety of Venezuelan Prisons Observatory members.In a press release targeted at the Venezuelan authorities we expressed our deep concern about recent threats made against the Venezuelan Prisons Observatory's legal coordinator.Similarly, we condemn the ongoing smear campaign against the Prison Observatory and its members, which impedes and undermines the valuable work being done on behalf of the rights of persons deprived of liberty in Venezuela.
