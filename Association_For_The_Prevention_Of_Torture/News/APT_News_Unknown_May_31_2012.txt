May 31 2012
How does the triangular working relationship between the Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture, the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and the National Preventive Mechanisms established under the OPCAT work with regard to inspection in the field of detention on a global, regional and domestic level?This will be explored on Friday 1 June 2012 when the Inspectorate of Security and Justice in the Netherlands – recently coordinating the national preventive mechanism in the country – and the VU University of Amsterdam are convening an international conference. The meeting will take place in the penitentiary institution Nieuwersluis, in the Netherlands, and will bring together a wide range of international, regional and national experts on torture prevention. The APT will moderate a panel discussion on the synergies between the international and European torture prevention bodies. This will represent an ideal opportunity to follow-up on the discussions held on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture, where similar topics were debated.Conference Programme
