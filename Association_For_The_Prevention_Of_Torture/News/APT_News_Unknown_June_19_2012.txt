Busy agenda for the Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture
June 19 2012
In April 2012, a delegation of four experts from the UN Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture (SPT) visited Honduras for the second time. Two years and a half after their first visit the SPT now focused on the situation of the National Preventive Mechanism. This was the first time the SPT carried out joint visits to places of detention with an NPM, in order to assess its needs and better understand its working methods. The APT welcomes this initiative and hopes that this methodology will be fully integrated in the future SPT visits focusing on NPMs.In the coming months, the SPT will for the first time visit Kyrgyzstan (18-29 September 2012), a country which ratified the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention on Torture in December 2008. It is hoped that the SPT visit will follow-up on some recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur on Torture in December 2011 (link to report) and accelerate the process to establish an effective National Preventive Mechanism (NPM). The APT was informed that the NPM legislation was adopted in its third and final reading by the Kyrgyz Parliament in June 2012.

The next SPT visit, focusing on National Preventive Mechanisms, will take place in Moldova (1-4 October 2012). During its visit the SPT will have to face some challenges regarding the lack of clarity of the designated NPM. The legislation in Moldova has raised questions and lead to different interpretations of the nature of the NPM. Further information on Kyrgyzstan and Moldova is available in the APT OPCAT Database and in the Atlas of Torture projectâ€™s report.
