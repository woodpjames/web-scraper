On 16 December the APT and its partner, the Civil Society Institute, organized a workshop for judges, prosecutors and defence lawyers on the prevention and investigation of torture using the Armenian translation of the University of Essexâ€™s publication, 'Combating Torture: A Manual for Judges and Prosecutors'. This new version of the publication was officially launched on the day and has subsequently been actively distributed among a range of relevant actors throughout the country.
