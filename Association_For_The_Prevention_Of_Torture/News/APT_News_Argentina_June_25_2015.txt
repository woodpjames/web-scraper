Argentina should take historic step for the prevention of torture
June 25 2015
Despite having ratified the international torture prevention treaty (OPCAT) in 2004, Argentina has still not taken the necessary steps to implement it effectively and to put an end to human rights violations in places of detention.In a public statement, the APT urges the Argentinian government to promptly select the members of the future National Committee for Prevention of Torture. By doing this, Argentina would comply with its obligations under the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention against Torture, and establish the National System for Prevention of Torture created by law in 2013.
