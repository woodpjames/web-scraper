Civil society organisations call for Guantánamo closure
January 25 2016
The APT has joined a group of 59 organisations to urge the US government to close down the detention centre, opened 14 years ago at the US naval base of Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. Guantánamo is “a global symbol of lawlessness and injustice” and “a false solution to the terrorist threat”, the organisations say.In the last 14 years, almost 780 men and even boys were held in Guantánamo. Today, 91 prisoners remain in the centre.In a recent report, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights described the abuses – including torture and ill-treatment, indefinite detention, limited or no access to judicial protection, and absence of basic elements of due process.In the joint statement, the 59 organisations, echoing the recent call by the Commission, urge the US government to shut down the centre, appropriately prosecute those responsible for human rights violations, and ensure effective redress for victims.Read the statement in English, Portuguese or Spanish.
