Excessive use of pre-trial detention in the EU
September 10 2013
The APT today co-signed a letter sent to European Commission Vice-President Viviane Reding, urging the Commission to take steps aimed at reducing the excessive periods of time people spend in pre-trial detention and to increase the use of alternatives.Across the European Union both the use and material conditions of pre-trial detention vary considerably and can have a very detrimental impact on persons deprived of their liberty. Among other issues, the letter calls on the Commission to take concrete steps to establish minimum and enforceable EU standards on pre-trial detention.The letter is co-signed by 22 NGOs and has been copied to various relevant European Commission actors.
