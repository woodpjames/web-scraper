NPM Establishment in Lebanon
January 10 2011
The APT participated in a workshop on OPCAT implementation and torture prevention on 25 November 2010. The event was organized by the NGOs Restart and ALEF and attended by the main stakeholders involved in torture prevention in Lebanon.A substantial part of the day was dedicated to discussing the two draft laws currently on the table to establish a National Preventive Mechanisms (NPM) to implement Lebanon’s obligation under the OPCAT (see OPCAT Database). The APT provided comments on the two options. The workshop was timely, as the Lebanese government has reiterated its comment to establish the NPM in front of the Human Rights Council’s Periodic Review Process earlier that month, following the appreciation and encouragement it has received from a range of States for its adherence to the OPCAT.
