Benin: Supporting the Implementation of the Convention against Torture and its Optional Protocol
September 18 2008
An APT delegation visited Benin from 24 to 29 August to support the implementation process of the Convention against Torture and its Optional Protocol. The APT and the Ministry of Justice organised a national seminar on the follow-up to the concluding observations of the CAT on the second periodic report of Benin. The seminar analyzed the concluding observations and adopted a roadmap on the way forward towards implementation of the Convention. The APT and the Ministry of Justice met with the follow-up Working Group designated by the seminar. They drafted a proposal to amend respectively the draft penal code and the draft penal procedure code currently under review. This proposal will be submitted by the Ministry of Justice to the Chair of the Parliamentary Commission on Legislation for consideration.
