A.B. v Russia
October 20 2010
On 14 October the European Court also found in the case of A.B. v Russia two violations of Article 3, the first as a result of the complainant being held in solitary confinement for at least three years. The Court stated that the authorities had made no attempt to justify his protracted and repeatedly extended detention, nor to assess his physical or psychological aptitude for it. In addition, the Court ruled that the man had been subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment as a result of the failure of the authorities to provide him with the minimum medical supervision for the timely treatment of his HIV infection while in detention over a period of six years.
