Since then States have been working at the General Assembly in New York to consider whether and how the High Commissioners recommendations might be achieved. Yet after a year of negotiations, States continue to argue over how money can be saved and what the concrete gains to treaty bodies would be. Some States have even promoted measures which significantly weaken the treaty body system.Comments made by the High Commissioner in 2012 left States in no doubt that the treaty body system is in trouble. As the number of States and workload has grown while the available resources have shrunk, treaty bodies are no longer able to deliver their important mandate.

Some recommendations even seek to achieve cost savings.Civil society organisations have promoted seven key objectives that risk being ignored by the current negotiations. Together with other NGOs, the APT urges States to ensure adequate time is given to promote:The full statement is available here.
