APT welcomes its first Asia Pacific Fellow
August 8 2013
Sawadee-ka! The APT has welcomed its first Geneva-based Fellow, Ms Pornpen Khongkachonkiet (Noinoi), who is the Director of the Cross Cultural Foundation – one of APT’s major partners in Thailand.Pornpen Khongkachonkiet will be a Fellow with the Asia Pacific programme for six months, working on prevention of torture issues, particularly in the ASEAN region. The purpose of the Fellowship is to strengthen the partnership between the two organisations and the advocacy for torture prevention in Thailand. This Fellowship is particularly timely given that Thailand will be in the international spotlight in 2014, with a visit from the Special Rapporteur on Torture scheduled for February and a state review by the Committee against Torture due in May. With Pornpen’s assistance, the APT has already contributed to parliamentary hearings on reform of the Thai Criminal Code to include torture and we are calling on Thailand to ratify the OPCAT at the UN Treaty event in September.Ms Pornpen Khongkachonkiet's profile can be found here
