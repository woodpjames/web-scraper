May 9 2012
APT Secretary General, Mark Thomson, called on the remaining 14 OSCE States to join the global system to prevent the persistent and pervasive pandemic of torture, at an OSCE ministerial Human Dimension Committee in Vienna on 9 May. The OSCE should intensify its efforts and request its human rights body, the ODIHR, to reactivate its torture prevention work.The APT proposes that OSCE foster cross regional cooperation between States and National Preventive Mechanisms to encourage cooperation and follow up to recommendations made by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT) and the UN Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture (SPT). The OSCE, with its field presence, could play an important role to assist States and preventive mechanisms, as well as in helping regional UN bodies to improve and coordinate their interaction with national actors.From pledges to action on torture prevention in the OSCE - Presentation of Mark Thomson, Secretary General, APT
