Australia moves closer to OPCAT ratification
March 26 2012
On 28 February 2012, Australia moved a step closer to ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention Against Torture (OPCAT), with the federal Government tabling a National Interest Analysis (NIA) proposing ratification."Torture is wholly inconsistent with the Australian Government’s fundamental responsibility to protect the rights and dignity of all individuals… Ratifying OPCAT will send a strong message both within Australia and internationally that Australia takes its human rights obligations seriously", Australian Attorney-General Nicola Roxon said.The NIA will be considered by the Federal Parliament’s Joint Standing Committee on Treaties (JSCOT), which is inviting interested individuals and groups to make a submission before 30 March 2012.
