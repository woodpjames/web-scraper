Time for Ghana to ratify torture prevention treaty
March 18 2013
On Thursday March 14, APT encouraged Ghana to ratify OPCAT by year-end in an oral statement presented in the UN Human Rights Council during the adoption of the final outcome of its Universal Periodic Review (UPR).In the statement we emphasized our belief that Ghana has the potential to become a leader in torture prevention if it establishes an independent, effective and well-resourced national preventive mechanism.What is UPR? Universal Periodic Review (UPR) is a process in which the human rights record of every United Nations Member State is reviewed by other States. Each State is reviewed once every four years. Every Member State participated in the first cycle (2008-2011) and now the second cycle (2012-2016) is underway. The APT advocates for States to make UPR recommendations to other States on torture prevention. In addition, we make oral statements when the final outcome of the review is adopted by the UN Human Rights Council, which is the only opportunity for NGOs to speak on the floor of the Human Rights Council during the entire UPR process.
