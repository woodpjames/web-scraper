Support for Mexico's Prevention Body
August 10 2009
The APT was pleased to be able to lend its support to the National Preventive Mechanism (NPM) of Mexico for its work in the prevention of torture and other ill-treatment.An internal workshop took place in Mexico City from 4 to 6 August, with all 30 staff of the NPM, and reviewed the functioning of the NPM and considered ways of increasing its effectiveness. The NPM has identified around 5,000 places of detention which they should visit.The APT facilitated an internal analysis that covers all aspects of the work and functioning of an NPM: internal organisation, resources, outputs, relations with external actors and working methods. Through this process of reflection the members of the Mexican NPM were able to agree on 16 actions that could strengthen their impact.{gallery}mex09{/gallery}
