Scottish Custody Visiting Conference
September 9 2009
Around 100 delegates attended the exchange where they learnt more about the United Kingdom's (UK) obligations under the instrument, which the country ratified in late 2003. The Independent Custody Visiting Association, which is a voluntary organization that promotes the custody visiting process in the UK, is one of 18 bodies that have been designated as the country's NPM. As Independent Custody Visitors in the eight Scottish regions of Central, Dumfries & Galloway, Fife, Grampian, Lothian & Borders, Northern, Tayside and Strathclyde the participants have a crucial role to play in implementing the UK's obligations in practice relating to the independent monitoring of places of police detention in Scotland.In addition to the discussion on the OPCAT, the audience heard some fascinating presentations on a range of other subjects such as the recently initiated joint monitoring of police detention facilities by Her Majesty's Inspectorates of Prisons and Constabulary for England and Wales and the experience of custody visiting in Northern Ireland. The Chief Inspector of Strathclyde Police, Stephen Noble, also contextualized custody visiting within the day-to-day operational work of police detention facilities. The APT is grateful to the organizers for the opportunity to participate in this interesting exchange.
