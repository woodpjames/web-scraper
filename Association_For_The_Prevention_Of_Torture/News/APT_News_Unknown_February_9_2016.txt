African anti-torture committee CPTA reaffirms the right to redress
February 9 2016
The Committee for the Prevention of Torture in Africa (CPTA) is developing a General Comment on the Right to Redress for Victims of Torture or Ill-treatment under Article 5 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights.To finalise the first draft, the CPTA convened a meeting in Cape Town, South Africa, 1-3 February 2016. APT’s Jean-Baptiste Niyizurugero, vice-chairperson of the CPTA, participated in the meeting together with other member of the Committee and experts from various human rights institutions and civil society organisations.This drafting retreat, convened by the CPTA, followed a series of preparatory meetings, including a technical meeting in Accra, Ghana, in July 2015, and a consultation meeting in Johannesburg, South Africa, in October 2015. These earlier meetings provided the CPTA with detailed insight into the legal, practical and political challenges that currently prevent victims of torture or ill-treatment from obtaining redress. The outcomes of these meetings served as a basis for discussions during the drafting retreat.The CPTA will now be able to present a “zero draft” of the General Comment. The draft will be published on the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights website for further inputs from the general public.
