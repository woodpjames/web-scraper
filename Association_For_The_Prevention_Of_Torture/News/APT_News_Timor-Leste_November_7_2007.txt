Promoting the Optional Protocol in Timor-Leste
November 7 2007
From 14 to 21 November, the APT carried out its very first mission to Timor-Leste, to conduct a needs assessment of national institutions involved in promoting and protecting the rights of people deprived of their liberty. In addition to defining how it could best assist those actors to carry out their detention related activities, the APT used this opportunity to discuss with policy-makers the prospects of ratification and implementation of the OPCAT, which Timor-Leste signed in September 2005.This was the APT's first visit to Timor-Leste.The PDHJ was the most recent NHRI to join the Asia-Pacific Forum for NHRIs.The APT will be organising a training session for the PDHJ and NGOs on the methodology of visits to places of detention in the course of 2008. The APF has already indicated its willingness to support such a project.The APT is considering providing the Timorese government with expertise on the setting up of a National Preventive Mechanism under the OPCAT.
