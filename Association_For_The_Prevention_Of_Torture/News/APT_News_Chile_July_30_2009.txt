Chile: The designation of a National Preventive Mechanism
July 30 2009
Chile ratified the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention against Torture on 12 December 2008, thus acquiring the international obligation to designate its National Preventive Mechanism (NPM) by January 2010. The APT visited Chile from 4 to 7 August to take part in a national seminar covering general aspects of the OPCAT, the requirements of the NPM and the specific implications of the international treaty for Chile.A one day national seminar took place on 7 August in Santiago de Chile. The seminar was co-organized by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Justice and the APT, under the auspices of the University of Chile and the University Diego Portales. Approximately 100 representatives of the government, parliament, the judiciary and civil society participated in the seminar. The three panels covered general aspects of the OPCAT, the requirements of the NPM and the specific implications of the international treaty for Chile. Respected international jurists, Marco Mona (former President of the APT) and Wilder Tayler (member of the UN Subcommittee on Torture) participated in the discussions.Prior to the seminar, the invited international experts joined APT representatives in meetings with key national authorities, legislators and civil society representatives to promote the designation of the NPM, particularly in light of the consideration by Congress of the draft bill to create a National Human Rights Institution, which may be appointed as NPM.
