Fruitful exchange with the Protector of Human Rights and Freedoms of Montenegro
April 13 2017
On 11 and 12 April 2017, the APT received a visit from the Protector of Human Rights and Freedoms of Montenegro, the two Deputy Protectors and four staff of the ombuds institution. The Office of the Protector has been working as National Preventive Mechanism (NPM) under the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention against Torture (OPCAT) since the end of 2012.During the two-day visit, the representatives of the Protectorâ€™s Office met with the Secretary General and Chief of Operations of the APT, as well as several members of our staff who addressed key aspects of the work of an NPM, using good practice examples from other similar institutions.The sessions focused on the various working methods used by NPMs worldwide, including on visiting places of detention and ensuring follow-up on recommendations; tackled specific issues such as monitoring safeguards to prevent torture and addressing vulnerabilities in detention; and concluded on the different ways NPMs can communicate about their activities. The working meeting was an excellent opportunity for both institutions to gain first-hand information about their respective work on torture prevention.Carried out with the support of the Council of Europe (CoE) as part of the joint CoE/EU PREDIM project aiming at supporting national institutions in preventing discrimination in Montenegro, the visit resulted in very fruitful exchanges between the APT and the Office of the Protector and contributed to reinforce our cooperation.
