Monitoring Places of Detention in Mongolia
December 16 2008
The APT returned to the Mongolian capital, Ulaanbaatar, from 16 - 19 December, in order to complete a nine-month training project aimed at promoting independent detention monitoring in the country. The project, which was co-organized by Amnesty International (AI) Mongolia and the APT aimed to train around 25 NGO representatives on how to effectively monitoring closed institutions such as prisons and police stations.For this purpose the organizations held an initial three-day workshop in Ulaanbaatar from 10-12 April 2008, which included a visit to Ulaanbaatar's prison for women. Since then the NGO representatives have been visiting five different detention facilities in and around Ulaanbaatar on a regular basis and, in doing so, have accumulated a significant amount of experience monitoring closed institutions.The December 2008 visit to the country included a two-day training workshop for the project participants, which aimed to build on what was learned during the first event. The structure of the second training event was designed around the stated needs of the participants and, in particular, focused on report writing, formulating effective recommendations, key international standards and establishing durable relationships with prisoners and the prison authorities.The workshops represented the first ever training for NGO representatives on independent detention monitoring in Mongolia.AI Mongolia has translated into Mongolian the APT publication, Monitoring places of detention: a practical guide for NGOs.AgendaMonitoring Places of Detention: NGO Guide - MongolianÂ  Other Languages
