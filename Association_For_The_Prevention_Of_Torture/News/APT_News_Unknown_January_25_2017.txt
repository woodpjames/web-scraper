Sir Nigel Rodley passes away: the loss of a leading human rights advocate
January 25 2017
It is with great sadness that the APT has heard of the loss of a leading human rights figure and close friend Sir Nigel Rodley. After a short illness, Sir Nigel died early this morning in Colchester, England.Over the last thirty years Sir Nigel has been one of the most influential persons in the global advocacy to prevent and prohibit all acts of torture. As the Head of Amnesty International's Legal Office he successfully advocated for the UN Convention against Torture, its Optional Protocol and the creation of a UN Special Rapporteur on Torture - a mandate which he later, from 1993, held himself. Many of his recommendations have provided real protection from torture and have saved lives. His report on Brazil remains, for example, the reference document for detention related reforms over the last 15 years.On behalf of the APT, Secretary General Mark Thomson has responded to Sir Nigel's sudden passing:"Let us not only mourn the loss of our dear friend and inspirational mentor. Let us also carry forward together the struggle for justice that Nigel so profoundly defended with such rigour and impressive effect".
