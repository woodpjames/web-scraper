European Conference of the International Ombudsman Institute
December 9 2010
The APT was invited to participate in the 2010 European Conference of the International Ombudsman Institute. One of the themes for discussions between these European National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs) was the Optional Protocol to the UN convention against Torture (OPCAT) and the role of NHRIs in the implementation of OPCAT. This is a particularly important topic as many European NHRIs have been designated as National Preventive Mechanisms (NPMs) under the OPCAT.
