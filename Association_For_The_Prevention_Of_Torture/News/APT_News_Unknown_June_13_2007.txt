UK House of Lords decision on Rights of Civilian Detainees Abroad
June 13 2007
In its ruling today in the case of Al Skeini and others, the UK House of Lords decided that the UK was obliged to conduct an independent investigation into the death of Baha Mousa, who died after sustaining 93 separate injuries while under detention by British forces in Basra, Iraq, in 2003. In a four-to-one verdict, the lords ruled that the UK's obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights applied to the conduct of British troops in Iraq. They upheld a court of appeal ruling of December 2005 that the UK authorities had "extra-territorial jurisdiction" concerning Mr Mousa, a 26-year-old hotel worker.The judgement in full (PDF)
