From 30 November to 4 December 2009, the APT was in Jakarta to continue its activities in support of OPCAT ratification and implementation in Indonesia, in cooperation with local partners ELSAM and Komnas HAM. The APT has been engaged in torture prevention work in Indonesia for a number of years and jointly held the first roundtable discussion on the OPCAT with its local partners in November 2008. A national consultation on the future National Preventive Mechanism (NPM) was subsequently held in February 2009.During this trip, the APT and its partners held a roundtable discussion with state and NGO representatives to build on this progress by facilitating discussions on the standards for the NPM in Indonesia and options for the organisation and structure of that body. The organisations also launched the Essex publication 'Combating Torture: A Manual for Judges and Prosecutors' in Bahasa Indonesia, in preparation for work on torture prevention with members of these professions in 2010.ELSAMKomnas HAMAPT Briefing NoteThe Essex publication Combating Torture: A Manual for Judges and Prosecutors (Bahasa Indonesia) was launched.The APT's OPCAT Frequently Asked Questions was translated into Bahasa Indonesia and was distributed among participants of the roundtable.Jem Stevens, APT Asia-Pacific Programme OfficerAudrey Olivier, APT OPCAT Coordinator
