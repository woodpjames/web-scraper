African NHRIs discuss training of public officials
November 25 2014
Representatives of National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs) from nineteen African countries met in Yaoundé, Cameroon, 17 — 18 November 2014, to attend a two-day workshop on "The role of NHRIs in Training Public Officials”.Through lectures, discussions and group exercises, the workshop sought to help NHRIs to identify when training public officials can be part of an effective torture prevention strategy. Participants shared experiences and good practices on direct training, on training of trainers and on curriculum development, over the two-days of the event.The face-to-face workshop was preceded, in October 2014, by a two-week online course and discussion forum. The event in Yaoundé then allowed participants to deepen their knowledge and understanding of the different options available to them with regards to law enforcement training.This event is part of a three-year project initiated by the APT and the Network of African National Institutions of Human Rights (NANHRI), entitled "A continent United against Torture". The main objective of the project is to strengthen the institutional capacities of NHRIs to prevent torture in Africa.The project is funded by the European Union. The Yaoundé event was co-hosted by The National Commission on Human Rights and Freedoms of Cameroon (NCHRF).
