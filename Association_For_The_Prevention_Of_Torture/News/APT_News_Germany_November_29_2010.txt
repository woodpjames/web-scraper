Hellig v Germany
November 29 2010
On 7 July the European Court ruled in the case of Hellig v Germany that the later had violated Article 3 of the Convention. The man, Herbert Hellig, complained that he had been held naked in a security cell in Butzbach prison in October 2000 for one week.The Court concluded that, while the seven-day placement in the security cell as such might have been justified by the particular circumstances of the case, there had not been sufficient reasons which could justify such harsh treatment, namely depriving the man of his clothes, in violation of Article 3.Click to access the ECHR case law database
