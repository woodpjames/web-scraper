Panama becomes the 10th Latin American State to adopt NPM law
March 14 2017
In February 2017, the law creating a National Preventive Mechanism attached to the Panama Ombudsperson’s Office entered into force. Since 2015, the Sub-Commission in charge of establishing the NPM, under the leadership of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, met repeatedly to identify the NPM options and to draft a proposal.The promulgation of the NPM law is welcome and timely for Panama as, in July 2017, Panama’s report will be reviewed by the Committee against Torture. Furthermore, in the second semester of 2017, Panama will receive a visit of the UN Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture. Out of the 15 States parties to the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture (OPCAT) in Latin America, Panama becomes the 10th state to adopt an NPM legislation.Over the years, the APT has supported the NPM establishment process, through direct advice and facilitation of external expertise. Together with our partners, we remain committed to support the next phase of OPCAT implementation in Panama, including drafting of a decree of implementation of the law and NPM functioning.
