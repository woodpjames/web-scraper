'No one knows about us' - Join the campaign for the UN torture prevention treaty (OPCAT)This film by Lebanese filmmaker Carol Mansour gives a voice to torture survivors and to activists struggling to prevent these horrible violations of human dignity. In 2002 the United Nations adopted an international torture prevention agreement that opens detention doors to human rights, the "OPCAT". The film, produced by the Association for the Prevention of Torture (APT), encourages viewers to call upon their authorities to ratify the treaty and to prevent torture and ill-treatment before they happen.
