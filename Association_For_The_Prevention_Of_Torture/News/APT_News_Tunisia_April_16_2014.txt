Launch of police monitoring guide with Tunisian Ministry of Interior
April 16 2014
High level ministry officials, officers, NGOs, the press and the diplomatic community today joined the APT and the Ministry of Interior at a joint event in Tunis to launch the Arabic version of APT’s publication Monitoring Police Custody – a practical guide.The organisation of the event, at the Ministry of Interior of Tunisia, is a demonstration of the political will of the Tunisian authorities to enter into a constructive dialogue with the new National Preventive Mechanism, which Tunisia is about to establish. The APT’s founder Jean-Jacques Gautier was right when he predicted, some 40 years ago, that one day States will allow independent monitoring: “When a country that suffers from a too brutal police will change the regime, we can legitimately expect its government to want to immediately join the 'club of countries whose human rights bill is clean'”, he wrote. This is exactly what Tunisia did, by ratifying the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention against Torture immediately after the January 2011 revolution.

The launch event was followed by a two-day training course for police officers on how to receive monitoring visits, including the exchange of experience with Swiss and Lebanese experts and the International Committee of the Red Cross.
