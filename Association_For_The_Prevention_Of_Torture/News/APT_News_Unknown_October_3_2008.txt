October 3 2008
OSCE Project Coordinator in UkraineMinistry of Internal Affairs of UkraineKharkiv Institute for Social ResearchIndependent Custody Visiting AssociationIt is hoped that as a result of the exchange there is now greater awareness among the participants of the concept and the need for independent monitoring of all places of detention in Ukraine. Although there exist various monitoring bodies in the country, it is still not known which type of body will be designated or established as the National Preventive Mechanism (NPM) under the OPCAT in the country. Ukraine ratified the instrument in September 2006 and therefore should have put in place its NPM by September 2007. It is therefore hoped that the event provided greater stimulus for the conclusion of this all-important process.AgendaOSCE Press Release of the Event
