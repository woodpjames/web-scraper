Canada and the ratification of the Optional Protocol
June 8 2007
Canada has always supported the OPCAT, and has played an active role within the Working Group which spent many years drafting the text of the OPCAT. The ratification has been delayed because of a volatile political context in Ottawa, where two minority governments were elected between 2004 and 2006.  The Liberal and Conservative governments have made a number of declarations to the effect that discussions between relevant departments, as well as with the provinces and territories which comprise the Federation were underway.The OPCAT Campaign in Canada is run in co-operation with the local section of Amnesty International and the Canadian Association of Elizabeth Fry Societies.Hearing of the Subcommittee on International Human Rights of Canada - English  French
