Benin: the establishment of an effective NPM
July 18 2007
A national seminar was organized jointly by the APT and the Ministry of Justice on the establishment of an effective NPM. The seminar gathered about 30 national key actors including representatives from the Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Police, Judiciary and Penitentiary Services as well as NGOs. This inclusive consultation reviewed the obligations and implications of the OPCAT and assessed the current national situation in Benin (current visiting mechanisms in place, gaps, needsâ€¦) and came up with a range of recommendations which will serve as a 'roadmap' to guide the authorities in establishing an effective NPM.The APT also met with the Head of the UNDP-Benin, the Head of the Swiss Cooperation Agency as well as the Human Rights Officer of the Danish Embassy to exchange views and share information on OPCAT implementation process for possible cooperation in this area.APT delegation with UNDP Representative and Ministry of Justice OfficialsAPT Africa Programme Officer and the Benin Minister of Justice at the meeting of the Working Group on the NPM establishment
