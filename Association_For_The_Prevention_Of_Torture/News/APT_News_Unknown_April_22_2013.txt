Focus on torture prevention for African human rights institutions
April 22 2013
Torture and ill-treatment is still a widespread problem in most parts of the African continent â€“ and perpetrators often go unpunished.APT, together with the Network of African National Human Rights Institutions, has recently launched a 3-year project to strengthen the role of African NHRIs in the prevention of torture. The first training, focusing on investigation of allegations of torture, takes place in Johannesburg 23-24 April, gathering representatives of national human rights institutions from more than 30 countries.Read more about the projectRead the press releaseConcept noteAgendaList of participants
