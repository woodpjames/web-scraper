Central America: Promoting OPCAT Ratification and Implementation
July 28 2009
A national campaign to promote OPCAT ratification in Panama – one of the few countries in Latin America not to have ratified – is being carried out by the Ombudspersons Office (Defensoría del Pueblo) of Panama. In this context, the institution is promoting debate about the issue within the Ombudspersons Office Network of Central America (Consejo Centroamericano de Procuradores de Derechos Humanos). In Central America, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua have already ratified the OPCAT and the Ombudspersons Offices have a role to play in implementation, whether they are part of the National Preventive Mechanism (as in Costa Rica) or to collaborate with a new institution (as in Honduras).General purpose:Specific objectives:The APT has been invited to participate as a panelist in a two day seminar entitled 'Regional Seminar on the Human Rights of Persons Deprived of Liberty: Reflections about the Implications of OPCAT Ratification and Implementation'.
