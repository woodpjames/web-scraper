June 21 2018
From 26 May to 01 June 2018, an APT delegation visited Madagascar to kick-off a three-year project on the implementation of basic procedurals safeguards to prevent torture during the first hours of deprivation of liberty. The project aims at supporting the police in effectively implementing three key safeguards – namely informing arrested persons on their rights and reason for detention in a language they understand; notifying a relative of the arrest; and keeping a register, in each place of detention, detailing information such as date, time and reason for detention for each person deprived of liberty. The launch of the project was also the opportunity to organise a national seminar on the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention against Torture (OPCAT) system and strengthen national actors’ knowledge on the mandate of a National Preventive Mechanism (NPM). After ratifying the OPCAT in September last year, Madagascar is close to establishing its NPM.In practice, the launch of this three year-project project consisted in:“I am fully available to collaborate with you for the successful implementation of the project,” said the Principal Commissioner of Police and Antananarivo’s Head of Police, Tsaramonina Ravony. “I look forward to seeing the benefits of this project in our pilot police stations, and to furthering the protection of persons deprived of liberty with all actors concerned by the prevention of torture in the country.”The APT is now in possession of all the information necessary to provide adequate support through tailored measures and tools to be tested in the four pilot police stations before their extension to the whole country in the second phase of the project.NPM DesignationThe APT also took the opportunity of its visit to organise a national seminar on the OPCAT, which Madagascar ratified in September 2017.
