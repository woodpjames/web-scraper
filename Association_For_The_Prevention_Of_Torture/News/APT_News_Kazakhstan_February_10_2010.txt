Various organizations, including Penal Reform International's Office for Central Asia, co-sponsored this exchange in the Kazakh capital, Astana, on 15-16 February 2010, which was attended by more than 100 persons. For the very first time in Kazakhstan this type of event was attended by members of the UN Subcommittee on Prevention, Dr Marija Definis-Gojanovic and Dr Zdenek Hajek.During the event national and international actors analyzed a proposal by the Ministry of Justice to put in place an NPM. An inter-ministerial working group spear-headed by the Ministry of Justice has proposed that the country's civil society-comprised Public Monitoring Commissions be designated as the NPM. Public Monitoring Commissions operate in all 14 of Kazakhstan's oblasts (administrative areas) as well as in the cities of Almaty and Astana. The working group argued that through a process of legislative change these Public Monitoring Commissions could be put on an OPCAT compliant footing. Amendments would have to be made to a welter of existing laws to achieve such change.Various civil society actors expressed concern about this proposal due to its various shortcomings in the light of the minimum requirements of the OPCAT text. The many shortcomings of the NPM proposal became immediately apparent during the event. The APT attended this important exchange and contributed to the discussion. The event represented just one of several such meetings which have taken place in recent years, in which the organization has participated.
