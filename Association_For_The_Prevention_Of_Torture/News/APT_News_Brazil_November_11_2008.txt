Detention Monitoring in Brazil
November 11 2008
On 10 November, the APT held a four-day workshop on Detention Monitoring in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. This workshop, the third of its kind in Brasil, forms part of a Memorandum of Understanding signed by the APT with the Brasilian Secretary for Human Rights. The 44 participants, mainly comprising prosecution offices, civil society and judges, represented 13 different states in Brasil. The workshop, aimed at strenghtening practical skills regarding detention monitoring, also constituted an opportunity to discuss the draft law on the creation of the National Preventive Mechanism in Brasil. Those attending had the opportunity to carry out a visit to four different types of places of detention: a pre-trial prison, a center for minors, a prison for women and a psychiatric hospital.{gallery}brazil1108{/gallery}
