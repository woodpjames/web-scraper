Slyusarev v. Russia
April 20 2010
On 20 April 2010 the European Court found a violation of Article 3 in the case of Slyusarev v. Russia. The man, who suffers from severe short-sightedness, was arrested by police in Moscow in 1998 and was held in pre-trial detention, during which his damaged glasses were taken away from him for five months. The authorities then took another further two months to repair the said item. Given the degree of the applicantâ€™s suffering and its duration caused by his inability to read or write, the Court concluded that the applicant had been subjected to degrading treatment.Click  to access the ECHR case law database
