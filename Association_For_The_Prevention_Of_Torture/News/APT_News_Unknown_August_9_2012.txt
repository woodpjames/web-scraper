After their performance a documentary film was screened. "El Porvenir" describes the tragedy of the prison El Porvenir, in Honduras, where 69 inmates lost their lives, and the persistent struggle of the families demanding justice. At the end of the night, the mother of an inmate detained at a Panamanian prison, shared the difficulties and mistreatment that her son and herself have been subjected to since his arrest, bringing the participants closer to the reality of the country’s penitentiary system.
