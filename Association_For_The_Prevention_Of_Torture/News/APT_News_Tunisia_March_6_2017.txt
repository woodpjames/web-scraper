During this week, the Tunisian delegation met and exchanged experiences with the Swiss National Commission for the Prevention of Torture and with the UN Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture.The visit also resulted in fruitful exchanges between NPM members and the UN Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, as well as with the Human Security Division of the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs, which also funded the study visit as part of a programme for cooperation and support in the Middle East and North Africa region between the FDFA And the APT and OMCT.Read more (French)Interview with Hamida Dridi, President of the National Authority for the Prevention of Torture in Tunisia (Arabic with French subtitles)
