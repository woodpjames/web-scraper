Ivan Kuzmin v. Russia
November 29 2010
On 25 November the European Court found two violations of Article 3 of the ECHR in the case of Ivan Kuzmin v. Russia. The complainant, a school sports teacher from Stavropol, alleged that he had been taken into police custody and beaten by police officers in June 2001. The Court ruled both that the authorities had failed to effectively investigate his complaint and that it had been proven beyond reasonable doubt that the man had been ill-treated by the police officers. As the latter had failed to document the fact of deprivation of liberty, the Court also found that a grave violation of manâ€™s right to liberty and security had taken place in contravention of Article 5 of the ECHR.
