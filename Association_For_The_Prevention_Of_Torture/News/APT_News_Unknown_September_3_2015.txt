Fight against torture a priority in new EU Action Plan
September 3 2015
The fight against torture has been given priority in the new EU Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy, adopted this summer by the Council of the European Union.This Action Plan, to guide the EUâ€™s external action 2015-2019, has made combatting torture, ill-treatment and the death penalty one of the seven human rights challenges it commits to address.The APT welcomes the emphasis in the Action Plan and calls on the EU to effectively implement the planned activities. The EU should also carry out the necessary monitoring and evaluation of actions taken, to more efficiently prevent and combat torture worldwide.The APT, together with other NGOs within the Brussels-based Human Rights and Democracy Network, are also advocating for the EU to establish a strategy on the protection of human rights within the EU. The European Parliament will soon examine a report on the situation of fundamental rights in the European Union in 2013-2014.The report provides a broad picture of the human rights challenges that Europe is facing and further calls on the adoption of an internal fundamental rights strategy by the European Commission. The Human Rights and Democracy Network therefore calls on all members of the European Parliament to support this report and secure its adoption, without any amendment curtailing its scope or watering down its substance.
