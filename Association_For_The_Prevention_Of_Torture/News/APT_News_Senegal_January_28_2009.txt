The joint APT/AIS delegation suggested substantial amendments to be incorporated in the draft law. Both organizations submitted a joint document to Parliament and to the Ministry of Justice where they proposed inter alia the following amendments to improve the quality of the draft law in line with the OPCAT criteria: to change the title of the foreseen NPM from 'Observatory for Places of Deprivation of Liberty' to 'Inspector General of Places of Deprivation of Liberty'; to integrate the idea of continuity of the NPM staff and sustainability of the institution; to lift the restriction of NPM visits in cases of urgent grounds; and to ensure guarantees for financial independence and access to information. All interlocutors were receptive to the AIS/APT proposed amendments.On 16 January 2009, a briefing meeting was organized for civil society organizations to update them on the ongoing lobbying and advocacy process. It was agreed that civil society should remain vigilant in the adoption of an NPM law in compliance with the OPCAT provisions. It was also suggested that once the law is adopted, that the APT and AIS should be ready to propose a draft decree on the implementation of this law (d√©cret d'application) - as that stage is also important in the Senegalese law system.
