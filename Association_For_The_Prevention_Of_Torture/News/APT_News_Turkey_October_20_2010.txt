Kurkaev v. Turkey
October 20 2010
On 19 October in the case of Kurkaev v. Turkey ruled that the complainant had been subjected to degrading treatment owing to the conditions of detention of the applicant at the Foreigners' Department of the Istanbul Security Headquarters, where he was held for 91 days. The Court found that in particular the serious overcrowding and absence of adequate sleeping facilities, combined with the lack of access to open air and the inordinate length of the period during which he was detained in such conditions, went beyond the threshold of severity under Article 3 of the Convention and amounted to degrading treatment.
