Critical, but constructive report on Moldova’s NPM
March 15 2013
The National Preventive Mechanism of Moldova has published the report of the 2012 visit by the Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture, aimed at strengthening the NPM. The UN expert body recommends key legislative and organizational changes.Following its NPM advisory visit to Moldova in October 2012, the SPT drafted two reports, one addressed to the State and one to the NPM. The NPM has just published the latter report, and translated it into Moldovan.After nearly five years of operating as an NPM the visit by the UN expert body was a timely moment to take stock of the mechanism’s strengths and weaknesses.One of the main obstacles hindering the efficiency of the NPM is the legal ambiguity regarding which domestic mechanism constitutes the NPM. At present there exist competing interpretations whether the Centre for Human Rights (Ombudsman’s Office) and/or the civil society comprised Consultative Council fulfils this role. The SPT submitted recommendations to address this issue and commented also on the current draft law that provides opportunity for real improvement in this regard.To build the capacity and reinforce the mandate of the NPM the SPT recommended the following:The APT wholeheartedly welcomes the move of the NPM to publish the SPT’s report, which casts a critical, albeit constructive eye over its functioning in practice. The organisation urges the NPM and the relevant authorities to act on the key recommendations contained in the report.
