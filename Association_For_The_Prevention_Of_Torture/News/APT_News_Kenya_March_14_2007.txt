Promoting the Optional Protocol in Kenya
March 14 2007
From 6 to 8 March 2007 an APT delegation visited Kenya to promote ratification and implementation of the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention against Torture (OPCAT). Beyond the ratification of the OPCAT and the establishment and functioning of the National Preventive Mechanism (NPM), the delegation assessed how the APT could assist national actors in other areas that can contribute to the prevention of torture, such as: training on detention monitoring, strengthening judicial guarantees and capacities; as well as preparation of reports for the Committee against Torture.The delegation, comprising the APT Secretary general, Africa Programme Officer and OPCAT Coordinator, met with a variety of national actors including the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights (KNCHR), the Legal Resources Foundation, the Independent Medico Legal Unit (IMLU), the Institute for Education in Democracy, the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ - Kenya) and the Attorney General.Some relevant documents:Some relevant links:
