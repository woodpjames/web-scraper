New committees on torture prevention in Honduras
July 22 2015
The Honduran National Preventive Mechanism CONAPREV has launched a new initiative to set up local committees on torture prevention. These committees will extend the geographic scope of the NPM’s work.With the support of the local government, El Progreso was the first municipality to create a committee, which will be visiting places of detention regularly, under the CONAPREV´s supervision. The committee is comprised of a multidisciplinary team with different expertise; lawyers, psychologists, social workers etc. The local Councillor is the current President of the committee.“The wide extend of their mandate and the shared responsibility necessary to prevent torture forces NPMs to identify creative actions to strengthen its work. This is very positive”, says María José Urgel, Deputy Director of APT´s regional office for Latin America.An event to launch the first of these committees took place int June 2015 in connection to the International day in support of victims of torture. At this occasion, APT’s Deputy Director for the Latin America office was appointed Special Visitor of the municipality, in recognition of her work on torture prevention in Honduras.The CONAPREV is planning to set up other committees in three different locations in Honduras.
