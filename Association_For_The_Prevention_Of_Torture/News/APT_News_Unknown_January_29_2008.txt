Independent Custody Visiting in Scotland
January 29 2008
As in the UK as a whole, places of police detention in Scotland are regularly visited on an unannounced basis by appointed members of the local community, known as Independent Custody Visitors. The latter's task is to check on the welfare of persons deprived of their liberty by the police authorities.Owing to the volunteer basis of the overall scheme, it is essential that its functioning is well organized by a team of administrators. This training event was targeted at this crucially important group of persons responsible for the scheme in Scotland. By observing the training event and exchanging views with the participating administrators the APT gained more information about the functioning of Independent Custody Visiting in Scotland.The APT has previously collaborated with the Independent Custody Visiting Association (ICVA), which is the body responsible for overseeing Independent Custody Visiting in the UK. In June 2004 the ICVA arranged for two APT staff members to travel to Manchester in northern England to speak with representatives of Manchester Police Authority and to observe two Independent Custody Visitors monitoring police stations in the city. It is therefore hoped that this collaboration between the ICVA and the APT will continue in the future.
