Swiss-Senegalese exchange on torture prevention
November 7 2013
Senegal’s torture prevention mechanism has been operational for less than a year. Boubou Diouf Tall, the National Observer of Places of Deprivation of Liberty, concludes that the initial challenges of establishing the institution have been met. He is optimistic about the future: "What I wish for, at the end of my 5-year mandate, is to leave a strong, accepted, recognized and credible institution."“My aim is to have zero torture in Senegal”. In this short video, the National Observer of Places of Deprivation of Liberty in Senegal, Boubou Diouf Tall, talks about the current situation in his country and the priorities for his institution.Human rights advocates in Senegal and in the rest of Africa have high expectations on the new torture prevention body, and would like to see the National Observer to serve as a good example for other countries in the region, when establishing their National Preventive Mechanisms (NPMs) under the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention against Torture (OPCAT).Mr Tall and two members of his team were in Switzerland from 21 to 25 October 2013 invited by the APT. The programme included a joint monitoring visit to a Swiss detention centre with their Swiss counterpart, the National commission for the prevention of torture (CNPT), as well as a visit to Berne and to the Swiss Centre de formation pour le personnel pénitentiaire in Fribourg. The Senegalese delegation also had the opportunity to attend the Universal Period Review session of Senegal at the UN Human Rights Council.The aim of this working visit was to help strengthening the new Senegalese institution through an exchange of experiences and good practices with a more experienced national preventive mechanism. Last year the APT facilitated a similar working visit and exchange between the Senegalese NPM and the French Contrôleur général des lieux de privation de liberté.A longer version of the interview with Mr Tall can be found here
