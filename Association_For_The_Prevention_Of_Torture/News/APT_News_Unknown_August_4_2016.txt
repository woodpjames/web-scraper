Summer University focused on monitoring of police detention
August 4 2016
From 18 to 22 July 2016, the APT and the Human Rights Institute of Lyon organised the first French speaking summer school for National Preventive Mechanisms, to strengthen their knowledge and capacity in monitoring of police detention. The meeting aimed also at facilitating experience and good practices sharing between NPMs.Seventeen participants from 14 different countries (Albania, Côte d’Ivoire, Ecuador, France, Mali, Mauritius, Mauritania, Moldovia, Portugal, Romania, Senegal, Switzerland, Togo and Tunisia) attended the training and took the opportunity to share their own experiences and good practices in monitoring of police detention. They were able to benefit from the presence of torture prevention experts from the UN Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture (SPT), civil society organisations, the APT, the police and the French NPM, which facilitated various training sessions.Watch a short viideo from the training (in French)See more photos from the Summer University on our Facebook page
