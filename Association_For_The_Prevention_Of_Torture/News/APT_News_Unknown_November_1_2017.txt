APT's website now easy to access from mobile and tablets
November 1 2017
We are excited to announce the launch of our new website! With over 20% of visits to apt.ch already coming through handheld devices, we wanted to improve the service for our partners and other visitors to access our vast collection of resources from smartphones and tablets. We also used this opportunity to refresh our content.In particular, we redefined our missions with concrete examples of how we work - find out how we mobilise for prevention, accompany our partners and protect rights worldwide in What We Do.And we updated our regional pages with our latest priorities and projects in each region - check out what we're up to in Africa, the Americas, the Asia-Pacific region, Europe & Central Asia and in the Middle East & North Africa.We also redesigned our homepage so you can get all our latest news and main publications with one simple scroll. And we worked on the “Search” function in our Resources page to enable you to find our guides and other training material quicker.Some of the website’s contents still need to be refined, and further changes will be made over the coming weeks to increase its speed. We welcome your feedback. Please leave us a comment on info@apt.ch and let us know if you’re experiencing any technical difficulties.
