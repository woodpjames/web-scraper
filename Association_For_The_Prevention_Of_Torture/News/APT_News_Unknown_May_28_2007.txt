Workshop on Torture Prevention Skills for French-speaking national human rights institutions
May 28 2007
Staff members of French-speaking national human rights institutions met in Rabat, Morocco, from 29 May – 1 June 2007 for an APT-led workshop on torture prevention. The workshop was a key part of the capacity building programme 'Actors for Change' offered by APT in cooperation with the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). The workshop was co-hosted by the National Human Rights Institution of Morocco (Conseil Consultatif des Droits de L’Homme). Course participants included staff from institutions in Burkino Faso, Cameroun, Haiti, Mauritius, Morocco, Mali, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal, Togo and Canada.  Each had successfully completed the first phase of the programme, a distance-learning course structured around a training CD-rom, and including group email discussion and assignments with individual feedback from APT tutors.  The distance-learning phase focused on background knowledge on the legal and technical aspects of torture prevention, while the Rabat workshop aims at improving the application of that knowledge in real-world contexts, including during a training visit to the prison of Salé.  In the third phase of the programme, the participants will draft an action plan on torture prevention for their institution, which they are encouraged to present for actual adoption by their institution at the end of the course.
