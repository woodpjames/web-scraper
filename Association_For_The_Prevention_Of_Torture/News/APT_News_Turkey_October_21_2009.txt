Around 40 different government and civil society experts contributed to the one-and-a-half day meeting devoted to the form and structure of the country's future NPM.Dr Zdenek Hajek of the UN Subcommittee on the Prevention of Torture delivered the key-note speech during the opening session of the event, followed by representatives of various NPMs from European Union Member States. The latter informed the Turkish authorities and civil society of how the instrument is being implemented in their own countries. These included representatives from Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Prisons for England and Wales, France’s General Inspector of All Places of Deprivation of Liberty  and the Czech Republic's Public Defender's Office  (Ombudsman).In addition to learning more about the experiences of European Union Member States, the focus of the exchange turned to ensuring full compliance of the instrument in Turkey. In particular, during the second day of the meeting the participants discussed the strengths and weaknesses of different NPM models. It is expected that a short paper will be produced, which documents these pluses and minuses and which will form the basis of future discussions.Barbara Bernath, APT Chief of OperationsMatthew Pringle, APT Europe & Central Asia Programme OfficerAnja Härtwig, APT Publications OfficerThis project is funded by the European Commission.
