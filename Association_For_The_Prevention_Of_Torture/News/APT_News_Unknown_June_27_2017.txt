Thai civil society calls government to prohibit torture
June 27 2017
“No Anti-Torture Law, No Justice” was the theme of this year’s International Day in Support of Victims of Torture celebration in Thailand. The anti-torture and enforced disappearance draft bill has been suspended from further adoption earlier this year. The Thai civil societies continue to advocate for criminalisation of torture in line with the State’s commitment under the international Convention against Torture.The need for anti-torture and enforced disappearance law in Thailand was further visualized by Shazeera Ahmad Zawawi through an-info comic entitled “Torture is a Crime.” The info-comic was widely disseminated during the event as a potential educational tool for partners in Thailand to raise public awareness on the law.In addition to that, a half day event was held on 23 June in Bangkok. The event included a movie screening, a talk by Pr. Vitit Muntarbhon, the UN Independent Expert on violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, as well as a public forum. The effort was spearheaded by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Cross Cultural Foundation, the International Commission of Jurists, Amnesty International Thailand and the APT.The dedication shown by civil society in Thailand will hopefully lead to renewed commitment from the government to adopt and implement the anti-torture and enforced disappearance law in the near future. This would be a significant way for Thailand to reiterate its national and international pledges to prevent and prohibit torture.
