Indonesia invests in training of police to prevent torture
September 25 2015
Attitude change and capacity building of the police are key factors for an effective implementation of the UN Convention against Torture. With this insight, the Indonesian government embarked in 2013 on a cooperation with the APT to further develop a training programme for the law enforcement sector.The training programme, which aims at raising awareness of the implementation of the Convention, draws on a pool of national master trainers, from the police in different regions of Indonesia. They will now organise training sessions for law enforcement officers in their regions.A Training of Trainers Manual has been produced by a local consultant, jointly with the Ministry of Law and Human Rights, and contains practical guidance on how to prepare, run and evaluate training on the Convention against Torture. The final version of the manual was developed through a series of consultations and regional trainings, to make sure that the content is suitable for the local context and to the needs of the law enforcement in Indonesia.The manual was completed in June 2015 and a Masters Training was held in Jakarta on 9-12 August. 16 participants had been selected for the three-day training course. They will now train their colleagues in two regions.The cooperation between the APT and the Indonesian government, through the Directorate General of Human Rights and the Ministry of Law and Human Rights, is an example of a constructive partnership in raising awareness and strengthening the capacity of the law enforcement sector in preventing torture. While APTâ€™s role has been to provide technical expertise, Indonesia has shown strong commitment and ownership of the project. We now hope that the manual will be disseminated broadly in neighbouring ASEAN countries.
