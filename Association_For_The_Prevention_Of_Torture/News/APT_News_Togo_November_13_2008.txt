Seminar for Parliamentarians (22 - 23 October 2008)BackgroundIn February 2008, the APT participated in a workshop for parliamentarians organized by the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) in Lom√©, Togo. This workshop was in the framework of a global IPU project on the role of parliaments in the implementation of international and regional instruments. The main goal of the workshop was to 'Enhance the Participation of Togolese Parliamentarians in the Work of the Human Rights Treaty Bodies'.The workshop came up with a national strategy with four key components namely: ratification of regional and international treaties, legislative reform, control of government and participation of parliamentarians in the work of treaty bodies. A Follow-up Committee was established, comprised of three parliamentarians, a representative of the National Human Rights Commission and a representative of the Civil Society Organizations. It was also agreed that a follow-up workshop would be organized in October 2008, to assess the implementation of short term objectives of the national strategy and to discuss the way forward towards the implementation of mid-term and long-term objectives. It is in this context that the APT was again invited to Togo to participate in and facilitate the October seminar.Development of the SeminarThe APT made a key-note presentation on the reporting to the Treaty Bodies and on the role of parliamentarians in such a process.The Chairperson of the Follow-up Committee established in February 2008 presented its report on the implementation of short term objectives. The presentation, which was followed by lively discussions, showed that the Committee faced three kind of challenges namely lack of financial resources, administrative problems and lack of clarity on the legal nature of the Committee.Participants discussed possible solutions to overcome problems and to facilitate the future work of the Committee and the implementation of the national strategy in general. The workshop adopted recommendations to guide the future work of the Follow-up Committee and to overcome the challenges facing the implementation of long-term objectives of the national strategy.2.

All interlocutors were positive on the ratification of the OPCAT. The APT was informed that a draft law on the ratification of the OPCAT was submitted to the Parliament in August and is currently under consideration by the respective Parliamentary Committees on Human Rights and on Foreign Affairs.OPCAT roundtable discussionThe APT jointly with the OHCHR-Togo convened a round table discussion on torture prevention with the objectives of familiarising participants with the OPCAT and briefing them on the potential benefits and implications of a ratification by Togo.
