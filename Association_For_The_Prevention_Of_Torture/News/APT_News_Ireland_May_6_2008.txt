NPM discussions continue in Ireland
May 6 2008
Irish government and human rights actors once again examined the possible implementation of the OPCAT. On 7 May the Irish Human Rights Commission hosted a roundtable discussion on the various mechanisms which might serve as the country's future NPM. The APT travelled to Dublin to speak at the event, which it is hoped will lead the way to more in-depth discussion about the implementation of the OPCAT and eventual ratification of the instrument in Ireland.Irish government and human rights actors once again examined the possible implementation of the OPCAT. On 7 May 2008 the Irish Human Rights Commission hosted a half-day roundtable discussion at the Royal Irish Academy on the various mechanisms which might serve as the country's future NPM.This was the second national event devoted to this all-important question - the first national meeting on the OPCAT was organized in September 2007  by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties. The meeting carried on from where last year's discussion left off and examined more concretely various models for an NPM.The APT travelled to Dublin to speak at the event alongside other representatives from the Irish Human Rights Commission and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties. The International Subcommittee on Prevention was represented by its Danish member, Dr. Hans Draminsky Petersen.Although Ireland has a number of existing detention monitoring mechanisms they vary in the degree to which they are compliant with the OPCAT. In addition to the Irish Human Rights Commission, these include the Garda Siochana Ombudsman Commission and Inspectorate, Office of the Ombudsman for Children, Inspectorate of Prisons and Places of Detention, Inspectorate of Mental Health Services and the Office of the Chief Inspector of Social Services as well as other bodies. The event addressed this issue of compatibility and mapped out various possible models for Ireland, including an NPM comprising of several existing monitoring bodies, one of which could act as some form of central coordinating focal point.It is hoped that this second roundtable on the OPCAT will lead the way to more in-depth discussion about the implementation of the OPCAT and eventual ratification of the instrument in Ireland.
