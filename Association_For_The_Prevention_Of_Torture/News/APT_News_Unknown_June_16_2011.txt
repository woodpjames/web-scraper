Annual UN resolutions on torture
June 16 2011
The UN General Assembly and the UN Human Rights Council annually adopt a resolution on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. These resolutions are usually adopted by consensus, which means that no UN Member State, in the case of the UNGA resolution, and no UN Human Rights Council’s Member State, in the case of the HRC resolution, has opposed to these texts. The APT, through the UN & Legal Programme, is actively engaging with the relevant stakeholders in order to strengthen the text of these resolutions towards better protection against torture and other forms of ill-treatment.The UN General Assembly’s resolution represents an important instrument reflecting the minimum baseline agreed by all Member States of the international community on issues related to torture and other forms of ill-treatment. The Human Rights Council’s resolution represents the views of the Member States to the main UN Human Rights organ. As such, they both shall be used by all relevant actors active in the fight against torture, in particular when dealing with States representatives.
