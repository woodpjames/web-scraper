Brazil's commitments to the UN should be followed by concrete measures
September 21 2017
APT delivered a statement during the 36th session of the UN Human Rights Council urging the Brazilian government to take effective measures to implement mechanisms to prevent torture in all states of the country and to strengthen the expansion of custody hearings as a tool to prevent torture and ill-treatment.Brazil was before the UN in Geneva to express its support for more than 240 recommendations issued by member countries of the UN Human Rights Council during the Universal Periodic Review last May. Of the recommendations issued, more than 40 were aimed at combatting torture, ill-treatment, police violence, overcrowding, and inhumane and degrading conditions of detention. In the response that the Brazilian government submitted to the United Nations, the State "recognizes the urgent need for improvements in the penitentiary system."According to Sylvia Dias, APT Representative for Brazil, "the severity of institutional violence in the country, characterized by an alarming level of violence, deaths and overcrowding inside prison centres, was one of the most reiterated issues among the recommendations formulated to Brazil, which reflects the serious concern of the international community. Now, it is up to Brazil to take seriously the commitment it makes to the UN today and urgently initiate the implementation of recommendations to prevent torture and ill-treatment in the country.‚ÄùRead here the full statement.More information in Portuguese
