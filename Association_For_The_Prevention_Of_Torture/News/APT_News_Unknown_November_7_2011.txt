Lebanese parliament to consider establishing a National Preventive Mechanism
November 7 2011
A draft bill to establish a National Preventive Mechanism (NPM) has been introduced in the parliamentary process in Lebanon on November 3, 2011.The law foresees the establishment of a National Human Rights Institution that includes a permanent Committee for the Prevention of Torture which will function as the Lebanese NPM. The law was introduced by two members of the human rights committee of parliament, Deputies Ghassan Mouheiber and Michel Moussa. The text is the fruit of a series of debates which involved members of parliament, representatives of the executive, national and international NGOs and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. The APT has also submitted comments at several stages of the drafting process. In an innovative way, the law defines the mandate of the National Preventive Mechanism while establishing a new National Human Rights Institution. Lebanon was the first State in the Middle East and North Africa to ratify the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention against Torture in December 2008 through which it committed to establishing a NPM.Press Release (PDF)
