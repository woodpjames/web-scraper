Trabelsi v. Italy
April 10 2010
On  13 April 2010 the European Court found in the  case  Trabelsi v. Italy that Italy had violated Article 3 of the  Convention  for deporting a man to Tunisia in December 2008, placing him  at risk of  torture or ill-treatment. In doing so the Court also held  that Italy had  ignored its request not to deport the man while it  examined the  complaint and therefore failed to comply with a so-called  interim  measure under Article 34 of the Convention.Click to access the ECHR case law database
