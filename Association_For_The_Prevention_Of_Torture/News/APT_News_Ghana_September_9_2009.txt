OPCAT Promotion in Ghana
September 9 2009
A delegation from the APT, headed by Secretary General Mark Thomson, travelled to Accra, Ghana from 15 to 17 September 2009. This followed a previous visit in June 2006. The September visit, organised jointly with the Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice of Ghana (CHRAJ), included a variety of meetings with relevant high-level government, authorities, parliamentarians, the CHARJ and civil society organisations. The aim of the meetings was to explore initiatives to better prevent torture and ill-treatment in Ghana. In particular, the APT promoted an early ratification of the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention against Torture, which Ghana signed on 6 November 2006.Briefing Note{gallery}ghana0909{/gallery}
