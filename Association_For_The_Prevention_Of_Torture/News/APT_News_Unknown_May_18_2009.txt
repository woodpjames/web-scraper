"What I would like to achieve is that my grand-children can be proud one day, when - after some setbacks - the situation of human rights in the world has improved a little bit". He stressed that a lot remains to be done, from closing Guantanamo to changing the unconstitutional refugee and foreigner laws in Switzerland. In his speech he stressed that what he has achieved was the fruit of the engagement of many persons, and thanked his family, the partners in his law firm, the APT and the University of St.Gallen.The vice president of the University and Marco Mona both recalled the historical link between the University of St.Gallen and the APT, evoking the so-called "St.Gallen Group", formed around the former President of the University and his wife, Adolf and Martita JÃ¶hr-Rohr, who had provided crucial support to the APT since the 1970s. This award ties in with, and will hopefully revive, this historical link between St.Gallen and Geneva.University of St. Gallen Press ReleaseWeb article - Radio suisse italienneVideo coverage - rsi.ch  (20h00 edition, RealPlayer, at 15:07 minutes)
