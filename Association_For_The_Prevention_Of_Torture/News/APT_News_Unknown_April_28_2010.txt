The Budapest-based non-governmental organization, the Mental Disability Advocacy Center (MDAC), recently embarked upon a one-year UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office-supported project to devise and pilot guidelines on this vitally important aspect of the Convention, for which purpose it brought together a group of ten experts for a one-day exchange of ideas. More information about the overall project and, more specifically about Article 33 of the CRPD, is available on this page of the MDAC website.The APT was specifically invited to the meeting in order to bring its extensive advice and expertise to the table in relation to the putting in place of National Preventive Mechanisms under the OPCAT, which has a great deal of relevance in relation to Article 33 of the CRPD. Similar to the OPCAT, the CRPD foresees the designation or establishment of one or more independent mechanisms to promote, protect and monitor the implementation of the Convention. The emergence of guidelines on these bodies will be an invaluable tool for national actors. Moreover, there will inevitably be an overlap of the activities of the mechanisms put in place in countries which have ratified both the OPCAT and CRPD. The group of experts discussed these and other important issues.
