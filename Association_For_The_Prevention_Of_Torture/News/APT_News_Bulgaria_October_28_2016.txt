October 28 2016
The APT is extremely concerned about the attack yesterday on its Board member, prominent Bulgarian human rights activist and head of the Bulgarian Helsinki Committee Krassimir Kanev. We call on Bulgarian authorities to take all necessary measures for an immediate and effective investigation into his assault.On 27 October, Krassimir Kanev was attacked in the street by two unknown assailants, who beat him in the face and stomach, leaving him injured. The perpetrators managed to flee and are so far not identified.Krassimir Kanev and his organisation, the Bulgarian Helsinki Committee, have been harassed and received threats in past years for their work defending human rights in Bulgaria, including for groups in situations of vulnerability such as minorities and migrants.The APT expresses its full solidarity with Krassimir Kanev and the Bulgarian Helsinki Committee and calls on Bulgaria to take effective measures to prevent any assaults against human rights defenders in the future.
