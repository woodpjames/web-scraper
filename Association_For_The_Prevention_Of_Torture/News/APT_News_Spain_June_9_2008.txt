June 9 2008
The APT was invited to participate in the '2nd Conference on the Application in Spain of the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention against Torture', which took place in Madrid, Spain on 11 June 2008. The event was organized by the University Institute for International and European Studies 'Francisco de Vitoria' of the Carlos III University, under the auspices of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Spain, the Ministry of Justice of Spain and the Inter-American and European Network on Human Rights (LAEHR).The event aimed to provide a comparative analysis, relevant to the Spanish context, of implementation of the OPCAT in different States Parties which must designate their National Preventive Mechanism (NPM). National and international practitioners and experts participated, including three members of the UN Subcommittee on Torture Prevention (SPT).The APT delivered a presentation about the participation of civil society in the NPMs generally and in Spain in particular, based on the recent APT policy paper  on the matter.Since Spain ratified the OPCAT in April 2006, the APT has played a key role in bringing together relevant state and civil society actors in Spain to jointly construct an adequate and legitimate NPM.Event Program'La Sociedad Civil y los Mecanismos Nacionales de Prevenci√≥n de la Tortura'Claudia Gerez, Americas Programme OfficerMarina Narvaez, UN & Legal Programme Officer
