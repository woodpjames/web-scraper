APT Submission to the Australian National Human Rights Consultation
July 6 2009
The APT welcomes the national human rights consultation initiated by the Government of Australia, which seeks ideas and views from the community on the promotion and protection of human rights in Australia. Australia has shown a clear commitment to torture prevention by signing the OPCAT on 19 May 2009 and committing to strengthening domestic laws prohibiting torture.In its submission to the consultation in June 2009, the APT urged Australia to take further steps to prevent torture and other ill-treatment and improve the protection of the rights of persons deprived of their liberty by ratifying and implementing the OPCAT. The submission explains how the OPCAT could assist Australia to prevent torture and other ill-treatment and sets out a number of reasons for prompt ratification.View APT's submission to the Australian national human rights consultationAustralian national human rights consultation websiteContact: Jem Stevens, APT Asia Pacific Programme Officer
