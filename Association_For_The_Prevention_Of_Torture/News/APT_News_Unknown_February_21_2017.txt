Thai army must drop charges against human rights defenders
February 21 2017
The Thai army proceeds with its investigation into the defamation charges against former APT Fellow Pornpen Khongkachonkiet and her colleagues Somchai Homlaor and Achaana Heemmina. Yesterday a prosecutor examined the case and indicated the possibility of further prosecution. The next round of investigation will take place 21 March 2017.In 2016, the Thai army filed “criminal defamation” charges against Pornpen Khongkachonkiet, Somchai Homlaor and Achaana Heemmina over a report documenting torture and ill-treatment in the Southern Border Provinces. Pornpen and her colleagues have shown exceptional perseverance and commitment by continuing to advocate for torture prevention in Thailand, while facing serious reprisals from the military.We reiterate our call for the withdrawal of the legal action against these leading human rights defenders and strongly support their efforts to bring to light cases of torture in their country.
