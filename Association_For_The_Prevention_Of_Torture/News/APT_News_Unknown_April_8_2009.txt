April 8 2009
Representative Office of the OHCHR in Central AsiaOmbudsman of the Kyrgyz RepublicOSCE-ODIHRVoice of Freedom NGO CoalitionThe Kyrgyz Republic deposited its ratification of the OPCAT with the UN on 29 December 2008 and has until 28 December 2009 to put in place its national monitoring body. The 16 April event was a timely moment to examine the viability of the proposed NPM model and to scrutinize the compatibility of the draft NPM legislation with the requirements of the OPCAT text.Around 60 persons attended the event in order to discuss the legislation in-depth. Although the draft NPM legislation was comprehensive and largely in compliance with the provisions of the OPCAT text, the proposed model was ultimately rejected by certain key participants. The latter felt that there would be problems in promoting the legislation in parliament and in securing finance for the institution. The Kyrgyz Ombudsman numbered among the influential participants who had doubts about the NPM proposal. It therefore remains to be seen which new proposals emerge in the coming months.
