The prohibition and prevention of torture in Mauritania
April 13 2011
The APT, together with the Conseil National des Droits de lâ€™Homme, recently organised a workshop on 'Protecting the rights of persons  deprived of liberty', in Nouakchott, Mauritania. The workshop took place in the context of an increase in the detention  monitoring powers of the CNDH, as their founding legislation has been  strengthened to give it more explicit powers to conduct  unannounced visits to places of detention.
