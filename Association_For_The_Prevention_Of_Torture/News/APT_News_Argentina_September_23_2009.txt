Monitoring Places of Detention in Argentina
September 23 2009
The APT is co-sponsoring a training course on monitoring places of detention for practitioners in Argentina. The course began in September with three introductory lectures offered by the APT: 'Combating torture in the universal human rights system'; 'The concept of preventive detention monitoring' and 'National Preventive Mechanisms under the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention against Torture'.The APT is co-sponsoring a training course on monitoring places of detention for practitioners in Argentina. The four-month course is organized by the federal Prison Ombdusman Office (Procuración Penitenciaria), the Committee against Torture of the Province of Buenos Aires (Comite contra la Tortura de la Comisión Provincial por la Memoria) and the National Universities of La Plata and Buenos Aires. The course began in September with three introductory lectures offered by the APT: 'Combating torture in the universal human rights system'; 'The concept of preventive detention monitoring' and 'National Preventive Mechanisms under the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention against Torture (OPCAT)'. The training course consists of lectures and workshops taking place simultaneously in Buenos Aires and La Plata, as well as classes offered in the University Center of the federal prison of 'Devoto'.The APT was unfortunately denied entry to this prison to accompany personnel of the Prison Ombudsman Office and to give a presentation to persons deprived of liberty enrolled in university studies. The APT also took advantage of its presence in Argentina to lobby the federal Congress for adoption of a draft NPM law, as well as to lend support to the adoption of preventive mechanisms in Provinces of this federal state, particularly Chaco. Following the broad dissemination of a video featuring a prison guard recruit being tortured by his colleagues as a form of initiation to the service, which dramatically brought the issue of torture to public light, a civil society platform called on the federal government to urgently meet its international obligation of designating its NPM (NGO Communiqué).{gallery}argentina0909{/gallery}
