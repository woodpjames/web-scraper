Official launch of the UK National Preventive Mechanism
May 18 2009
On 31 March 2009 simultaneous written ministerial statements were made in the House of Commons and the House of Lords, formally announcing the establishment of the UK's NPM. Eighteen individual visiting bodies will compose the overall NPM, including nine in England and Wales, five in Scotland and four in Northern Ireland. The 19 May 2009 meeting was the first opportunity since then for the members of the NPM to discuss its functioning. It is envisaged that the exchange will result in further meetings aimed at ensuring the effective, coordinated operation of the NPM.See also The United Kingdom's National Preventive Mechanism
