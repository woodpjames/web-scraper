Building blocks for a torture free future
December 21 2011
Repressive regimes are characterized by widespread torture and ill-treatment. Does torture disappear automatically with the fall of such regimes? No, it does not, unless there is a clear political will to end the scourge of torture. But it can be stopped when concrete measures are taken. These measures can be taken immediately, by any new or transitory authority. They constitute the building blocks for the torture free future.The APT presents eight such building blocks, in a worksheet submitted at the conference on the Arab spring that took place in Cairo from 11 - 14 December 2011.
