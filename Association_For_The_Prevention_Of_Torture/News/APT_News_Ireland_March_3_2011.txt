Northern Ireland NPM Meeting
March 3 2011
The five bodies designated as the UK NPM in Northern Ireland met in Belfast on 25 February in order to discuss a number of common issues. The  exchange was hosted by one of the five bodies, the Regulation and  Quality Improvement Authority. The APT was invited to the event in order to contextualize the overall  discussion internationally, particularly to speak about how the OPCAT is  being implemented elsewhere as well as the role of the UN Subcommittee  on Prevention.
