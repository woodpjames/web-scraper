Training on the criminalisation of torture in Morocco
March 20 2008
The APT co-organised a training seminar for magistrates and representatives of the police force and prison staff with the Moroccan Ministry of Justice, which took place on 11-12 March 2008 in Rabat.The participants and Moroccan and international experts, including a member of the UN Committee against torture and a representative of the APT, discussed theoretical and practical issues and practices related to the implementation of the new law criminalising torture. They also identified certain gaps which could be bridged on the occasion of the next revision of the penal code, for legislation to be totally in line with the UN Convention against torture. Participants notably recommended in the seminar report to close those gaps and ensure that Morocco ratifies the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention against Torture (OPCAT) as soon as possible.La criminalisation de la torture au Maroc: Commentaires et recommandations (f√©vrier 2008){gallery}rabat{/gallery}
