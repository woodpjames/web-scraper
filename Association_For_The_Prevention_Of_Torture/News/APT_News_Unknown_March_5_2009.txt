Detention Monitoring Training for OHCHR Staff
March 5 2009
On 4 March, APT held a detention monitoring training in Geneva for staff from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). The training focussed on preparing and conducting a visit and challenges and options with regards to interviewing detention authorities and persons deprived of their liberty. The training forms part of APT's commitment to assist the OHCHR in its work with the Special Procedures and Treaty Bodies. APT also collaborates on torture prevention with OHCHR's National Human Rights Institutions Unit and OHCHR field offices including through the provision of detention monitoring training, most recently in Nepal last month.
