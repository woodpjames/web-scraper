Mexico before the UN Committee Against Torture
November 1 2012
The State of Mexico is currently being reviewed by the Committee Against Torture, a UN body composed of 10 independent experts, tasked with monitoring the State's compliance with the UN Convention Against Torture.During the session, the Committee expressed concern, among others, at the continuing practice of torture in Mexico - including in the context of detention under "arraigo", the use of statements obtained by torture in criminal proceedings, and the deficiencies in the investigation of torture cases, which result in a very high level of impunity for such crime.Based on the dialogue with the State, the Committee will issue new recommendations to the Mexican State in three weeks.For more information, see the press release issued yesterday by Mexican and international non-governmental organizations, including the APT (in Spanish only).The sessions of the Committee can be followedÂ through live webcast.
