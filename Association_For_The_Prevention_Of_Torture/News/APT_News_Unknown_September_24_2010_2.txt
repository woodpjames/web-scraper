Popa v. Moldova
September 24 2010
On 21 September in the case of Popa v. Moldova the European Court ruled that the latter had failed to conduct an effective investigation into Tatiana Popaâ€™s complaint that she had been beaten by police while in detention in July 2004 in violation of Article 3. Moldova was also found to have violated Article 13 of the Convention, as the complainant did not have an effective remedy under domestic law to claim compensation for her ill-treatment.
