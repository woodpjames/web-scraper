The European Union and its member states do not yet make full use of all the public diplomacy tools at their disposal when it comes to torture. This is one of the concerns raised by APT and other anti-torture organisations with regard to the forthcoming revision of the EU Action Plan on Human Rights and Diplomacy for 2015-2017.The APT, jointly with Amnesty International, FIACAT, IRCT and OMCT, has outlined a number of key recommendations for the revised Action Plan. These recommendations include:An opportunity to discuss and provide input to the revision of the Action Plan will be a high-level event on 3 December 2014 in Brussels to reflect on the 30th anniversary on the UN Convention against Torture. The discussions will bring together key stakeholders to exchange good practice, positive experiences and suggestions on how to better and more quickly achieve the aim of eradicating torture.
