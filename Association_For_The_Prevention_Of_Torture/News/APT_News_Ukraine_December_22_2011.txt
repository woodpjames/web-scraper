Veniosov v. Ukraine
December 22 2011
On 15 December in the case of Veniosov v. Ukraine (no. 30634/05) the European Court found a violation of Article 3 resulting from the complainantâ€™s degrading conditions of detention while awaiting trial in 2005-2006. The man, a former police officer, complained about severe overcrowding in a cell with no windows and poor heating, to the extent that in November 2005 an ambulance had to be called as he had hyperthermia.
