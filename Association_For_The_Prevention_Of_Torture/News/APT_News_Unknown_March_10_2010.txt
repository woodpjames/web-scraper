The newly created Swiss National Commission for the Prevention of Torture invited the APT to organise a one day exchange to analyse together the establishment of the mechanism and the preventive detention monitoring methodology. During the morning session the members analysed and discussed the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and challenges of the Commission in view of starting to define together a clear vision and mission. The afternoon session was dedicated to examining and discussing the different stages of a preventive detention methodology. This one day exchange fostered a timely discussion amongst all the  members of the Commission on the actual functioning of the NPM in  practice.The meeting took place on 09 March 2010 at the Swiss Training Centre for Penitentiary Personnel in Fribourg.
