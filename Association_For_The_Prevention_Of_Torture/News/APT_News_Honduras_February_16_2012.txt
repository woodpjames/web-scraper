Honduras prison disaster: Immediate action needed
February 16 2012
The Honduran authorities must take immediate action to reduce overcrowding in prisons and establish clear security protocols for emergency and evacuation.The fire in Honduran prison La Granja Penal de Comayagua, which according to media reports killed more than 350 inmates on 15 February, is a cruel reminder of the need for independent monitoring of treatment and conditions in all places of detention.

The Association for the Prevention of Torture (APT) reminds the Honduran authorities that severe overcrowding is a form of cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. It is critical that the State assign adequate resources to the National Committee for the Prevention of Torture so that it can fulfill its role as provided by the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention against Torture. The APT also urges the National Congress to accelerate the adoption of the draft Prisons Act, which still after several years has not been processed.
