Training Workshop in Uganda
January 26 2007
From 27 to 29 November 2006, the APT organised jointly with the Uganda Human Rights Commission (UHRC) and the African Centre for Treatment and Rehabilitation of Victims (ACTV), a three-day training workshop for representatives of civil society organisations in Kampala, Uganda.This workshop was a kick-off event of a five-year project aiming to enhance the capacity of civil society organisations and the UHRC to monitor places of detention as well as to advocate for the ratification and implementation of the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention Against Torture. This programme will also reinforce the cooperation between the UHRC and civil society organisations.Twenty three participants from twelve NGOs, including two members of the UHRC, attended the training. During 2007 this training will be followed by a distance learning phase during which attendees of the 3-day seminar will implement a monitoring programme under the guidance of APT experts. The capacity strengthening programme will be completed with a 2-day follow-up workshop to share best practices of participants in about a years time.
