Preventing Violence in Closed Institutions for Juveniles
October 6 2008
The APT was invited by Defence for Children International (DCI) to facilitate a workshop in Brussels on 02 October 2008 on the issue of independent monitoring systems. The event took place during DCI's International Conference and Training 'Ending Violence against Children in Juvenile Justice Systems: From Words to Action'. APT's workshop put special emphasis on the methodology of visiting, on how NGOs can obtain access to places of detention for juveniles and on the obligations of states parties in regard to setting up such monitoring systems.Children deprived of liberty are especially vulnerable and at risk of becoming victims of violence and torture. This is a key finding of the study of the world report on violence against children, published by the UN in 2006. In order to prevent such violence, the study calls upon states to implement their obligation to set up and maintain independent monitoring systems and to ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture. This has led to an increased interest by child-rights NGOs in setting up monitoring programs or calling upon their states to maintain such independent monitoring systems.International standards on the obligation to maintain systems of preventive monitoring for juvenile institutions - English French SpanishConference Website
