Challenges of preventive monitoring discussed in the Philippines
December 5 2011
Fifteen regional and sub regional offices met at the National Human Rights Commission central office in Manila, Philippines to discuss and exchange on their needs, their work in monitoring and the daily challenges encountered. The workshop was a direct follow up to the blended learning project on 'Preventing Torture' for five NHRIs in South East Asia (Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, Timor-Leste) held in November 2010.During the annual meeting of Senior Executive Officers in Sydney in 2011, CHR Philippines reported that the detention monitoring plan developed by CHRP staff during the workshop had been mainstreamed into the CHRP's strategic action plan.The national workshop was thus an opportunity to bring all the regional offices together in Manila, to present the detention monitoring plan and to discuss their work in monitoring, their needs and the daily challenges which they encountered. Three non governmental organizations (NGOs) also participated, namely the Balay Rehabilitation Center, the Medical Action Group and the Task Force Detainees of the Philippines.

During the workshop, the preventive approach to monitoring was introduced and discussed and the APT facilitated sessions on the methodology of preventive visits, on reports and recommendations and on cooperation with other actors, referring to practices of other mechanisms.

Participants reflected on their practice of detention monitoring in their regions and identified some key issues that could be addressed in order to carry out preventive monitoring - such as developing specific monitoring tools, team and partnership building.AgendaList of Participants
