In this latter connection draft legislation which would ratify the instrument has already been submitted to the Kyrgyz parliament, Jogorko Kenesh, for its consideration. The second event, 'OPCAT: Next Steps for Kyrgyz Civil Society', was held on 17 October and aimed to support Kyrgyz civil society in their efforts to ensure that the instrument is both ratified and an effective national visiting mechanism is established in the country. Around 15 civil society activists participated in the discussion.  During the two exchanges the experiences of other countries were relayed in relation to ratification and implementation of the OPCAT and the best practices were drawn from these national processes. In particular, Lilit Petrosyan of the Civil Society Institute  in Armenia was invited to Bishkek to speak about her organization's successful ratification campaign in Armenia.The event was used to officially launch the Russian translation  of the APT’s publication, Guide on the Establishment and Designation of National Preventive Mechanisms. The publication was financially supported by OSCE-ODIHR and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands.
