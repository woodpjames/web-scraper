Planning Strategies for an NPM Visit
October 19 2010
This third NPM Thematic Workshop of the 'European NPM Project' took place recently in Armenia, and focused on the planning strategies that an NPM might want to consider when planning and structuring a programme of visits and a specific visit to any place of deprivation of liberty. The European NPM Project is unique in that it is the only initiative in  the Council of Europe region which regularly brings together European  NPMs for the purpose of such peer-to-peer exchanges and which offers  NPMs in-country detention monitoring trainings.
