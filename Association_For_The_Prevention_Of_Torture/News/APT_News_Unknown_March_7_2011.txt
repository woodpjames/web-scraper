Rapporteurships, treaty organs, and other bodies working nationally and internationally are entrusted with carrying out this key function and have developed a rich body of principles and practices. Yet there have been few formal opportunities to share experiences and learn from each other in order to enhance efficiency and avoid duplication. This conference convened top experts including mandate holders, policymakers, lawyers, NGOs, scholars, and practitioners from around the world to analyze key challenges confronting detention visits today and establish channels for enhancing collaboration.On the previous day (March 17), APT and the Washington College of Law organised an international peer-to-peer exchange on enhancing visits to places of detention through an improved collaboration and the sharing of working methods amongst representatives of the universal and regional systems, namely the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, the UN Committee against Torture, the UN Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture, the Special Rapporteur on Prison's and Conditions of Detention in Africa, and the Committee for the Prevention of Torture in Africa. Representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights also attended this private working session. All participants agreed on the need to further strengthen the ties between mechanisms and to improve synergies regarding planning and follow-up of the visits. On March 16, representatives of the United Nations anti-torture mechanisms and the IACHR Office of the Rapporteur on the Right of Persons Deprived of Liberty held a meeting in Washington to address grave problem of torture and overcrowding in correctional facilities in the region.
