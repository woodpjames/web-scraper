Khodorkovskiy v Russia
November 29 2010
On 31 May 2011 in the case of Khodorkovskiy v Russia the Court found, among others, two violations of Article 3 of the Convention (prohibition of inhuman or degrading treatment) owing to the detaineeâ€™s conditions of detention in which he was held in court as well as in pre-trial detention after August 2005.In relation to his detention in court, the European Court found that, despite the fact that he had been accused of non-violent crimes and had no criminal record and there was no evidence he was predisposed to violence, he had been kept in the cage throughout the trial, exposed to the public at large, which had humiliated him, at least in his own eyes, and aroused in him feelings of inferiority.Click to access the ECHR case law database
