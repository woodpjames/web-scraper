Time for universal rejection of torture!
May 7 2013
Today, 7 May 2013, marks the 25th anniversary of the UN Committee against Torture, the guardian of one of the most widely accepted international human rights conventions. In a campaign for universal ratification of the Convention against Torture, the APT together with six other leading human rights organisations now call on the remaining 42 countries to join the treaty.The Convention against Torture, ratified by 153 countries, is the only treaty at the international level concerned exclusively with the eradication of torture around the world. By ratifying the convention, States commit to make torture a crime, ensure accountability for perpetrators, and to provide redress for torture victims. The Convention also requires States parties to take effective measures to prevent all forms of torture and ill-treatment of people deprived of their liberty.In a joint effort, we therefore address the remaining States to encourage them to join the Convention and make it the first universally-ratified human rights treaty â€“ and a great step towards a world free from torture. Of the countries that have not yet ratified the UN Convention against Torture almost all have made voluntary pledges to consider ratification, especially in the context of the regular Universal Periodic Review by the Geneva-based UN Human Rights Council.Together with international NGOs Redress, TRIAL, IRCT, FIACAT, Alkarama and OMCT we call on all States which are not yet parties to the Convention to seize the opportunity of the 25th anniversary of the Committee against Torture, and take this necessary step towards the global eradication of torture.
