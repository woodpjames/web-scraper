NGOs draw attention to human rights situation in Sri Lanka
September 2 2013
For many, Sri Lanka is a holiday paradise. But the repression of the opposition has intensified, the persecution of the Tamil population continues, and the Government has not yet initiated any credible and independent investigation of the war crimes committed in 2009.Today the Swiss Refugee Council, the Société pour les peuples menacés and Amnesty International launch a campaign, calling on the Swiss Federal Council to take action to support human rights in Sri Lanka and to protect Sri Lankan asylum seekers. The APT fully supports this initiative. Please sign the petition here!Read the full press release (in French)
