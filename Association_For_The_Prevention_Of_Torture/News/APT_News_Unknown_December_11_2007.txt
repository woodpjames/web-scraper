Judges and Prosecutors: The Prevention and Investigation of Torture
December 11 2007
On 15 December 2007 the APT and the Centre for the Protection of Constitutional Rights held a one-day seminar in Tbilisi for judges and prosecutors on the prevention and investigation of torture. Using the Georgian translation of the University of Essex's 'Combating Torture: A Manual for Judges and Prosecutors' the participants explored a number of crucial topics including the absolute prohibition of torture in international law, safeguards against torture for those deprived of their liberty, the role of judges and prosecutors in protecting detainees from torture and conducting investigations and inquiries into acts of abuse.The seminar was the first of a series of events on this subject planned for Georgia in 2007-2008.As a result of this event a group of approximately twenty judges and other experts learnt about their duties and responsibilities to prevent and investigate acts of torture and other forms of ill-treatment. It is also expected that there will be greater access and use of the University of Essex's manual in Georgia and an enhanced awareness of the important lessons contained therein.This seminar was the first of a series of events planned on the subject in Georgia in 2007-2008. A second seminar is planned outside of Tbilisi for the first half of 2008.'Combating Torture: A Manual for Judges and Prosecutors'  (University of Essex, Georgian)Agenda (English)Agenda (Georgian)
