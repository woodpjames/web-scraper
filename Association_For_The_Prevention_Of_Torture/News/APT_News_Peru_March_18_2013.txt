Peru must address conditions of detention
March 18 2013
APT called upon Peru to ensure effective implementation of recommendations to address the conditions of detention and treatment of persons deprived of their liberty in an oral statement presented on 15 March in the UN Human Rights Council during the adoption of the final outcome of the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) of Peru.We further urged Peru to implement the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and to promptly establish an independent national preventive mechanism provided with the necessary financial resources to fulfill its mandate effectively, autonomously and independently.What is UPR? Universal Periodic Review (UPR) is a process in which the human rights record of every United Nations Member State is reviewed by other States. Each State is reviewed once every four years. Every Member State participated in the first cycle (2008-2011) and now the second cycle (2012-2016) is underway. The APT advocates for States to make UPR recommendations to other States on torture prevention. In addition, we make oral statements when the final outcome of the review is adopted by the UN Human Rights Council, which is the only opportunity for NGOs to speak on the floor of the Human Rights Council during the entire UPR process.
