Rwanda: National Commission for Human Rights prepares ground to launch preventive mandate
January 11 2019
Following the entry into force, in September 2018, of the law designating the National Commission for Human Rights (NCHR) as National Preventive Mechanism (NPM), the NCHR is preparing the ground to launch its preventive operations in February 2019. In this context, the APT went to Kigali on 17-18 December to strengthen the NCHR’s capacity to effectively implement the NPM mandate and develop a robust operational plan.During the workshop, the 30 participants – including the seven NCHR’s Commissioners as well as relevant staff members – discussed the strategic priorities of the Rwandan NPM, integrating them into a draft operational 2019-2020 work plan, focusing on the following three areas:Facilitated by the APT, the training workshop represented a good opportunity to enhance their knowledge and understanding of the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention against Torture (OPCAT) and its preventive spirit, as well as to discuss the necessary interactions and synergies between the NPM unit and the other entities of the NCHR.The APT will continue to accompany the NCHR Commissioners and staff in their new mandate, including by helping them build a sound methodology to monitor places of deprivation of liberty, draft preventive recommendations to the authorities, and follow up on their implementation.For more information on:
