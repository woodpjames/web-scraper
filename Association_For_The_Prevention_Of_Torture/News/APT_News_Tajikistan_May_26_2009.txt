OSCE Office in TajikistanRepresentative Office of OHCHR in Central AsiaDepartment for Constitutional GuaranteesRepublican Bureau for Human Rights and the Rule of LawOn 26-27 May 2009 the APT and its partners (see below) co-hosted an international event on independent detention monitoring in the Tajik capital, Dushanbe, the opening of which was attended by around 60 participants. This high-profile two-day event sought to bring together an array of experts from various countries with practical experience in monitoring places of detention, including Armenia, Georgia, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. The exchange attempted to expose the Tajik authorities to a range of monitoring practices and to explore their evolution in countries sharing the same Soviet heritage.In addition, the authorities were also further exposed to the importance of the OPCAT as an important human rights instrument. For this latter purpose Dr Zdenek Hajek of the Subcommittee on Prevention attended the event, while Ivan Selih of the Slovenian Ombudsman’s Office shared his country's experiences of having established a civil society-ombudsperson hybrid NPM model in 2008. In addition, representatives from Armenia, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan informed the Tajik participants about the steps being taken in these countries to put in place NPMs.The 26-27 May event was the first such exchange devoted solely to the OPCAT in the country.The overall aim of the event was to engender a national discussion on independent detention monitoring in Tajikistan between government and civil society representatives. It is relevant to note that, among its various Concluding Observations from November 2006, the UN Committee against Torture had recommended that the Tajik authorities permit national and international independent monitoring of its closed institutions and to consider ratifying the OPCAT. It is hoped that as a result of this and other planned activities the authorities will be encouraged to introduce independent detention monitoring and to consider the ratification of the OPCAT.Later in 2009 the APT plans to organize a follow-up seminar on the same issue.Agenda: English  RussianOSCE Press Release  (Web Link)
