August 19 2010
29 July. In the case of Kopylov v. Russia the ECHR awarded a complainant 105, 000 Euros for non-pecuniary damage for four violations of Article 3 of the Convention. The complainant, Oleg Kopylov, was repeatedly severely beaten in police custody in Lipetsk in the first quarter of 2001 as a result of which he suffered serious, irreversible damage to his health. The Court ruled, among other violations, that the man had been tortured, the investigation into his complaint had not been effective and he had not received sufficient redress.
