NPM peer-to-peer exchange in Latin America
December 4 2012
The APT facilitated a peer-to-peer exchange of experiences between the National Preventive Mechanisms (NPM) of Honduras and Costa Rica.The workshop took place in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, on 26-28 November. This was the opportunity for both NPMs to exchange views on their practices and the challenges they face in their daily work. The report by the Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture (SPT) following its advisory visit to the country in April-May 2012 served as an enriching basis for the discussions. The activity included a joint monitoring visit to the Marco Aurelio Soto Prison, in the outskirt of Tegucigalpa.The peer-to-peer exchange was the first of its kind in the region and will be followed by a similar activity with the same participants in San Jos√©, Costa Rica, during the first quarter of 2013.
