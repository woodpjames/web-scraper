“Shadow monitoring” with new Austrian torture prevention body
November 11 2012
The Austrian Ombudsman together with the Council of Europe co-organized a training on monitoring methodology for the newly created National Preventive Mechanism of Austria.The training included visits to prisons, psychiatric hospitals and social care homes. During the visits, the members of the Austrian NPM were “shadowed” by international experts, including from the APT. Such “shadow monitoring” was followed by enriching discussions on the findings and the methodology applied during the visit.The event took place from 5 to 7 November in Vienna.
