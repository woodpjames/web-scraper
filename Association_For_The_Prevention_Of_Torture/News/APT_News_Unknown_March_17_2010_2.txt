Sixteen NPMs attended the event, which focused on the role of NPMs in preventing torture and other forms of ill-treatment in psychiatric institutions and social care homes.A combination of invited international experts and NPM representatives discussed both the standards which apply to such detention settings as well as how such facilities might be monitored in practice. In doing so, a range of relevant issues were examined including: the specific rights and guarantees concerned with mental health and social care placement; rights and conditions in mental health facilities; psychiatric treatment and after-care; the use of restraints in psychiatric institutions; and mental health issues relating to vulnerable groups such as children and immigrants. In addition, key elements relating to a visit to such detention settings and related best practices were also discussed among the participants.The European NPM Project is unique in that it is the only initiative in the Council of Europe region which regularly brings together European NPMs for the purpose of such peer-to-peer exchanges and which offers NPMs in-country detention monitoring trainings.AgendaDescription of the European NPM ProjectDetailed information about this event can be found at the event websiteMatthew   Pringle, APT Europe & Central Asia Programme OfficerTanya  Norton, APT Detention Monitoring AdviserPhotos courtesy of the University of Padua
