The Conference gathered representatives from Correctional Services from the Asia and Pacific Region to discuss common challenges in balancing human rights demands and effective prison management. The APT was accompanied by Ms Silvia Casale, former Chairperson of the UN Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture. She delivered a keynote presentation during the Conference on why the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention against Torture is a practical tool which could assist the Correctional Administrators in better managing the prisons.
