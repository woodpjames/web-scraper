APT calls on Argentina to urgently adopt law establishing NPM
October 22 2012
Argentina is being reviewed today for the second time under the Universal Peridodic Review (UPR).On this occasion, the APT calls on the Argentinean State to honour its commitment, pending since it ratified the Optional Protocol to the Convention Against Torture in 2004, to create an independent National Preventive Mechanism (NPM), a body whose main function will be the regular monitoring of all places of detention in the country.When reviewed under the UPR for the first time in 2008, Argentina pledged to create this NPM. Four years later, no further delays should prevent the final and prompt sanction, by the Senate, of the bill creating the NPM.
