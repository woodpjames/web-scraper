Brazil: The security and powers of Pernambuco torture prevention body must be guaranteed
August 27 2015
The Association for the Prevention of Torture (APT) is very concerned by the serious incident that took place on 17 August in the prison of Santa Cruz do Capibaribe, Brazil.A team of the State Mechanism to Prevent and Combat Torture (MEPCT), a body established by State law N°14.863 of 7 December 2012, was insulted with racist and transphobic terms and threatened with death by a prison guard who drew his firearm during its monitoring visit to the aforementioned prison. Such behaviour is unacceptable and seriously endangers the security of the MEPCT’ team, as well as the continuation of its important work.For more information, see the APT statement.
