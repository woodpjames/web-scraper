Artists Against Torture
January 30 2007
19 Contemporary Artists engage in the struggle against torture

"Artists against Torture" is a portfolio of modern art. The idea was launched and supported by Madam Martita Jöhr-Rohr, Honorary member of the Board of the Association for the Prevention of Torture (APT). The aim is to contribute to the financing of this international association in its struggle for greater respect for human rights.

In 1993, 19 internationally-renowned contemporary artists offered an original work, specifically created to contribute towards the struggle against the horrible practice of torture. The only restriction imposed upon the artists is that their work of art should be 76 cm by 56 cm. Each of the 19 works of art in the portfolio, which is limited to 150 copies, is signed personally by the artist. Václav Havel, author and former President of the Czech Republic, has written the foreword to this very important portfolio.

To become the owner of one of these prestigious portfolios, and affirm a universally respected humanitarian commitment, please contact:
