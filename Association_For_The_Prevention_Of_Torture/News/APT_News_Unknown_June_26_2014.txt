Africa: taking a step forward in the prevention of torture
June 26 2014
National Preventive Mechanisms (NPMs) in francophone Africa share some common challenges and perspectives when it comes to the prevention of torture. To mark the International Day in Support of Victims of Torture, the Organisation of la Francophonie (OIF) had invited NPMs, government representatives and international experts for a two-day meeting in Paris to discuss the establishment of effective, independent NPMs in Africa.In his introductory speech, the Secretary General of the OIF, Abdou Diouf, reminded the participants about the 2016 African Human Rights Year, as declared by the African Union, and called on States to take concrete steps for effective torture prevention.This message was reinforced by Wilder Taylor, Vice-Chairman of the UN Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture (SPT), who highlighted the crucial role played by National Preventive Mechanisms in the fight against torture.Martine Brunschwig Graf, President of the APT, said that prevention requires joint forces and commitment of all stakeholders. She particularly stressed the role of parliaments, in ensuring the independence of NPMs.Interview with Martine Brunschwig Graf, President of the APT, on TV5 Monde.
