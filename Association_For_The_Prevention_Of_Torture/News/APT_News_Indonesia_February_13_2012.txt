Is Indonesia close to adopt measures to prevent torture?
February 13 2012
Together with its national partners, including the NGO ELSAM, the APT has been promoting the ratification and the implementation of the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention against Torture (OPCAT) since 2005.Advances have been made in the past few years: the ratification of the OPCAT is included in the National Human Rights Action Plan (2010-2014) and background papers and documents were drafted to promote the ratification and implementation of the OPCAT in Indonesia.

The APT will travel to Jakarta to meet with a wide range of actors, including the Working Group Against Torture (a coalition of 12 NGOs) authorities, diplomats and representatives from Human Rights Commissions, to devise the most appropriate strategies to enhance the prevention of torture initiatives in Indonesia. The APT is convinced that the OPCAT has the potential to make a difference in Indonesia on the situation of torture and other ill-treatment.
