Zeid: Time for Tunisia to put its torture prevention body into operation
April 21 2015
The Tunisian transition process is a model for the region and beyond. This was the message from UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra’ad al Hussein, during a visit in Tunis on 20 April 2015.“The prominent place given to human rights in the Tunisian transition has led to its success”, the High Commissioner affirmed.He expressed his appreciation for Tunisia’s leading role in torture prevention and encouraged Tunisia to swiftly operationalise its national oversight mechanism on torture prevention, and to establish an independent national human rights institution.Tunisia acceded to the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention against Torture (OPCAT) following the revolution in 2011. When Tunisia created its independent torture prevention body it became the first country in the Middle East and North Africa region to establish its National Prevention Mechanism by law. However, the members of this crucial oversight body have not been appointed yet.
