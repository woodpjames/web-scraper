August 31 2007
Independent monitoring of places of detention is a relatively new approach to the prevention of torture in the Middle East and North Africa. However, authorities in different states of the MENA region have recently started to allow for independent observers to monitor the respect for human rights inside their prisons and police stations. In other states, NGOs, lawyers and human rights institutions are stepping up their efforts to obtain access to prisons.A seminar held in Amman from 3-6 September brought together organizations involved in detention monitoring, many meeting for the first time.
