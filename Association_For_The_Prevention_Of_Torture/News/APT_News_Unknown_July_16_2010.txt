Lopota v. Russia
July 16 2010
On 13 July the European Court ruled in the case of Lopota v. Russia that the latter had violated Articles 3 and 34 of the ECHR. In the former instance, Russia failed to effectively investigate the applicantâ€™s complaint that he had been ill-treated in police custody in Uchaly in August and September 2000 for purposes of securing a confession. Moreover, the European Court ruled that the man had been intimidated by an official while in prison in January 2004 after he had lodged a complaint with the European Court, violating the right of individual petition.
