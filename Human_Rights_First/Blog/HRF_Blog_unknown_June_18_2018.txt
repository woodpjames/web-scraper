The Trump Administration is Putting Up a "No Vacancy" Sign
June 18, 2018
Reports from across the U.S.-Mexico border show that border agents are once again illegally turning away families seeking protection. Our report, Crossing The Line, exposed this practice in May of 2017. New evidence shows that over the last several months, border agents have begun standing in the middle of international bridges to physically block people from crossing into the United States. They are telling families—who have traveled thousands of miles—that there is no room for them, and that they will have to wait or return home. At some crossings, applicants camp out for weeks before they are able to request protection.
