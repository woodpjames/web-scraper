Background

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), in one of its actions                as new department, has announced that as part of its new “Operation                Liberty Shield,” it will detain asylum seekers from a group                of nations. While the Department has not yet identified these countries,                it is expected that this list will include Iraq, as well as other                refugee producing countries such as Iran, Somalia and Sudan. Ironically,                this plan will in result in the US targeting for detention the very                people who have stood up to, and in some cases been persecuted and                tortured by, the same regimes that the U.S. has singled out for                condemnation. Innocent men and women will be subject to prolonged                detention under this policy.

The Department of Homeland Security “press kit” announces                that: “Asylum applicants from nations where al-Qaeda, al-Qaeda                sympathizers, and other terrorist groups are known to have operated                will be detained for the duration of their processing period. This                reasonable and prudent temporary action allows authorities to maintain                contact with asylum seekers while we determine the validity of their                claim. DHS and the Department of State will coordinate exceptions                to this policy.” The “press kit” is available                at http://www.dhs.gov/dhspublic/interapp/press_release/press_release_0115.xml.

DHS Provides Some Additional Information about the Scope                of the Policy               Arriving Asylum Seekers of Targeted Nations Likely to Face Extended                Detention

The “Operation Liberty Shield” announcement is incredibly                vague. The DHS “press kit” does not provide clear information                about which asylum seekers are affected, at what stage of asylum                proceedings, or which countries are targeted. As a result asylum                seekers and attorneys have not been provided with adequate information                that will allow them to understand who will and will not be subject                to this detention policy.

In response to inquiries, DHS has officially confirmed to  Human Rights First that this detention policy will not be applied to  “affirmative”                asylum applicants (ie, individuals who apply, after  entering the                U.S., affirmatively by filing an asylum application with  DHS). The                detention policy will apply to asylum seekers from 33  countries,                including Afghanistan, Algeria, Bahrain, Bangladesh,  Djibouti, Egypt,                Eritrea, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kazakhstan,  Kuwait, Lebanon,                Libya, Malaysia, Morocco, Oman, Pakistan, Philippines,  Qatar, Saudi                Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Thailand, Tajikistan,  Tunisia, Turkey,                Turkmenistan, United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan and Yemen  as well                as Gaza and the West Bank. DHS has indicated that it is  preparing                a fact sheet that will address the change.

The policy will apply to asylum seekers of the targeted nationalities                who seek asylum at U.S. airports and borders. As a result of a 1996                immigration law, asylum seekers arriving at U.S. airports and borders                have been subject to a summary border procedure (called “expedited                removal”) which is accompanied by “mandatory detention.”                Asylum seekers have been eligible for parole after they are interviewed                by DHS asylum officers and are determined to have a “credible                fear of persecution.” Those that meet the parole criteria                – which include a finding that their identity has been established,                that they have ties to the community, and that they are not a risk                to the community – should be eligible for release –                though, as detailed in prior Human Rights First reports, in various                parts of the country asylum seekers have been refused release even                when they meet these criteria. Human Rights First reports on this                issue:

Find “Refugees Behind Bars” here, and “Refugee Women at Risk” here.

Under “Operation Liberty Shield,” arriving asylum seekers                – even those who meet the parole criteria and present no risk                to the public – will be required to be detained for the duration                of their asylum proceedings if they are seeking refuge from one                of the targeted nations. The announcement does not state that women                and children are exempt. Asylum seekers who have fled from these                nations will therefore be held in U.S. jails and detention facilities                for about 6 months and in some cases for years while they await                the resolution of their cases. Some are survivors of torture and                trauma, and detention significantly exacerbates their suffering.

Fairness Requires Individualized Determinations

This new policy, which targets asylum seekers for detention based                on their nationality, violates principles of fairness and due process                that are enshrined in U.S. and international law. Article 31 of                the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees prohibits                the penalization of refugees when they are forced to resort to “illegal                entry” and requires that the movement of refugees be restricted                only when necessary. The International Covenant on Civil and Political                Rights (ICCPR) prohibits the arbitrary detention of asylum seekers,                and requires that those who are detained have the right to seek                release before a court.1 The policy also runs afoul of international and U.S. law and principles prohibiting discrimination based on nationality.

The policy appears to deprive asylum seekers of an individualized                determination of the need for their detention – and to authorize                blanket detention even for asylum seekers who present no security                risk and who otherwise merit parole. This policy is not only unwise,                but unnecessary. Existing law provides ample authority for the Department                to detain any non-citizen whom it believes may pose a security threat.                The new policy will result in prolonged detention of refugees who                fled torture and mistreatment in their home countries.

The Department of Homeland Security has a critically important                mission of protecting this country from harm. Human Rights First                firmly believes that the Department can protect this country in                a fair and non-discriminatory manner. A good start would be to ensure                that asylum seekers have access to fair and independent procedures                where the need for detention can be determined with respect to each                individual asylum seeker.

Portraying Refugees as Threats to Security 

On March 1, the functions of the INS relating to immigration –                including those relating to asylum seekers and refugees –                were transferred to the new Department of Homeland Security. It                is certainly disappointing that the Department of Homeland Security,                which has just taken on the important obligation of protecting the                vulnerable individuals who seek refuge in our country, has chosen,                as its first major announcement relating to asylum seekers, to take                the drastic step of labeling asylum seekers as threats to security.                This action does not bode well for the fate of vulnerable refugees                whose safety and futures are now in the hands of this new Department.

Jailing the Victims of Saddam Hussein 

Finally, we are deeply concerned about the message that the Department                is sending both to the victims of Saddam Hussein’s persecution                and to the world. By making this announcement, the Department has                declared that it intends to jail for months or longer Iraqis who                seek refuge in the U.S, regardless of whether they have opposed                Saddam Hussein and suffered at the hands of his regime. On the eve                of our war with Iraq, we also fear that this new policy may prove                counter-productive to U.S. efforts to encourage other nations to                extend protection to the hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians                who are expected to seek safety from the conflict in neighboring                countries and beyond.

Take action and urge the Department of Homeland                Security to abandon blanket detention policy and apply fair and                individualized procedures.
