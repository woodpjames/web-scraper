Human Rights First Welcomes Passage of Amendment to Help Iraqi Translators
June 05, 2008
Human Rights First welcomes the signing of S. 2829, an amendment that clarifies Congress’s intent to make 5,000 Special Immigrant Visas immediately available for Iraqi translators and others who supported U.S. efforts in Iraq. The amendment also allows that Iraqi translators who applied for visas under a previous SIV program and were wait-listed due to a shortage of visas can be granted visas under the new program. 

“We hope that there will be no further delay in implementing changes to the Special Immigrant Visa program, and that these 5,000 visas will be used right away to bring Iraqi translators and others currently living under threat to safety in the United States,” says Eleanor Acer, director of Human Rights First’s Refugee Protection Program.
