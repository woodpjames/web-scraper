Holder Hearing Tomorrow: Show Your Support for Federal Courts
March 22, 2010
The Wall Street Journal featured an action alert we issued at the end of last week urging Attorney General Eric Holder - and the administration - to hold strong against fearmongering, stay on track to close Guantanamo and use civilian courts to try suspected terrorists.Thanks to those who retweeted our response to the Journal - it was heard!If you haven't signed our letter to Holder and the White House, you still have time! Holder testifies tomorrow. You can still show your support for federal courts.
