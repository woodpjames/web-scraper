Operation Liberty Shield Quietly Terminated
Future of Detained Asylum Seekers Still Unclear

"Operation Liberty Shield," including its provision regarding                the detention of asylum seekers, has been officially “terminated”                by the Department of Homeland Security. It is not clear however                whether the Department is taking steps to release any asylum seekers                detained under the policy who meet the relevant parole criteria.

Operation Liberty Shield and Asylum Seekers

As Human Rights First detailed in a previous                edition of Asylum Protection News, Operation Liberty Shield was                announced by the Department of Homeland Security on March 17, 2003,                the eve of the war with Iraq. One provision of Operation Liberty                Shield required that asylum seekers arriving from an undisclosed                list of nations and territories be detained for the duration of                their asylum proceedings without the possibility of an individualized                review of the need for their detention. Although the initial announcement                was unclear, the Department of Homeland Security later clarified                that the policy would not apply to so-called “affirmative”                asylum applicants who were already admitted to the US, but instead                to “arriving” asylum seekers who were subject to the                expedited removal process.

Under the policy, even asylum seekers who did not raise any suspicions                of security or flight risks were slated to be confined in jails                and detention centers for the duration of their asylum proceedings                (estimated by the Department to be six months or significantly longer                if the case was appealed) and deprived of a meaningful opportunity                to request release through parole. Targeted asylum seekers were                believed to be those arriving from 33 countries and 2 territories,                including Afghanistan, Algeria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Djibouti, Egypt,                Eritrea, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Lebanon,                Libya, Malaysia, Morocco, Oman, Pakistan, Philippines, Qatar, Saudi                Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Thailand, Tajikistan, Tunisia, Turkey,                Turkmenistan, United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan and Yemen, as well                as Gaza and the West Bank.

Detention Policy Comes Under Fire

In response to the Department of Homeland Security’s announcement                that these asylum seekers would be denied the opportunity to request                release from lengthy incarceration, many legal assistance, advocacy,                and faith-based organizations that work with refugees wrote to the                Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security or issued public                statements expressing their concern. These groups included: Amnesty                International USA, Catholic Legal Immigration Network, the Episcopal                Migration Ministries, the Ethiopian Community Development Council,                the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, Human Rights Watch, the Lutheran                Immigration and Refugee Service, the National Asian Pacific American                Legal Consortium, the US Committee for Refugees, the US Conference                of Catholic Bishops, and the Women’s Commission for Refugee                Women and Children. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees                also publicly criticized the policy citing its letter to the US                Government in which the High Commissioner, Ruud Lubbers, stated:                “Detention of asylum seekers should be the exception, not                the rule, and should be based on an individualized assessment of                the security risk the person poses.” Newspapers and other                media covered the Department of Homeland Security’s announcement                and the concerns of refugee advocates.

In addition, over 430 individuals wrote to Tom Ridge, Secretary                of the Department of Homeland Security, through the action component                on Human Rights First’s website to express their concern                about the extended detention of asylum seekers of the targeted nationalities                under Operation Liberty Shield. Our thanks go to all who took the                time to write in to express their concerns.

Policy is Terminated Quietly

According to information posted on the Department of Homeland Security’s                website during the last week, Secretary Tom Ridge and Undersecretary                Asa Hutchinson of the Department of Homeland Security have both                confirmed that “Operation Liberty Shield” officially                ended on April 17, 2003. Secretary Ridge stated during a                speech delivered to the National Press Club on April 29,                2003, that "Operation Liberty Shield, launched March 17th,                terminated on April 17th." Under Secretary Hutchinson also                confirmed that "Operation Liberty Shield, launched March 17th,                was terminated on April 17th while                addressing the Association of American Chambers of Commerce in Latin                America on May 7, 2003.

Information concerning the termination of this policy was not publicly                posted on the Department of Homeland Security’s website until                last week.

If you are currently representing an asylum seeker from a country                or territory that fell under Operation Liberty Shield, and your                client is still being detained, you should consider renewing your                request for parole of your client (if your client meets the parole                criteria and wishes to seek parole). If your local Department of                Homeland Security officials have told you, or in the future tell                you, that your client cannot be released because of Operation Liberty                Shield, you may wish to cite the above statements by the Secretary                and Undersecretary of the Department of Homeland Security. Please                contact Archi Pyati at Human Rights First Asylum Program if you are told that your                client will continue to be detained.

Continued Detention of Asylum Seekers

While Operation Liberty Shield has been officially terminated, arriving                asylum seekers from the designated countries and territories continue                to be subject to mandatory detention upon their arrival in the US                under the 1996 expedited removal law. Though asylum seekers from                these countries are now technically eligible to apply for parole,                it is not clear how many will actually be released. Parole determinations                in the US appear to have become increasingly restrictive and delays                in routine security checks prolong detention for asylum seekers,                including many who are ultimately granted asylum. For background                information on detention of asylum seekers, please refer to these                Human Rights First reports:"Refugees                Behind Bars"
and "Refugee                Women at Risk".

Meanwhile, as a result of the Attorney General’s sweeping                declaration on April 17, 2003, Haitian men, women and children will                be detained in jails or other facilities for months or years without                being given a meaningful chance to demonstrate that their detention                is unnecessary. To learn more about this situation, and to express                your concern for the discriminatory treatment of Haitian asylum                seekers, please read our April 28 newsletter and take                action.
