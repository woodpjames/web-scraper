Watch our recent panel on detention issues relating to Guantanamo prisoners--covered by CSPAN on Monday.  Human Rights First convened this panel in Washington DC to urge elected officials to forego new legislation on indefinite detention.Sixteen distinguished former federal judges participated, underlining how federal courts have been successful in handling habeas corpus cases for Guantanamo detainees in a way that both addresses the government's interest in national security while protecting the right of prisoners to fairly challenge their detention.The briefing's discussion was largely based on our report, Habeas Works: Federal Courts' Proven Capacity to Handle Guant√°namo Cases. Simply put, the report finds, habeas is working.
