Darfur: Former Political Prisoner Outlines Road Map For Peace
July 27, 2006
Dr. Mudawi Ibrahim Adam, Chair of the Sudan Social Development Organization, has written a proposal for advancing the Darfur-Darfur Dialogue and Consultation laid out in the Darfur Peace Agreement. 
Dr. Mudawi has been repeatedly persecuted and imprisoned by the Sudanese government for his stalwart monitoring of human rights abuses in Darfur. His firsthand knowledge gives this proposal great weight and merits the attention and respect of the international community. 
Dr. Mudawi’s proposal aligns with the two approaches to ending the conflict advocated by Human Rights First:

A reconciliation process involving representatives of all parties and interested groups in the region to ensure long-term peace.  
In order to make that peace possible, we have urged the UN Secretary-General to name a senior envoy to Darfur to focus on bringing the conflict to an end and building a sustainable peace.

About Dr. Mudawi:
Dr. Mudawi’s organization monitors human rights abuses in Darfur, Sudan. Dr. Mudawi was jailed by the Khartoum government three times in 18 months – at times in solitary confinement, without access to a lawyer, his family or medical attention. During one imprisonment, Dr. Mudawi went on a hunger strike for 12 days and was charged with attempted suicide and espionage. He was arrested again on the day he was supposed to travel to Dublin to receive a human rights award from the President of Ireland. Due to international pressure, Dr. Mudawi was released, but the charges against him have not been dropped. Dr. Mudawi has traveled to the US on two occasions; in February this year he met with various UN and State Department officials, as well.
