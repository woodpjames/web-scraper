Human Rights First Statement on 9th Anniversary of 9/11
September 10, 2010
Washington, DC â€“ Today, Human Rights First issued the  following statement marking the ninth anniversary of the terrorist  attacks of September 11, 2001, that resulted in the deaths of nearly  3,000 people.

"On this solemn anniversary, we express our heartfelt condolences to  the families of the victims of 9/11, as well as our unwavering support  for the men and women who continue to guard our freedom and security at  home and abroad.

"This year, we urge our country's leaders and all Americans to honor  the memory and sacrifice of those we have lost by restoring America's  commitment to the rule of law and working to reclaim our nation's role  as a world leader in the struggle for human rights, tolerance and  religious freedom. We must come together to see beyond the fear and  bigotry that have provoked some to use this anniversary as a basis for  political stunts or hateful acts such as the planned "Burn a Koran Day"  in Gainesville, Florida. We support the efforts of the many political,  military, religious, and civic leaders who have denounced acts of  intolerance. We should heed their warning of the danger these activities  pose to our troops, and their inconsistency with our Nation's founding  principles. We urge all to use this anniversary as a time to reflect on  the strength we gain from our differences and challenge our leaders to  fully realize our nation's role as a world leader in the struggle for  human rights."
