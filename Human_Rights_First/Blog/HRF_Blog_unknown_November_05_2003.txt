Asylum Seekers Protest Detention with Hunger-Strike: Complaints Included Length of Detention, Unfair DHS Parole Policies, and Jail-like Conditions
Take          Action Now!  

Asylum seekers at the 200-bed immigration detention center in Queens,          New York recently engaged in a hunger-strike to protest a range of concerns          relating to their detention. The asylum seekers are detained at the direction          of the Department of Homeland Security (formerly the INS) at a facility          run by the Wackenhut Corrections Corporation, under a DHS contract. Among          the concerns raised by asylum seekers and other immigration detainees          was the length of detention, the lack of fair DHS parole practices, and          the jail-like conditions of their detention.

Two of these detainees, Viktor Odnovyun and Oleksiy Galushka, have each          been detained for a total of over 3 years and 9 months by the INS and          now the Department of Homeland Security, despite the fact that an immigration          judge has granted them withholding of removal under the Convention Against          Torture. DHS has refused to parole them while it appeals the immigration          judge’s decision, even though their parole applications are supported          by 28 letters of support from their employers, friends, and fellow parishioners          in Pennsylvania and even though the two men appeared for all immigration          proceedings when they had been previously paroled.

The Wackenhut Hunger-Strike

Asylum seekers who arrive at U.S. airports without proper documents are          detained upon their arrival. Once they pass a screening interview, asylum          seekers are eligible to be paroled if they satisfy certain INS, now DHS,          criteria – criteria which includes community ties, no risk to the          community, and that identity can be established. But even asylum seekers          who meet these criteria continue to be detained, as documented in several          reports issued by Human Rights First.

On Tuesday, October 21, some detainees at the Wackenhut facility in Queens          began refusing to eat meals. According to detainee reports, all male detainees          began refusing meals on Wednesday, October 22 and most began eating again          during the following week, although at least two detainees only began          eating again on November 2nd.

Detainees reported that they were protesting a range of DHS detention          issues, including:

 Detention of arriving asylum seekers with no criminal backgrounds
 Lack of automatic, timely, independent review of the need to detain            each individual
Lack of DHS parole grants even when detainees meet all stated parole            criteria and submit requests with full support, including proof of community            ties
 DHS refusal to release individuals who are granted withholding of            removal relief under the Convention Against Torture or Refugee Convention
The absence of any hope for release while detainees exercise their            due process right to appeal to the BIA and federal court, and the one-sentence            denials now routinely issued by the BIA
Conditions of detention, including jail-like uniforms, inadequate            food, exorbitant phone costs, no meaningful access to fresh air, no            privacy in dorms for bathroom and phone use, and no privacy in visitation            with family and friends

Two Men Detained for Nearly 4 Years 

Viktor Odnovyun and Oleksiy Galushka have been detained for a total of          three years and nine months – first at the Wackenhut facility, then          at York County Prison in Pennsylvania, and now after a period of parole,          at the Wackenhut detention facility again. They are represented pro bono          by volunteer attorneys through Human Rights First’s pro bono          asylum representation program.

The two arrived in the U.S. in March 1999, seeking asylum from their          native Ukraine where they were persecuted by the police, security forces,          and government-sanctioned vigilantes due to their activism in non-governmental          organizations and the political opinions attributed to them as a result          of their activism. They were detained on arrival at the airport because          although they were traveling on their own Ukrainian passports, they lacked          visas for entry to the U.S. They passed their credible fear screening          interviews but continued to be detained – first at Wackenhut and          then at York County Prison. In September 1999, an immigration judge granted          them withholding of removal but denied them asylum because he believed          they had the right to reside in Argentina. After a series of appeals,          the Federal Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit remanded their cases,          as part of a settlement agreement, in connection with which the INS agreed          to release the two men on parole while their remand proceedings continued.

As a result, in late August 2002, after over three years in INS detention,          Viktor and Oleksiy were finally released from jail on parole and settled          in York, Pennsylvania, where they had built up extensive community ties          during their period of detention at York County Prison. Oleksiy volunteered          at York Hospital, while Viktor volunteered his time to International Friendship          House, the home for released asylum seekers where the two had resided          immediately following their release from detention, as well as to the          Orthodox Church of which they are active members. Once they obtained work          authorization, both men found employment at a local restaurant. Viktor          was able to start sending money home for the medical care of his teenage          son, who has been battling cancer in the Ukraine.

Their cases were remanded to the Immigration Judge for new proceedings,          so the two men drove from Pennsylvania to attend their immigration court          hearings at the Wackenhut facility, appearing with their attorneys as          they had promised to do when released on parole. On June 17, 2003, they          attended their final hearing, fully expecting to return to their home          and to their jobs at the conclusion of the hearing. At the time, both          men had additional job offers pending: Oleksiy from the hospital where          he had volunteered, and Viktor from a medical supply firm.

The Immigration Judge granted both men withholding of removal under the          Convention Against Torture. The DHS (ICE) Trial Attorney announced that          she would appeal this grant of relief, and directed that both men be re-detained.          They were both detained on the spot. Their attorneys had to move their          car into long-term parking at JFK Airport until friends from Pennsylvania          could come retrieve it.

Their pro bono attorneys filed a new parole application – supported          by 28 letters of support from their employers, friends, and fellow parishioners          in Pennsylvania. The New York DHS (ICE) denied the parole application          in late September 2003 in a letter that referred to the two men collectively          as "she." As grounds for the denial, the form letter stated:          "Based on the particular facts of your client's case, including manner          of entry, ICE cannot be assured that she will appear for immigration hearings          or other matters as required." The letter ignored the fact that Viktor          and Oleksiy, when previously released on parole, had in fact appeared          for ALL immigration hearings as required by the immigration service. A          request to DHS for reconsideration of the parole denials was recently          denied.

Both Viktor and Oleksiy participated in the hunger-strike at Wackenhut.          They resumed eating on Saturday, November 1 after losing about 20 pounds          each.
