Momentum Grows for the Global Day for Darfur: Events Planned in 18 Countries to Date
August 29, 2006
NEW YORK, NY- On September 17 people in over 15 countries across the world will show their support for the people of Darfur.
Efforts to mark the day are now being planned in Abuja (Nigeria), Addis Ababa (Ethiopia), Berlin (Germany), Cairo (Egypt), Hong Kong, Kigali (Rwanda), Kampala (Uganda), Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia), London (United Kingdom), Melbourne (Australia), Moscow (Russia), Nairobi (Kenya), New York (USA), Paris (France), Pretoria (South Africa), Toronto and Vancouver (Canada).
“We’re all saying the same thing, whether at a small candlelight vigil or mass concert; our governments need to step up now and put an end to the mass slaughter that is going on in Darfur,” said Jill Savitt, Campaigns Director at Human Rights First.
Thousands of people will call on their governments to do more to pressure the Security Council to protect civilians in Darfur including wearing blue hats on the day to symbolize the blue berets that U.N. peacekeeping forces wear. “African Union troops have done what they can under very difficult circumstances, but the time has come for U.N. troops to be sent in to protect the people of Darfur,” said Savitt.
September 17th marks the one-year anniversary of the United Nations' pledge to provide security for civilians around the world. People all over the world will gather to remind the UN of its unfulfilled responsibility and the continuing suffering in Darfur.
