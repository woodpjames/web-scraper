Refugee Resettlement at Record Low
Take          Action Now! 

The U.S. has resettled only 17,439 refugees this year. If the U.S.          does not dramatically improve the pace of its refugee resettlement program,          only 26,000 refugees will be admitted during this fiscal year –          far below the U.S.’s authorized admission of 70,000 refugees and          its pledge to bring at least 50,000 refugees to safety in the U.S. this          year.

Expressing concern for the plight of refugees, on April 9, 2003 members          of the House of Representatives formed the “Bipartisan Congressional          Refugee Caucus” “dedicated to affirming the United States’          leadership and commitment to protection, humanitarian needs and compassionate          treatment to refugees and persons in refugee-like circumstances throughout          the world.”

World Refugee Day Celebrated in June

June 20th marked World Refugee Day highlighting the plight of over 14          million refugees worldwide and focusing specifically on youth. In the          United States, Angelina Jolie, the UNHCR’s Good Will ambassador,          held a press conference with Senators Feinstein and Brownback to show          support for the Unaccompanied Minors Protection Act of 2003. This Act          seeks to ensure that unaccompanied immigrant children are treated humanely          in federal custody and helps those who are entitled to relief obtain such          relief. In celebration of World Refugee Day, Representatives Payne and          Hyde read statements into the Congressional Record commending the governments          of Tanzania, Kenya and Zambia for generously providing sanctuary to the          largest refugee populations in Africa.

At the same time that the U.S. was marking World Refugee Day, the United          States resettlement program, which has annually resettled on average 70,000          to 80,000 refugees, is in dire straits.

Background on Resettlement 

After September 11 the resettlement program came to a complete halt and          did not resume until December 11, 2001. The program was stopped in order          to conduct a security review. Since this three month hiatus, the US resettlement          program has only admitted a trickle of refugees. In fiscal year 2002 President          Bush authorized 70,000 refugee admissions but only 27,100 were admitted,          the lowest number in more than twenty years. This year the number of refugees          admitted has been equally disappointing, totaling only 17,439 currently.          At this rate, at best 26,000 refugees will be admitted during fiscal year          2003. Tens of thousands of refugees will be left living in difficult and          sometimes dangerous circumstances.

Not only has the drastic decline of the US resettlement program since          September 11th had a devastating impact on thousands of refugees, but          it has also greatly hindered the ability of refugee resettlement agencies          to maintain their staff and infrastructure. As a result of low refugee          admission numbers, the largest refugee resettlement organizations have          told their national staffs to expect a 30% cut this year.

See          U.S. Refugee Admissions Program for Fiscal Year 2004

Officials at the US Department of State have continued to maintain that          the US will admit 50,000 refugees before September 30, 2003, the end of          the fiscal year. “We are working very hard to reach that number,”          a State Department spokesperson told the Washington Post in May. See          George Lardner, Jr., U.S. Welcomes Fewer Refugees; ’02 Admissions          Had Ripple Effect in Post-9/11 World, Report Says, Washington Post,          May 20, 2003. But, as the U.S. Committee for Refugees (USCR), has pointed          out, the Department of State remained confident that it would admit 70,000          refugees last year until the week before the fiscal year ended, when in          fact only 27,100 refugees were actually admitted.

Departments of Homeland Security, State and Justice
Should Prioritize and Devote Resources to Resettlement 

The U.S. refugee resettlement program is currently being hampered by          significant delays in the conduct of U.S. government security checks and          a lack of sufficient resources. These problems were detailed in a July          7 article which appeared in the Los Angeles Times. Leonard Glickman,          Chairperson of Refugee Council USA and President/CEO of the Hebrew Immigrant          Aid Society noted "[o]ur country can't seem to get its program back          on track. The first year after Sept. 11, everybody was willing to defer          to the [Bush] administration. By the middle of the second year, people          had had it. If you want to give the management of the program a grade,          it's a D-minus." See Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar, Refugees          on Hold and at Risk, L.A. Times, July 7, 2003.

The Administration should take steps to ensure that adequate resources          are devoted to refugee resettlement and that refugee security checks are          handled on a priority basis. The Administration should also direct the          Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Justice and the Department          of State to treat refugee resettlement as an important priority and to          coordinate their work to ensure the timely resettlement of refugees.

Take Action! Urge Your Congressperson to Join the Refugee Caucus

The Bipartisan Congressional Refugee Caucus can be a powerful force for          advocacy, but it will only be as strong as its membership. The Bipartisan          Caucus has four co-chairs: Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL), Rep. John          Conyers (D-MI), Rep. Christopher Smith (R-NJ), and Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-CA).          The Caucus, through its advocacy and leadership will provide a vital voice          for refugees and asylum seekers in need of protection. Please          write to your Representative urging him or her to (1) join the Bipartisan          Refugee Caucus and (2) write to the President urging him to reverse the          decline in refugee resettlement. If your Representative has already          joined the Caucus, write him or her thanking them for their commitment          to protecting refugees.
