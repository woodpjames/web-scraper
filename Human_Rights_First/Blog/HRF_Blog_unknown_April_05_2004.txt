Detention of Asylum Seekers - A Step Forward, a Step Back
DHS - ICE Issues Guidance Confirming that Asylum Seekers Who are Granted Asylum Should Generally Not be Detained; Also Announces Expansion of Detention in Atlanta and Denver
Take          Action!
Write Ridge to Improve Detention Policies for Asylum Seekers!

This newsletter updates you on three important developments relating to          the detention of asylum seekers:

First, just last week, the Department of Homeland Security's Bureau of          Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) announced in a press release          that it was expanding its use of immigration detention in Atlanta and          Denver. As discussed below, this expansion is expected to affect asylum          seekers in those areas.

Second, on a positive note, ICE recently issued guidance confirming that          people granted asylum or other protection relief by immigration judges          should generally be released from detention when ICE appeals the judge's          decision. This and other new guidance relating to those found deserving          of protection under the Convention Against Torture, is discussed below.

Third, we're asking you to mark your calendars, and help spread the          word about, a Write Ridge day on April 19, the day after the final air          date of the Court TV film, Chasing Freedom.


DHS - ICE Expands Detention Pilot Project to Atlanta and Denver

On March 26, ICE issued a news release announcing the expansion of a detention          pilot project which it had launched last year in Hartford, Connecticut          to Atlanta and Denver. As a result of this expansion, it is expected that          individuals who are denied relief by immigration judges (including asylum          seekers) will be subject to detention at their immigration court hearings.          However, the scope and operation of this project is unclear from the news          release: the ICE news release contains little information about the project,          and may in fact give an inaccurate impression - the news release refers          to the detention of individuals who have been "issued final orders of          removal" even though individuals in Hartford were reportedly detained          even when their deportation orders were not final and were being appealed.

If this project operates like the Hartford project, it will lead not only          to the detention of many individuals who are denied relief by an immigration          judge (including those who are appealing the judge's denial), but also          to the detention of a new category of asylum seekers in Atlanta and Denver.          Previously asylum seekers who had voluntarily identified themselves to          U.S. immigration authorities by applying for asylum have not been detained          during the course of their immigration proceedings. Asylum seekers are          sometimes incorrectly denied asylum by immigration judges. This is why          the U.S. asylum system provides for appeal of immigration judge decisions          to the Board of Immigration Appeals and to federal courts if necessary.

Detaining asylum seekers who have voluntarily come forward to U.S. authorities          is counterproductive. Not only does it discourage refugees from seeking          protection, but it also penalizes asylum seekers for voluntarily identifying          themselves to U.S. immigration authorities. The Executive Director of          the Denver-based Rocky Mountain Survivors Center, Paul Stein, is concerned          that this new project fails to make provision "for those who flee to the          United States in order to escape the heinous crimes committed against          them abroad" and will have a "chilling effect on the asylum process."

The ICE news release makes absolutely no mention of any particular provision          for asylum seekers - raising questions about the extent to which asylum          issues are given adequate attention and consideration within ICE/DHS.

DHS - ICE Guidance on Those Granted Relief

In recent months, the press and human rights organizations have raised          concern about the detention of asylum seekers and others who continue          to be detained even though immigration judges have granted them asylum          or other relief. The press has written about the six-month detention of          a Tibetan nun ("Granted Asylum, Nun Held in Va. Jail," Washington Post,          January 27, 2004), the four-year detention of two asylum seekers who were          granted relief under the Convention Against Torture ("Out of Repression,          Into Jail," New York Times, January 15, 2004), and last year about the          detention of several Haitian asylum seekers ("Haitians are Held in U.S.          Despite Grant of Asylum," New York Times, July 25, 2003). In its January          2004 report In Liberty's Shadow, Human Rights First addressed this          issue and urged that DHS issue regulations making it clear that asylum          seekers who are determined to be eligible for asylum or withholding of          removal should generally be released from detention while an appeal is          pending. Read the report online at: 

ICE has recently issued guidance confirming that individuals who are granted          asylum or other protection relief (such as withholding of removal or relief          under the Convention Against Torture) by immigration judges should generally          be released from detention when ICE appeals the judge's decision. The guidance, contained in a  memorandum from Assistant Secretary Michael J. Garcia of ICE, indicates that release from detention is not favored where there are "exceptional concerns          such as national security issues or danger to the community." To see the          memorandum, dated February 9, 2004 and publicly circulated in late March, click here. At about the same time, on February 12, 2004, ICE issued  additional guidance  clarifying that when immigration judges grant relief          under the Convention Against Torture, ICE attorneys are not required to          reserve appeal in all cases.

Please contact Archi Pyati at Human Rights First if you are representing an asylum seeker or other          individual who continues to be detained in violation of this new guidance.          You should also urge DHS to release your client consistent with the new          policy.


Mark Your Calendars: Write Ridge Day on April 19 to follow Chasing          Freedom

As we previously advised you, on Sunday, April 18 at 3pm, Court TV will          air an encore showing of its original film, Chasing Freedom. The          film tells the story of a young Afghan woman who flees the Taliban and          the pro bono attorney (played by Juliette Lewis) who takes on her asylum          case after the woman is detained when she arrives in the U.S. in search          of refuge. The film was inspired by a real asylum case handled by a team          of dedicated pro bono attorneys for Human Rights First.

We are organizing a Write Ridge Day on Monday, April 19, the day after          the film airs. We are asking for your help in encouraging others to see          the film and in urging those who are concerned about U.S. detention of          asylum seekers to write to Secretary Tom Ridge of the Department of Homeland          Security on April 19 to urge him to make some changes to improve the treatment          of asylums seekers detained in the United States. If you would like to          help spread the word about this effort, please contact Carline          Bennett at Human Rights First. And please, mark your calendars.          We'll be sending you additional information about this effort soon.

You can also make a difference by forwarding this message to your friends          and colleagues and urging them to take action as well.
