Justice Department Decision Fails to Restore America's Credibility
November 09, 2010
Washington, DC – Following the Department of Justice's  announcement that no criminal charges will be filed against CIA  personnel for destroying videotapes of interrogations of terrorism  suspects, Human Rights First's Dixon Osburn issued the following  statement:

"Accountability is essential to restoring America's credibility as a  nation of legal principle and a leader in human rights. We are  disappointed that the Justice Department has chosen not to pursue  charges in this case, but remain hopeful that the still pending Durham  investigation into the actions of CIA interrogators and contractors  involved in abusive interrogations will ultimately provide a full, fair  and objective review of allegations of illegal conduct."
