Firstcast: podcast on Burn a Koran day and anti-Muslim bigotry
September 10, 2010
This week's podcast takes a closer look behind the big story this week, the infamous “Burn a  Koran” media blitz. The story of this single reverend with a 50-person  congregation follows on the heels of Muslim-bashing and fearmongering  over the Park 51 Islamic center and the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks  this weekend.

Fortunately world leaders have spoken up against this trend. President  Obama spoke strongly against the wave of intolerance in his press  conference today. He also praised George W. Bush for having spoken  clearly in favor of tolerance during his presidency.

Human Rights First has an open petition to former President Bush to speak up--we have over 9,000 signatures and  we’ll be moving next week to spread this message to other world  leaders. Join our efforts!
