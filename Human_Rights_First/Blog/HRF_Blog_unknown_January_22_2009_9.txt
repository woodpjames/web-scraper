Statement From 16 Retired Admirals And Generals, Who Have Been Working Through Human Rights First, On Meeting Today With President Obama To Discuss Executive Orders Banning Torture And Closing Guantanamo
January 22, 2009
"President Obama's actions today will restore the moral authority and strengthen the national security of the United States. It is vital to the safety of our men and women in uniform that the United States never sanction the use of interrogation methods that we would find unacceptable if inflicted by an enemy against captured Americans.

We commend President Obama for acting quickly through these executive orders to enforce a single standard of humane treatment for all U.S. intelligence interrogations. As Commander in Chief, he has provided clarity throughout the military chain of command.

By unequivocally rejecting torture and other cruel and inhumane treatment, shutting down secret prisons, providing Red Cross access to prisoners in U.S. custody, rejecting the legal opinions that facilitated and excused torture, and announcing the closure of the Guantanamo Bay prison, President Obama has rejected the false choice between national security and our ideals. Our Nation will be stronger and safer for it."
