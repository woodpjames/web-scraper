Statement in Response to Release of Torture Memos from Vice Admiral Lee Gunn  (Ret.),  Lieutenant General Charles Otstott (Ret.), and Rear Admiral John Hutson (Ret.)
April 16, 2009
We are three members of a larger group of dozens of retired generals and admirals who have worked over the past four years to restore U.S. adherence to humane treatment standards.  We believe the Obama Administration made the right decision in releasing the Office of Legal Counsel memos on interrogation this afternoon.  Airing the facts about past mistakes is essential to ensuring that the right policies are in place to prevent future abuses while making our country stronger. The authorization and use of the so-called "enhanced" techniques was counterproductive and our nation is made more secure by President Obama
