Senator Shaheen: United States Should do More to Address Refugee Crisis
November 04, 2015
By Megdi Abebe In a recent article for TIME, member of Senate Foreign Relations Committee Jeanne Shaeen (D-NH) criticized the U.S. government for not taking in a significant number of refugees to aid the global refugee crisis. The world is facing the largest refugee crises since WWII, with more than four million people displaced due to the conflict in Syria. The Obama Administration has so far only committed to providing asylum for a small fraction of refugees who need it. Senator Shaheen referenced the Syrians she met on the Greek island of Lesvos and their personal, troubling stories. “The Syrians I met on the Greek island of Lesvos had survived a harrowing odyssey. Nearly a quarter million of their countrymen have been killed, and some four million have fled the country. They are escaping unspeakable violence, hunger and a homeland that no longer offers any hope for their children. They have endured barrel bombs, chemical attacks, indiscriminate shelling and the barbarity of ISIS. To reach Europe, they have been preyed upon by traffickers—including criminals who sell refugee children for sex, for slavery, or for organs. They have risked drowning at sea and suffocation in locked vans,” wrote Senator Shaheen. The senator emphasized that although Europe should take more responsibility, the United States is not entirely free of the burden. The United States has a history of showing leadership during these times of crisis, offering refuge to many affected by horrific world events from Nazi genocide to civil war in Rwanda and Darfur. “[W]e must not allow Europe to stand alone at this time of crisis. As the leader of the Atlantic Alliance, the U.S. owes our allies generous support and partnership. It’s time for a more robust U.S. response to the greatest humanitarian challenge of our time,” added Shaheen. To read more, click here: http://time.com/4088963/refugee-crisis-u-s-role/
