Live from Guantanamo
September 22, 2009
Human Rights First's International Legal Director Gabor Rona is in Guantanamo all week monitoring military commissions. He writes about his Guantanamo impressions in this Huffington Post piece - "A Day in the Life of Guantanamo Military Commissions."He speaks of the prosecutor's request that defendants be forced to come to the courtroom (they were boycotting the proceedings) with the bemused observation:If the logic of forcing the accused to come to court in order to have them statewhether or not they wish to be there escapes you, welcome to the absurd world ofGuantanamo Military Commissions! My guess is that the prosecutor's plea had moreto do with a desire to quash the defendants' protests than with concern fortheir rights.  This is Guantanamo, and military commissions. Gabor calls us back to reality with the striking conclusion on the easier way to prosecute suspected terrorists:With all this fur flying chaos afoot, is it too much to expect that thosein power will come to their senses? That they will remember we have federalcriminal courts with jurisdiction over war crimes, terrorism and all mannerof bad behavior; that we have secure prisons from which no one escapes; andthat we have a system of civilian justice that is the global gold-standardand that if used, would deprive these would-be warriors their desiredmartyred status as victims of a judicial lynching.Read more about Human Rights First's work on why we should prosecute these cases in federal courts.
