Bully
February 02, 2017
There’s a name for the child who picks on the weakest kid in hopes of getting attention. He’s a bully. Thirteen days into his presidency, to keep the spotlight on himself, Donald Trump has repeatedly targeted the most vulnerable people in the world: refugees. Last night he hung up on the Prime Minister of Australia. But we all heard his message loud and clear. Donald Trump will put “America First” by making sure the weakest people in the world come last. That’s not leadership, it’s bullying. Here are the facts: Of course, bullies aren’t interested in facts. But we all know how to deal with a bully. First, you stand up to him. Second, you call for assistance from responsible adults. That’s the role we need members of Congress to step up and play; as a separate and co-equal branch of government, Congress can block Trump’s Muslim ban in its tracks. Demand that it do so.
