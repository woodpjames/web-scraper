Refugees blocked from entering the United States; quota to be cut
Since September 11, the flow of refugees into                the United States has virtually stopped, blocking as many as 20,000                refugees who had already been exhaustively investigated and fingerprinted                as a prerequisite to being granted refuge. There are two reasons                for the virtual moratorium: security concerns, and the fact that                the White House has not yet set a new annual quota for refugees.                Worse, it seems that President Bush may follow the trend of the                Clinton Administration, by cutting the quota down to 70,000. By                comparison, the U.S. admitted 200,000 refugees a year during the                Reagan

Administration. Anti-terrorism Legislation

In the wake of the horrific September 11 bombings,                the Bush administration sought greatly increased power to summarily                detain non-citizens, and proposed a bill that would have allowed                for indefinite detention of any non-U.S. citizen, without charge.                On October 26, after a month of negotiations, President Bush signed                the USA Patriot Act of 2001, which would allow the Attorney General                to detain any non-citizen suspected of involvement in terrorism,                for up to seven days without charge, a longer period of detention                without charge than U.S. law has ever allowed. After seven days,                if the detainee is not released the government must bring either                criminal charges, or charges of an immigration status violation.                Detainees could still be held for long periods after that, if the                U.S. government finds that it cannot deport them (for example because                their country of origin will not take them back). We will be vigorously                monitoring the Attorney General's use of his broad new power especially                since, even without it, he has detained nearly 1000 people since                September 11 without bringing criminal charges against any of them                as far as we know.

The Refugee Protection Act

As you know, in 1996 Congress made a number                of negative changes to our immigration law. One change jeopardizes                those who seek asylum in the United States. Before the new law took                effect, all asylum seekers had access to a procedure that afforded                them basic due process - the right to present their cases before                an immigration judge. Under the new system of "expedited removal"                begun in 1996, INS inspectors at an airport or border port now have                the power to make life or death decisions previously entrusted to                judges. Expedited removal allows the immediate deportation - without                a hearing - of those who arrive without valid documents, as many                asylum seekers are forced to do. INS inspectors can even summarily                deport persons whose documents the inspector suspects were obtained                under false pretenses. These procedures are so summary and lacking                in safeguards that mistakes are inevitable. The 1996 changes to                immigration law also subject asylum seekers to mandatory detention.                Those who are not immediately turned away are often imprisoned for                weeks, months, and even, sometimes, years before they are granted                asylum or deported.

In 1996 a number of refugee protection and human                rights organizations worked together to oppose expedited removal.                Since then, Washington representatives of those groups and others                have been informally working together seeking passage of legislation                to end or limit the use of expedited removal. Out of that effort                came the Refugee Protection Act, first introduced in November 1999                during the last Congress. As described below, an expanded Refugee                Protection Act was recently introduced in the Senate.

Prospects for Passage of the Refugee                Protection Act

Because of the 9/11 attacks it has not been                possible to affirmatively lobby Congress on the Refugee Protection                Act this fall. Before the attacks, introduction of the Refugee Protection                Act was expected in the House in October. That will not be possible                until the second session of the 107th Congress, which begins in                late January of 2002. Because of the great progress made in building                support for the Refugee Protection Act prior to 9/11 and because                asylum seekers have thus far not become an issue in the attacks                or the debates over measures needed to prevent further attacks,                it may be possible to move the Refugee Protection Act forward during                the late winter and spring of next year.

Refugee Protection Act introduced in                the Senate, after successful hearing

The Refugee Protection Act was introduced in                the Senate in August, as S. 1311. Original sponsors are: Sen. Sam                Brownback (R-KS), Sen.Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Sen. Jim Jeffords (I-VT),                Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-MA), Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME), Sen. Richard                Durbin (D-IL), and Sen. Bob Graham (D-FL). Sen. Paul Wellstone (D-MN)                is a co-sponsors.

On May 3, the Senate Immigration Subcommittee                held a hearing at which several refugees testified in such a moving                way that the eyes of then Subcommittee Chairman Senator Sam Brownback,                (R-KS), filled with tears. Patrick Mkhizi, one of three refugees                who testified, described how he watched the killing of his father,                and how he was separated from his mother and sister, whom he hasn't                seen since, and then explained that when he arrived in the United                States and attempted to seek asylum, he was summarily put on a plane                back out of the country. He was saved from deportation, he said,                only because the airplane crew refused to take off with him on board                - but then he spent three and a half years in detention in the United                States. He is now working as an auto technician and going to school.                It was when Mkhizi spoke of having been recently selected as "employee                of the month" and "student of the month" that Sen. Brownback was                particularly moved.

Detailed description of the Refugee                Protection Act

The Refugee Protection Act would reverse several                unjust provisions of immigration law that were enacted in 1996,                especially "expedited removal," under which Immigration and Naturalization                Service officers can summarily expel non-U.S. citizens who arrive                in the United States without travel documents, or with documents                that the INS officers suspect are fraudulent. (Many people fleeing                repressive governments are forced to travel without papers, either                because they flee in haste, or because the persecuting governments                will not issue them documents.)

Specifically, the Act:

Ends the use of expedited removal, except in cases of 'immigration                  emergency' declared by the Attorney General.
 Provides procedural protections when expedited removal is used                  during an immigration emergency, to make it less likely that refugees                  will be wrongly turned away.
Makes it less likely that an asylum seeker will be imprisoned                  upon arrival in the United States. The Act states that asylum                  seekers may be detained when necessary, but that detention is                  not mandatory, and asylum seekers may be paroled while their claims                  are reviewed. At the moment, many asylum seekers are handcuffed                  and sometimes shackled to benches as soon as they arrive, and                  then detained - sometimes for a period as long as several years                  - while their applications are being considered.
 Promotes the use of alternatives to detention.
Provides for review by an immigration judge of a decision to                  detain an asylum seeker who requests parole. Eliminates the current                  one-year time limit on applying for asylum.

Building Support for the Refugee Protection                Act

Sign On Letter: Just before the 9/11 attacks                a joint sign on letter was about to be delivered to the offices                of Senators who are not yet sponsors of the Refugee Protection Act                urging them to sponsor. The letter is from a large numbers of national,                state, and local organizations. If your organization has not signed                on and you may want to do so, email Gene Guerrero and ask for a                copy of the letter. The letter will be delivered to Senate office                early next year.

Op-ed Campaign: For the past several months                a number of organizations have been working together to have op-eds                supporting the Refugee Protection Act appear in newspapers across                the country. As a result of this effort so far about 20 op-eds,                columns, or editorials have appeared. These are enormously helpful                in showing Members of Congress that there is significant support                for refugee protection across the nation. Regular conference calls                are held to coordinate this effort. Sample op-eds are available                as are media professionals who can help edit and place the op-ed                pieces. What we need are people around the country who can sign                such op-eds - former refugees, refugee advocates, prominent people,                etc. For further information or to help email Gene Guerrero.
