HRF Applauds Candidates' Rejection of the 'Ticking Time Bomb' Scenario
September 26, 2007
"It's great to hear the candidates discusing how to put an end to policies that leave the door open to torture. It is also heartening to see that candidates are focused on the real challenges of confronting terrorism, not on hypotheticals like the ticking time bomb scenario, " said Maureen Byrnes, Executive Director of Human Rights First. "It is important that the next commander in chief has the best information when making crucial decisions of national security. That several of the candidates said they are listening to the views of those who have served in our nation's armed forces, including retired senior military officers, is a welcome sign. Americans and our troops in the field cannot wait for an end to policies authorizing official cruelty."
