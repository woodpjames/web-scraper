Former Illinois Governor Wants Guantanamo Closed
November 23, 2009
Former Illinois Governor James Thompson published an op-ed in the Chicago Tribune yesterday urging that Guantanamo be closed. He joined the ranks of many other reputed politicians and experts, as he attests:Respected military leaders from Gen. Colin Powell, Gen. David Petraeus and Defense Secretary Robert Gates to Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham to diplomats such as Henry Kissinger, James Baker and Condoleezza Rice all believe Guantanamo Bay must close.I agree.It hurts our image abroad because it highlights that we aren't practicingat home what we are preaching abroad. We make our country stronger and safer bybringing these detainees to justice on American soil.If you agree, sign our petition today!
