Art Spiegelman cartoon in Washington Post cites Human Rights First report
June 22, 2009
Check out this Art Spiegelman cartoon in the Washington Post on refugees. It cites a recent Human Rights First report on the detention of asylum seekers.In this visual commentary, Spiegelman uses the familiar character from his graphic novel, Maus, to look back on how we treated refugees in 1939 â€“ notably the refusal of the U.S. to grant entry to 900 Jews fleeing Nazi Germany. Spiegelman connects this to the present with a compelling visual - a "free orange jumpsuits and handcuffs" sign next to the Statue of Liberty - and a reference to our report on detention conditions for refugees seeking asylum in the United States.
