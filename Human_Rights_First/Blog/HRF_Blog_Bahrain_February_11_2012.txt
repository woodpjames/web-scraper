The Bahrain monarchy recently denied Brian Dooley and other international observers entry to monitor the protests surrounding the anniversary. The Kingdom also denied entry to many international journalists including Nick Kristof and Adam Ellick of the New York Times, Gregg Carlstrom of Al Jazeera, Cara Swift of the BBC and Kristen Chick of the Christian Science Monitor.

Nevertheless, Human Rights Firsts will continue to provide updates from our partners in Bahrain. Stay tuned for daily recounts of the protests.
