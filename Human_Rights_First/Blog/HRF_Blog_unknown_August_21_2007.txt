Is there a loophole in the American Psychological Associationâ€™s anti-torture resolution?
August 21, 2007
Does the new resolution passed by the American Psychological Association on the interrogation of detainees contain a loophole allowing psychologist to continue to participate in brutal CIA interrogations?  Mark Benjamin surveys the criticism directed at the new policy in Salon. What's at stake with the APA's role was made clear when President Bush signed a new executive order last month reauthorizing the CIA interrogation program: The White House emphasized that all interrogations would be overseen by medical officials, as a way of ensuring the safety of prisoners. Since doctors and psychiatrists have ruled themselves out as professional groups, that leaves the psychologists to do the work. And some of them worry that the APA's latest position will still allow the abuse of detainees psychologically, so long as the pain doesn't last too long.
