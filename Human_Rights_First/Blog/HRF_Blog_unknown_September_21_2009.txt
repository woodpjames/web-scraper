Hate Crime in Russia: Rethinking Crime and Punishment
September 21, 2009
Fourteen neo-Nazi youths are on trial in St. Petersburg for deliberately and systematically killing eight people in what appear to be hate crimes.Human Rights First's Paul LeGendre commented on the case in the Huffington Post today - a piece co-authored with Alexander Verkhovsky, a prominent human rights advocate in Moscow. They explain why the case is important, and what Russian authorities can do to help.Why is this trial so crucial?
