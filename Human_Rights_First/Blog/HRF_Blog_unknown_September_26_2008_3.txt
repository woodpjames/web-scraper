Obama-McCain Agree: End Torture
September 26, 2008
STATEMENT FROM Elisa Massimino, Executive Director of Human Rights First:
"It was heartening to see both Sen. Obama and Sen. McCain recognize that America needs to put an end to torture and abuse. Unlike four years ago, when this crucial issue was ignored in the presidential campaign, we now know we can look forward to a change in policy that will improve our national security and bolster our moral authority.
We look forward to working with the next president to uphold American law that requires an end to torture and cruel and inhumane treatment of all American prisoners."
Human Rights First has convened more than 40 retired admirals and generals and more than two dozen retired intelligence and interrogation officials to work to end the torture and abuse of prisoners.
