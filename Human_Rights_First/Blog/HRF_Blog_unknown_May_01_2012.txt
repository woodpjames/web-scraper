Melina Milazzo on Torture Debate: “Release the Torture Report!”
May 01, 2012
The torture debate is heating up once again with the release of Hard Measures, a book by former Director of the CIA Clandestine Service Jose Rodriguez. Rodriguez claims in his book that torture saved American lives. Well, torture proponents were wrong last year and they continue to be wrong this year. Human Rights First’s Melina Milazzo went on Al Jazeera English to debunk Rodriguez’ false claims and on Current TV’s Viewpoint with Eliot Spitzer to talk about the legality of Bush-era torture policies. The facts are clear: top level officials including Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, CIA and FBI interrogators, and retired admirals and generals have publicly said that torture did not lead to bin Laden and that its use risks U.S. national security. In addition, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI), under the leadership of Senator Dianne Feinstein, has nearly completed a 3-year long review–culminating in a 5,000-plus-page report—of the CIA’s post-September 11 detention and interrogation practices.  Feinstein and Senator Levin, Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, yesterday took issue with Rodriguez’s claim that torture led to bin Laden. Melina argues that, in order for the United States to move forward and create policies based on facts, the SSCI should release its report. Take action: Tell the SSCI to release the torture report!
