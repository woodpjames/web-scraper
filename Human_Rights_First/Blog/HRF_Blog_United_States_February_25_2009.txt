President Obama: "The United States of America does not torture."
February 25, 2009
President Obama addressed Congress last night, February 24, 2009:To overcome extremism, we must also be vigilant in upholding the values our troops defend – because there is no force in the world more powerful than the example of America. That is why I have ordered the closing of the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, and will seek swift and certain justice for captured terrorists – because living our values doesn’t make us weaker, it makes us safer and it makes us stronger.  And that is why I can stand here tonight and say without exception or equivocation that the United States of America does not torture.In words and deeds, we are showing the world that a new era of engagement has begun.
