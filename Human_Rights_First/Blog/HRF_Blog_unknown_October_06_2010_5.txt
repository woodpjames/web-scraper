Federal Judge Issues Witness Ruling in Ghailani Trial
October 06, 2010
New York City – Today, U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan's  barred the testimony of a government witness whose identity was obtained  through torture in the case of Ahmed Ghailani. Human Rights First's  Daphne Eviatar, who was at the court and is monitoring the trial, issued  the following statement:

"Judge Lewis today upheld a longstanding principle of the rule of  law, barring testimony derived from the torture of the defendant.  The  issue here is not that the testimony has been barred, but that the  defendant was tortured.  The fact that Judge Lewis recognizes that  evidence derived through torture is inadmissible only strengthens the  view that civilian federal courts, not military commissions, can best  handle difficult terrorism cases.  Just yesterday, a federal court  sentenced the Times Square bomber to life in prison.  Let's be clear –  the barred testimony in the Ghailani case is not the only evidence that  the government will present in this case.  The government convicted four  of Ghailani's alleged co-conspirators in the same federal court,  without the testimony of this particular witness. Judge Lewis' decision  is significant, though, because it clearly signals that the court will  not countenance evidence derived from torture."

Ghailani is accused of assisting the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies  in East Africa that killed 224 people and wounded hundreds more. He is  the first former Guantanamo Bay detainee to be tried in a civilian U.S.  federal court.
