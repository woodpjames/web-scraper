Hicks Plea Illustrates Problems with Military Commissions
March 30, 2007
"From the beginning, the Hicks proceedings have illustrated everything thatâ€™s wrong with these military commissions. The plea deal in particular has the taint of coerced statements. The deal effectively censors anything Mr. Hicks might allege about what he says he suffered and implausibly characterizes the last five years of his detention as justified under the laws of war. 
"Add in the widespread perception that the plea deal was in part the result of intense political and diplomatic pressures, and the conclusion is inescapable that these military commissions don't deal justice, they deny it."
