Celebrating Human Rights Day
December 10, 2010
On this day in 1948 the United Nations General Assembly endorsed  the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and its conclusion that, "recognition  of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members  of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the  world."

But today in Oslo, Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo's seat stood empty. He is in a Chinese jail. The Chinese government successfully  pressured 15 nations to boycott the reception honoring his work for free speech  and elections. The mission of Eleanor Roosevelt and countless others who worked  tirelessly to make the Declaration a reality is not yet complete.

Today is a day to remember what the Universal Declaration stands for  and to honor some of those dedicated individuals who have championed its  principles. Who and what inspires your commitment to human rights?
