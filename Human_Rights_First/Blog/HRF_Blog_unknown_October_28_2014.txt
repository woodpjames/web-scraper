Pro Bono Week Round-Up
October 28, 2014
On this day in 1886, President Grover Cleveland dedicated the Statue of Liberty in the New York harbor. Originally a gift from France, the statue became a symbol of hope for immigrants and refugees leaving their home countries to find safety and a better life. People are still making a dangerous trek to America today in search of protection. Last week we celebrated Pro Bono Week by honoring the attorneys that give their valuable time on behalf of asylum seekers and by sharing the stories of those they represent. Check out our “Lawyers Making a Difference” blog series, featuring posts by Human Rights First’s Hardy Vieux, Michael Joseph of Blank Rome LLP, Kia Grant of Ropes & Gray LLP, and Cara Vasquez of DLA Piper in Houston. Below, watch the stories of Parvaneh from Iran and Awoke from Ethiopia as a part of our Refugee Voices project:  Parvaneh, from Iran  Awoke, from Ethiopia
