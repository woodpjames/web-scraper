“Moms Just Like Me”
May 08, 2015
In this video Human Rights First Vice President for Development Mary Hedahl discusses her visit to a detention center in Karnes, Texas holding mothers and their children who fled violence and persecution in Central America. What struck her most, Mary says, is that “They were moms just like me who saw that their children were being threatened, that their lives were being threatened…. I looked at them and thought, ‘I would have done the same thing.’ Any mom would have.” Detention re-traumatizes already distressed and vulnerable families in need of help. This Mother’s Day, take some time to consider the plight of the moms locked up in immigration detention. You can sign our petition, follow us on Facebook, and read our factsheet to learn more.
