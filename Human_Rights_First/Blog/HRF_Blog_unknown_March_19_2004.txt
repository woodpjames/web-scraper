Viktor and Oleksiy Released!
Continued Action Needed in Support of Detained Asylum Seekers
Take          Action Now!
Write          Ridge to Improve Detention Policies for Asylum Seekers!

On Monday, March 8, Viktor Odnovyun and Oleksiy Galushka, refugees seeking          asylum from persecution they faced in the Ukraine, were released on bond          from the Queens Contract Detention Facility (formerly Wackenhut Correctional          Corporation Detention Facility). Viktor and Oleksiy had each been detained          for a total of nearly four years. They are currently living in Pennsylvania          amidst their friends and colleagues in their community while awaiting          the result of their case.

On November 5, 2003 we asked you to take action on behalf of Viktor and          Oleksiy by urging Secretary Ridge to release them and to improve detention          policies for asylum seekers. You responded – hundreds have participated          in our online and postcard campaign to Write Ridge since early December.          Along with Viktor and Oleksiy, we thank you and urge you to continue making          a difference by making your voice heard.

If you haven’t already participated in our online action campaign          to urge Ridge to improve detention policies for asylum seekers, do so          now by visiting our website.

You can also make a difference by forwarding this message to your friends          and colleagues and urging them to take action as well.

Background on Viktor and Oleksiy and the Detention of Asylum          Seekers

Viktor and Oleksiy were each detained for a total of nearly four years,          first at the Wackenhut facility, then at York County Prison in Pennsylvania,          and then again at the Wackenhut facility. They are represented pro bono          in their asylum claim by volunteer attorneys through Human Rights First’s          pro bono asylum representation program.

The Department of Homeland Security had denied Viktor and Oleksiy’s          requests for parole despite the fact that an immigration judge had granted          them withholding of removal under the Convention Against Torture while          it appealed the immigration judge’s decision. This denial was issued          even though Viktor and Oleksiy’s parole applications were supported          by 28 letters of support from their employers, friends, and fellow parishioners          in Pennsylvania and even though the two men appeared for all immigration          proceedings when they had been previously paroled.

Viktor and Oleksiy’s story was highlighted in the New York Times          in a January 15, 2004 article entitled “Out of Repression, Into          Jail.” The article reported that “detention for … asylum-seekers          has become increasingly automatic, arbitrary and open-ended since the          Department of Homeland Security absorbed the Immigration and Nautralization          Service last year.”

Under a draconian immigration law passed in 1996 and policies which have          become increasingly restrictive since September 11, 2001, asylum seekers          arriving in the U.S. are subject to an “expedited removal”          process, are automatically detained and are often denied parole. The decision          to deny parole is entrusted to the Department of Homeland Security (formerly          the INS), and cannot be appealed to an immigration judge or an independent          authority.

In January 2004, Human Rights First released a new report entitled In          Liberty’s Shadow: U.S. Detention of Asylum Seekers in the Era of          Homeland Security. The report highlights the plight of refugees who arrive          in the United States seeking asylum only to be detained in jail-like conditions,          and urges Secretary Ridge and the Department of Homeland Security to make          the necessary changes to improve detention policies.

Court TV Film Airing Again on Sunday April 18 – Sheds Light          on the Detention of Asylum Seekers

“Chasing Freedom,” an original Court TV Film which first          aired in January 2004, tells the story of a young Afghan woman (played          by Layla Alizada) who is persecuted by the Taliban for running a school          for young girls and the pro bono attorney (played by Juliette Lewis) who          reluctantly takes on her asylum case after the woman is detained when          she arrives at a U.S. airport in search of refuge.

The film was inspired by a real asylum case handled by a team of dedicated          pro bono attorneys for Human Rights First. It is a sobering depiction          of the nearly insurmountable obstacles that asylum seekers face when they          arrive in the U.S.

The movie’s next airing date is Sunday April 18, 2004 at 2:00 PM          on Court TV. To learn more about the film, visit our website.
