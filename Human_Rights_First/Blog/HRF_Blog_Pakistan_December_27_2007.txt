Bhutto Assassination a Tragedy for Pakistan and the Rule of Law
December 27, 2007
"Human Rights First sends its condolences to the family and friends of Benazir Bhutto and all those killed in today's attacks. Today's assassination is a great tragedy for the people of Pakistan and all who care deeply about a return to democracy and the rule of law. At a time when many in Pakistan questioned whether free and fair elections were likely, today's assassination provides tragic evidence of how much work Pakistan must do to achieve this goal," said Maureen Byrnes, Executive Director of Human Rights First. 
Byrnes just returned on December 14 from a trip to Pakistan where she spoke with lawyers, judges and human rights activists about the upcoming elections in Pakistan.
