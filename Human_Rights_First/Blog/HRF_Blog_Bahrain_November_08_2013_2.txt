Congressional Briefing: A New Way Forward for U.S. Government Engagement with Bahrain
November 08, 2013
Representative James McGovern (D-MA), Human Rights First and the Stimson Center will host a November 15 Congressional briefing on the human rights situation in Bahrain and a new way forward for U.S. government engagement with the Kingdom. The 10 a.m. event will feature a new report issued by Human Rights First titled: “Plan B for Bahrain, What the U.S. Should Do Next.” Long-term simmering tensions,  increasingly violent protests, a rise in sectarianism, a relentless government crackdown on dissent and the ruling family’s failure to deliver political reform all raise crucial questions for the U.S. government’s role in the country – not least how best to protect its Fifth Fleet. U.S. policy has been inconsistent since widespread protest began in February 2011, and the U.S. often appears conflicted about how to pursue U.S. interests. This briefing will propose ways to promote human rights and U.S. interests in Bahrain and will address growing security concerns for the Fifth Fleet base in Manama. Co-Sponsored By
