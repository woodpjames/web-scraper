About the Film


Getting Out explores the reality that for many LGBTI Africans coming out to family and friends at home is not even an option. Before they can come out, they first have to get out. This means not only finding means to escape the political forces promoting homophobia at home, but also dealing with the hypocrisies and failings of asylum systems around the world.

Filmed in Uganda, South Africa, Geneva, and London, with supporting footage from Malawi and Zimbabwe, Getting Out depicts the true stories of five individuals navigating their way through this complex issue. The 60-minute documentary was produced by the Refugee Law Project in collaboration with the Ugandan Civil Society Coalition on Human Rights & Constitutional Law.
