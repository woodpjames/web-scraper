Transfer Shows: Prisoners Still Held in CIA Program, Now without Congress’ Support
March 14, 2008
Human Rights First’s Washington Director Elisa Massimino released the following statement in response to the recent announcement that Muhammad Rahim was transferred from the CIA interrogation program to the U.S. military detention facility at Guantanamo Bay Cuba. 
The transfer today to Guantanamo of another prisoner reportedly held for months in a secret CIA prison is just the most recent reminder that the Administration is employing detention and interrogation methods that Congress has voted to eliminate. Last Saturday the President vetoed a bill that would have brought this program in line with the Geneva Conventions, as required by the Supreme Court. The CIA “enhanced” interrogation tactics have included frigid temperatures, sleep deprivation, waterboarding and stress positions – methods rejected by the military as violations of the laws of war. We would never accept such abuses were they used by the enemy against captured Americans. Congress must step up its oversight of the CIA program and force an end to the use of torture and other inhuman methods of interrogation by all US personnel. 
Those who commit terrorist acts, such as those that are alleged to have been committed by the transferred detainee Muhammad Rahim, should be held accountable for their crimes. The secret detention and abuse of detainees impeded this important objective, and the sooner it is ended, the sooner those who have committed these heinous crimes can be brought to justice.
