Justice Department Announces Investigation into Torture Authorization
February 22, 2008
Statement from Elisa Massimino, Human Rights First’s Washington Director.
The Justice Department’s decision to investigate the authorization of the use of torture is welcome news. Those responsible for giving the green light to waterboarding and other illegal acts such as the use of stress positions, sleep deprivation and hypothermia betrayed our nation’s values and undermined our global leadership. It’s time they were held accountable. A thorough investigation and public report by the Department of Justice will be a first step toward putting this disastrous practice of official cruelty behind us.
