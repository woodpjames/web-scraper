Knickers in a Knot
June 05, 2008
Yesterday, Congressman Rohrabacher contributed his usual thoughtful, insightful analysis to the Congressional debate -- this time on the issue of torture and official cruelty.  According to the AP, "In a debate Wednesday about detainee treatment at Guantanamo Bay, the California Republican cited panties eight times."  Hmmm . . . Mr. Rohrabacher previously has spoken out in favor of making prisoners "pick the fruit," now he thinks they should be wearing women's underwear on their heads?  It keeps getting stranger.  And, as Congressman Delahunt reminded Rohrabacher about the Congressional hearing, "This isn't about panties on the head.  This is about physical pressure, waterboarding and other techniques that apparently were utilized at Guantanamo."[[{"type":"media","view_mode":"media_large","fid":"3","attributes":{"class":"media-image","typeof":"foaf:Image","height":"266","width":"320","style":""}}]]
