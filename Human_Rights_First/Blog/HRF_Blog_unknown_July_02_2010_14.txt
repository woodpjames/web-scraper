Asylum News–April/May 2010 Eliminate   the Arbitrary One-Year Bar to Asylum Human Rights   First, along with 86 other faith-based, human rights, legal services   and refugee assistance organizations and 81 individual asylum law   practitioners, pro bono attorneys, law professors and other experts,   sent a letter to members of the U.S. House of Representatives urging   them to support H.R. 4800, the Restoring Protection to Victims of   Persecution Act, eliminating the one-year deadline for filing asylum   applications.  The one year deadline is a technical requirement that has   led to the denial, rejection, or delay of thousands of requests for   asylum protection in the United States and created unnecessary   inefficiencies in the asylum adjudication process. Read the letter. Read HRF's press release and our recommendations). Read the Restoring Protection to Victims of Persecution Act).          USCIS   Ombudsman: Recommendations on Resettlement Adjudications The U.S.   Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman issued a set of   recommendations to improve the adjudication of emergent or denied   refugee applications. The Ombudsman made three primary recommendations   for USCIS:   i) publically state the criteria by which it expedites   certain emergent refugee cases and how to access the expedited process;     ii) clearly state the reason for denying a refugee application; and     iii) issue guidance on how to file a Request for Reconsideration for a   denied application.

Many have had their resettlement applications   delayed, often due to the extended delays in the inter-agency security   clearance process. These and other Iraqi refugees are facing increasing   difficulties as their savings run out. In addition to stressing that the   United States should recommit itself to ensuring adequate funding for   assistance programs in the region, Human Rights First recommended   reforms to the U.S. resettlement system, including improved staffing,   timeliness, and coordination of the security clearance process; detailed   denial letters so that refugees can submit meaningful appeals; and a   fast-track process for refugees at imminent risk of physical harm. Read a blog post by HRF researchers, Jesse Bernstein and   Parastou Hassouri, for specific recommendations.   Naturalization   Ceremony & Refugee Act Commemoration On March   30th, USCIS swore in as U.S. Citizens 27 refugees from Asia, Africa, and   the Middle East.  This special naturalization ceremony commemorated the   30th Anniversary of the Refugee Act of 1980, the bipartisan bill that   established the legal framework for the U.S. refugee and asylum systems   and affirmed the U.S. commitment to providing refuge to victims of   religious, political, ethnic and other forms of persecution.
