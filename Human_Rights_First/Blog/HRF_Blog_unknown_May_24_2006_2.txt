The Prosecution Rests
May 24, 2006
The prosecution moved a lot more swiftly than had been anticipated and finished its case today.  Dave Dishneau of the AP reports on some of the events from today.

Word from Human Rights First attorney Hina Shamsi is that Maj. Gen. Geoffrey Miller is expected to testify today.

Check  in later for more reports on his testimony.  Miller would be the  highest ranking officer to testify to date in a detainee abuse case and  his account will hopefully shed light on what he recommended be  authorized in interrogations at Abu Ghraib and what sort of  directives/orders he received from officials in the Pentagon, including  from Secretary Rumsfeld.
