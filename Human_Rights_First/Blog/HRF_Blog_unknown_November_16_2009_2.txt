Debate on Trying Terrorists
November 16, 2009
Jim Benjamin, one of the co-authors of Human Rights First's In Pursuit of Justice reports, participated in a debate on the best way to try terrorist suspects, in the New York Times' Room for Debate.He draws on his research to underline the excellent track record of federal courts:I recently co-authored a study of the experience of federal courts inadjudicating terrorism cases. The data we collected shows that federal-courtterrorism prosecutions have generally yielded just, reliable outcomes that havenot undermined our national security.The list of convictions includes not only the trial of Omar Abdel Rahman in1995, but also of Ramzi Yousef, Zacarias Moussaoui, Jose Padilla, John WalkerLindh and Richard Reid, to name just a few. Not all cases have been perfect, butthe outcomes, by and large, have been accepted around the world and haveconsigned the convicted terrorists to spend many decades or the rest of theirlives in the obscurity of federal prison.On courts, as a proven system vs. new legal structures:One of the great strengths of the federal courts as a venue for prosecutingterrorists is that they have actually worked, as evidenced by the long list ofsuccessful terrorism prosecutions over the past 20 years.By contrast, proposals to create a new national security court raisepractical and legal questions and offer, for the foreseeable future, theprospect of constitutional uncertainty and legal wrangling. The prioradministration tried and failed to create novel legal structures to handleterrorism cases.Read the whole debate, including the Glenn Sulmasy's perspective.
