August 20, 2009
Maj. Gen. Doug Stone issued a report that calls for the release of as many as 400 detainees from the Bagram detention facility in Afghanistan. Read the story in NPR, which quotes HRF's Sahr MuhammedAlly, who has received a briefing from the general on his report:'I think Gen. Stone's recommendations focus a lot on how to process peopleout of Bagram sooner,' she says. MuhammedAlly says Stone also urges reforms tothe detention system 'to reduce chances they will join up with the insurgency byoffering skills training programs and rehabilitation programs.'
