June 09, 2009
New York City The following statement was issued by Human Rights First Chief Executive Officer Elisa Massimino as terrorism suspect Ahmed Ghailani has been transferred for prosecution before a federal court in New York:

"The decision to bring Ahmed Ghailani into federal court to face justice is an important first step toward the goal shared by General Petraeus, Secretary Gates, and others concerned with U.S. counter-terrorism efforts: closing Guantanamo and denying al-Qaeda of its most effective recruiting poster.Â  Former prosecutors and national security experts agree that our courts are able to bring terrorist suspects to justice without sacrificing our safety. If repeated, this demonstration of confidence in our federal courts will make our country more secure."
