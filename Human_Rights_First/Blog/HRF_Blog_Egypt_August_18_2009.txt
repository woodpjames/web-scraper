Mubarak's visit in Washington: a chance for human rights in Egypt
August 18, 2009
Read Human Rights First's Neil Hick's piece in the Huffington Post reflecting on the Obama Administration approach to Egypt, and looking back at some of Bush Administration policy.He advises:President Obama should seek assurances from President Mubarak that: theforthcoming elections will feature credible independent supervision of theelection process, especially in view of the fact that 2007 amendments to theConstitution have removed the judiciary from its former supervisory role; thatthe basic rights of the independent civil society activists to monitor andcomment on the elections will be upheld; and, that the rights of oppositioncandidates to contest the elections free from harassment and officialobstruction will be respected. President Obama should urge President Mubarak toinvite reputable international election monitoring organizations to conductevaluations in Egypt that would assist in identifying problems, support the workof local monitors and lay the groundwork for further improvements in the yearsahead.
