Listen: General Krulak Discusses Human Trafficking on the Hannity Radio Show
August 29, 2014
In a recent appearance on the Sean Hannity Show, General Charles C. Krulak, President of Birmingham-Southern College, calls on the U.S. government to make human trafficking a bigger priority. Approximately 21 million people are victims of human trafficking worldwide, and exploiters make an estimated $150 billion in profits. General Krulak emphasized that human trafficking is a horrific problem not just overseas but here in the United States. Our country is both a destination and source of victims. American policymakers and law enforcement, says Krulak, should make a much greater effort to target and disrupt the networks profiting from the business of trafficking: “The first thing I’d do is I’d go after the big fish. These are criminals of the worst kind—they are people who make major profits from slavery. We need to get much better at finding them and disrupting the networks that make the profits. The way you do that is like anything else, you follow the money. Human trafficking leaves a money trail. We need to follow that trail and dry up the profits. And more people in government and law enforcement need to make this a bigger focus. We have great people in law enforcement. I was with the FBI in Birmingham yesterday, hearing what they are doing in this area, but they are stretched thin. What we have to remember that we are talking about slavery, this is slavery in the 21st century in the United States, and slavery of the most terrible kind.” Human Rights First is working with General Krulak to combat trafficking and bring justice to the perpetrators of these heinous crimes.
