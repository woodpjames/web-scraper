Uganda Now: Gearing Up for Another Round with the "Kill the Gays" Bill
July 20, 2011
Photo of Frank Mugisha of Sexual Minorities Uganda (SMUG)The “Kill the Gays” bill in Uganda (where homosexuality is already a crime) would impose the death penalty for a second conviction of consensual sex between two people of the same gender. It would also require family members, medical personnel, clergy and others to report people they suspect of being gay or face prison time.
