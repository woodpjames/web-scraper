Iraq's Refugees - Not Disappearing
September 14, 2009
Are we at risk of taking our eyes off the ball? Sen. Richard Lugar (R-IN) is quoted in this morning's Washington Post on the Iraq war asking just that question. The paper's editorial page urges the Obama administration to continue to focus attention and resources on an Iraq that's far from stable, even as it prioritizes other foreign policy concerns.We'd like to highlight one important component of the United States' obligations in Iraq that the Post left out: the 2 million-plus Iraqis who have fled their homes since the beginning of the war remain in dire straits.HRF welcomed the appointment of Samantha Power to coordinate the administration's efforts affecting Iraq's displaced. It's crucial that the United States continue to lead the international response to the humanitarian crisis unleashed by the war - through aid to the region, ongoing resettlement of the most vulnerable Iraqis, and diplomatic efforts to ensure that Iraqi refugees return to Iraq only under safe, voluntary, and dignified conditions.
