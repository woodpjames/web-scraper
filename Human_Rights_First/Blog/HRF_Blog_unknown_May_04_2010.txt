Mirandizing the Times Square Terror Suspect
May 04, 2010
The arrest of Faisal Shahzad, the suspect of the attempted bombing in Times Square, has sparked debate on "mirandizing" terrorist suspects.The FBI issued a statement on how they proceeded, in cooperation with the New York police department. Providing Miranda warnings is not only in line with our Constitution but also desirable if we would want to convict terrorists later. Our federal courts have proven capable of trying tough terrorism cases.Experts from the retired military agree.  The following statement can be attributed to Brigadier General James P. Cullen, USA (Ret.):In the fight against terrorism, our laws and values are our best assets. Our federal courts have shown time and again that they are up to the task of trying terrorist suspects. Those who question Miranda or suggest stripping suspects of their citizenship fail to understand that the rule of law is the best defense we possess, and the weapon that brings the most people to our side. We should challenge anyone who suggests we ignore what makes us the strongest.Brigadier General James P. Cullen, USA (Ret.) is a retired Brigadier General in the United States Army Reserve Judge Advocate General's Corps and last served as the Chief Judge (IMA) of the U.S. Army Court of Criminal Appeals. He currently practices law in New York City.
