Pushing back on anti-Muslim Bigotry
September 23, 2010
As September 11th approaches, a wave of anti-Muslim bigotry is sweeping the country. From "Burn a Koran Day" to anti-mosque protests, hate-filled rhetoric is spreading.General David Petraeus, the top military commander in Iraq and Afghanistan, recently gave Americans a reason to not burn Korans when he remarked that activities such as these pose a threat to our troops. We need others--our leaders and you--to push back on the bigotry.Here's what we've done--and how you can help:We support the interfaith movement showing religious solidarity and tolerance, not bigotry. And we joined forces with Muslim Advocates to warn against a potential growth in hate crime and calling for protection of the muslim community.We asked our supporters to submit their reason NOT to burn a Koran--submit yours!–and will soon post the top ten reasons on our website and widely online. We are promoting a free bookmark online protesting book burning! Share with your networks!With November midterm election campaigns gearing up, Human Rights First has been busy organizing meetings between retired military leaders and political candidates, educating them on the challenges that America faces when we demonstrate discrimination and prejudice, both in our military commissions at Guantánamo and our opposition to the “ground zero mosque”. We are asking that candidates from both sides of political spectrum speak out against these activities, as well as petitioning former president George Bush to reaffirm his commitment to supporting religious tolerance. Human Rights First Tad Stahnke writes that in 2002 President Bush famously said “America treasures the relationship we have with our many Muslim friends, and we respect the vibrant faith of Islam which inspires countless individuals to lead lives of honesty, integrity, and morality.” Let us work together in asking the former president to repeat his message today.
