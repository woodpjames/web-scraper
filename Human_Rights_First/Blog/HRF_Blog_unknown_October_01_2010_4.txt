Human Rights First Welcomes Creation of Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Assembly and Association
October 01, 2010
Washington, DC – Following an announcement that the Human  Rights Council has established the first-ever Special Rapporteur on  freedom of assembly and association, Human Rights First's President and  CEO, Elisa Massimino, issued the following statement:

"Freedom of assembly and association are bedrock rights essential to  democracy and civic action. Yet in many places around the world,  governments are restricting the rights of their citizens to meet, to  form organizations, and to pursue joint action demanding respect for  fundamental rights. That's why it is so important that the Human Rights  Council has established a mechanism to monitor these rights, so that  when governments abuse them, the international community is on notice  and can respond. We welcome the leadership of the United States at the  Council in pressing this agenda forward.

"So much depends on the freedom of civil society to organize and  operate without intimidation and threat. When governments abuse the  rights of their people, civil society groups are often in the best  position to quickly sound the alarm and call for redress. This new  Special Rapporteur’s work should complement the work being done by the  Special Rapporteur on Human Rights Defenders to ensure that the vital  voices of civil society are heard."
