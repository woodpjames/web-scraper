Statement on International Roma Day
April 07, 2009
"Today, more than ever, it is important to celebrate Europe's largest minority on International Roma Day by making a commitment to protecting the human rights of Roma. Discrimination, marginalization, and scapegoating of Roma communities continue to fuel violent attacks against individuals. Government leaders must respond by speaking out against hateful rhetoric, condemning violent attacks when they occur, and ensuring that the perpetrators of senseless, racist violence are brought to justice," said Paul LeGendre, the Fighting Discrimination Program Director at Human Rights First.
