As International Hate Crimes Escalate, Human Rights First Urges Senate to Strengthen U.S. Laws
June 04, 2009
Washington, DC Human Rights First (HRF) is urging the U.S. Senate to pass legislation that would strengthen protections against hate crimes throughout the nation and abroad. According to a letter sent to Senators today, passage of the Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act (S. 909) would fortify existing laws by permitting federal authorities to assist local and state governments in hate crimes investigations, a step that enables the United States to demonstrate its commitment to fighting hate crimes at home and lead by example abroad.
