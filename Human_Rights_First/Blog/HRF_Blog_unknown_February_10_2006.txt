Human Rights First Calls On President Bush and Secretary General Annan To Use Upcoming Meeting To Develop Initiatives To End Darfur Conflict
February 10, 2006
In Letter, HRF Urges Bush and Annan to Express Support for High-Level UN-Appointed Envoy to Darfur 
Human Rights First today sent a letter to President Bush and to Secretary-General Kofi Annan urging them to use their upcoming meeting on Monday, February 13, to develop initiatives aimed at ending the Darfur conflict, which is becoming increasingly dire. 
Specifically, HRF urged President Bush and Secretary-General Annan to support the appointment by the United Nations, of a prominent public figure as an envoy to lead the diplomatic process. This envoy would provide new impetus for advancing the diplomatic process, and enhance the prospects for a political resolution of the conflict. 
Approximately two million people have been displaced from their homes. Hundreds of thousands of people are cut off from any kind of humanitarian assistance. The murderous attacks on civilians continue. If the conflict is not resolved, the tragic violence and displacement of civilians will continue to escalate.
