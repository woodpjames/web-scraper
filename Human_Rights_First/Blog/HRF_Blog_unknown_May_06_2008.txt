Looks like we may finally be starting to see Congress demand some accountability from the Bush Administration for its use of torture.  From Reuters:A Democratic-led U.S. congressional panel voted on Tuesday to authorize its chairman to subpoena Vice President Dick Cheney's chief of staff in its probe of possible U.S. torture of suspected terrorists.Rep. Jerrold Nadler, a New York Democrat, may issue a subpoena as early as Wednesday for David Addington, who the administration maintains is immune from being required to testify.Mr. Addington has previously stated that he will testify if subpoenaed.
