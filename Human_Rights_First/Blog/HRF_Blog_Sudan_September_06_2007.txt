HRF Statement on Naming of Suspected War Criminal as Chair of Sudanese Human Rights Investigative Committee
September 06, 2007
“By naming Ahmad Harun, a suspected war criminal, to investigate human rights violations in Sudan, the Khartoum regime has demonstrated its contempt for the victims of mass atrocities in Darfur. Harun’s appointment is not only a complete travesty of justice, it also represents a personal affront to U.N. Secretary-General Ban, who met with Sudan’s President Bashir only days ago and remains in the region. Harun should not be investigating human rights complaints; he should be surrendered immediately to the International Criminal Court, which accused him of directing massacres in Darfur and issued a warrant for his arrest earlier this year.”
