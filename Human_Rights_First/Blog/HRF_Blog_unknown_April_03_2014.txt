Vote Declassifies Torture Report
April 03, 2014
Great news! The Senate intelligence committee voted today 11 to 3 to declassify significant portions of the torture report. We could not have done this without you. Thank you for helping us push forward on this important issue! The torture report allegedly documents that the CIA repeatedly lied to Congress, the Justice Department, and the White House about the effectiveness of the torture program. Its release should help end the debate on torture. Despite today’s victory, our work isn’t over. Significant portions of the report will now go the White House for declassification review – a process that determines what information will be redacted (and hidden from the public). Given the CIA's clear conflict of interest, Human Rights First has asked President Obama to direct his White House staff to lead the declassification process. It doesn’t make sense to allow the agency assessed in the report the power to decide what parts of it the American people should see. Help us get the message to President Obama.

Now, we're making sure that Americans are informed about the reality of the torture program so that our country never again returns to a policy of official cruelty.
