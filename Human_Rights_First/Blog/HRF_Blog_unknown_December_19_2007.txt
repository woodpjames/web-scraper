Another DOJ Nominee Refuses to Comment on Waterboarding
December 19, 2007
Today in the Senate, the man nominated to be Attorney General Mukasey's deputy at the Department of Justice started trying to impress his prospective boss before he'd even gotten the job.  Asked if waterboarding is a form of torture, Mark Filip replied that he didn't want to "get out in front of [Attorney General Mukasey] on that question."Another sad example of the Bush Administration's torture litmus test in action.
