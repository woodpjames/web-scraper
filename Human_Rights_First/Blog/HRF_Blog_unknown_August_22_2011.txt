Ten Years On - What have we learned from 9/11?
August 22, 2011
Ten years ago, the September 11th attacks shook America to its core. In the aftermath, we stood together as a nation. We received support and sympathy from all over the world. But in the past ten years there have also been missteps: Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo, violations of the rights and freedoms we hold dear. As the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks approaches, Human Rights First would like to hear from you about how does the spirit of resilience and community that grew out that tragedy continues to guide the nation.

Please record a short (under five minutes) video of your thoughts on what our nation has learned from 9/11, what values keep us going, and what positive lessons we can learn from our response to those events. Use your cellphone or your webcam to record your response and then email your video to 911video@humanrightsfirst.org. You can also make a video response on YouTube. These responses will then be incorporated into a video that Human Rights First will release to commemorate the 10th anniversary.

Thanks you in advance for making your voice heard and participating in this project.
