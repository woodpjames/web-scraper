Bankrupt Slavery: Disrupting the Business of Human Trafficking Campaign Launch
January 30, 2015
 On January 31, 1865, the U.S. House of Representatives ratified the 13th Amendment abolishing slavery. Today, 150 years later, there are an estimated 21 million people enslaved. These people are working in industries from construction to agriculture, as domestic workers, and in brothels.  Human trafficking is now the fastest growing criminal enterprise in the world, bringing in more than $150 billion a year. But the human cost is far greater. Human Rights First is launching a campaign to bankrupt the business of human trafficking. By commemorating the 150th anniversary of the ratification of the 13th Amendment, we are joining prominent leaders from the business and financial sectors, law enforcement, the military, federal, state and local government, and civil rights community to call for new policies and resources to dismantle the business of modern slavery. We must develop a multi-sector approach to reverse the risk-reward equation for perpetrators. Through cooperation between the U.S. government, private sector, and civil society, we will press for increased prosecutions and more robust criminal asset forfeiture proceedings, targeting all the enablers and participants in this criminal enterprise.
