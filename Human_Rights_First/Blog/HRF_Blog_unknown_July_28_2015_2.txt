Government Petition Appealing Guantanamo Conviction Overturn is Unnecessary
July 28, 2015
The Obama Administration submitted a petition yesterday seeking a rehearing before the full U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit. The administration wants the court to overturn a three-judge panel’s decision, issued more than a month ago, in al-Bahlul v. United States. The court ruled that the military commissions used to try Guantanamo detainees cannot try them for domestic crimes, including conspiracy. The panel ruling dealt a new blow to the military commissions, making it impossible to use them to try Guantanamo detainees for crimes that do not violate the international law of armed conflict. The administration’s latest petition for a rehearing en banc is likely doomed since the odds are against gaining a majority in the government's favor. Given the slim chance of success, there is no good reason for the government to pursue such a petition. It’s a stall tactic, putting off seeking certiorari before the Supreme Court. The al-Bahlul decision demonstrates further that the federal courts are the appropriate place to try detainees held at Guantanamo. Instead of stalling in an attempt to salvage jurisdiction for the military commissions, the government should acknowledge the failure of Gitmo’s “justice” system. Federal courts have successfully tried more than 500 cases related to international terrorism since 9/11. In comparison, military commissions have convicted only eight people since 9/11, and four of the convictions were overturned on appeal.
