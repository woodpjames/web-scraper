Congress Moves to Block Guantanamo Closure
December 14, 2010
Call or write your senators now!

Congress is working right now to block transfers of  Guantanamo  detainees to the United States, for any reason—including  trial. The  House already voted on a provision that would obstruct  efforts to bring to  justice Guantanamo detainees suspected of crimes.

Federal courts have convicted over 400 terrorists since 9/11.  Military commissions have convicted 5. Congress is moving to rule out  the surest way to get justice for 9/11.

Human Rights First is urging its supporters to call or write their senators to oppose ANY provision that tries to block federal court trials  for Guantanamo detainees.

The House voted on this provision just last  Wednesday. We joined a  coalition of rights groups calling on Senators  to oppose this provision, and  mobilized our allies from the retired military to do the same. Congress needs also to know that their constituencies  strongly oppose any attempt  to obstruct trials of Guantanamo detainees  slated for prosecution. Read more about how the this happened--and why  it shouldn't--in a recent post by HRF's Daphne Eviatar: Pundits Punch and Congress Cows.

It's been two years since President Obama  promised to close  Guantanamo and we all hoped to put this mess behind  us. We've encountered  resistance, fearmongering, and other  challenges—but this bill could actually  prevent him from moving forward  altogether. Let's not let that happen.
