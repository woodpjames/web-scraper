HRF Statement on Suicide of 4th Guantanamo Detainee
June 02, 2009
U.S. military officials have disclosed the fourth suicide of a Guantanamo detainee. Muhammmad Ahmad Abdallah Salih was a prisoner there for 8 years. His death is a stark reminder of the inhumanity of indefinite detention without charges or trial and of the need to both shut the Guantanamo detention facility and to provide detainees with due process of law that has for so long been denied them. Otherwise, the injustice of the Guantanamo system will continue to divert attention from bringing terrorism suspects to justice and to complicate the efforts of the Obama administration to turn the page on the failed policies of the Bush era.
