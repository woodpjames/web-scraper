Stop Idling Formula 1--Don't Give Bahrain the Grand Prix
June 02, 2011
Tell CEO Bernie Ecclestone to set F1 on the right track and cancel the Bahrain Grand Prix.

Tomorrow, Formula 1 officials will decide whether to award Bahrain the chance to host the Grand Prix. But the Bahraini government continues to stage a violent crackdown on pro-democracy activists that has left countless victims detained, injured, or dead.

Tell Formula 1: Don't disappoint world fans by being on the wrong track. Cancel the 2011 Bahrain Grand Prix!

Formula 1 auto racing is one of the most-watched sporting events in the world, with over half a billion viewers last year. This year's spring season was set to open with the Bahrain Grand Prix, but the crackdown caused F1 to postpone its 2011 race. F1 needs to send the right message to the Bahraini regimeâ€”that the world does not stand with repressive governments.

Authorities will decide tomorrow, June 3, whether to grant Bahrain a delayed 2011 race. Continuing attacks on peaceful protesters show that Bahrain is incapable of hosting a major international sporting event and should not be rewarded for abusing human rights. Granting the Grand Prix to a repressive regime will disappoint F1 fans everywhere. It should not turn a blind eye to torture, disappearances, and deaths of peaceful protesters.

Sign the petition and send a message to CEO Bernie Ecclestone. Tell him to set Formula 1 on the right track by canceling the Bahrain Grand Prix.
