Taking on the Ugandan Anti-Homosexuality Bill
December 09, 2010
Help LGBT people at risk of violence 



David Bahati, the Ugandan parliamentarian who introduced the Anti-Homosexuality Bill--legislation that proposes the death penalty for certain cases of "aggravated homosexuality," is in the United States this week for meetings. Paul LeGendre, Human Rights First's Fighting Discrimination program director,  debated Bahati on Voice of America yesterday. Watch the clip after the jump.



LeGendre stressed:
The rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex people are fundamental human rights. And this bill in a fundamental way violates those rights by discriminating against people based on sexual orientation and gender identity through imprisonment and execution.
In response to Bahati's claim that the bill defends families, LeGendre protested and said that the bill "breaks up families and society through bigotry and discrimination." Watch the full debate:
