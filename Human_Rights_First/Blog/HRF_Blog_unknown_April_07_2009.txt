HRF Reacts to Release of ICRC Report
April 07, 2009
"The Obama administration must ensure that the torture and cruel treatment documented in the ICRC report are never repeated," said Devon Chaffee, advocacy counsel for Human Rights First. "The President has stated that--according to the facts--policies of official cruelty have not made us safer. In order to close the chapter on past abuse, the administration needs to provide the public with a complete accounting of the strategic consequences of such practices on U.S. national security."
