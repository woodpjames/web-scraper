McCain Rebukes Giuliani on Waterboarding Remark
October 26, 2007
From the New York Times:Rudolph W. Giuliani’s statement on Wednesday that he was uncertain whetherwaterboarding, a simulated drowning technique, was torture drew a sharp rebuke yesterday from Senator John McCain, who said that his failure to call it torture reflected his inexperience.“All I can say is that it was used in the Spanish Inquisition, it was used in Pol Pot’s genocide in Cambodia, and there are reports that it is being used against Buddhist monks today,” Mr. McCain, who spent more than five years in a North Vietnamese prison camp, said in a telephone interview.
