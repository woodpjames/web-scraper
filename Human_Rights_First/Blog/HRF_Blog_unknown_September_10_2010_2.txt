Are Obama and Biden Inviting Bush to Speak Out?
September 10, 2010
This week, President Obama and Vice President Biden both lauded several  aspects of George Bush's tenure as the Forty-Third President of the  United States. They praised his consistent honoring of U.S. troops and  his post-9/11 outreach to and unequivocal stance in support of the  Muslim community.

Today, President Obama responded to the growing wave of anti-Muslim rhetoric by issuing a plea for  religious tolerance in a passionate speech that also mentioned George  Bush's accomplishment. Obama said that "One of the things that I most  admired about President Bush was, after 9/11, him being crystal clear  about the fact that we were not at war with Islam."

Vice President Joe Biden went on the Colbert Report earlier this week and thanked Mr. Bush for his commitment to the United States military. "You deserve a lot of credit, Mr. President," Biden said.

Do these reflections by Biden and Obama open the door for President Bush  to speak out for religious tolerance on the upcoming anniversary of  September 11th? As Americans have slipped into a divisive debate over  the U.S. position vis-Ã -vis the Muslim world and, alarmingly, the place  of Muslims in the American society, President Bush's reaffirmation of  tolerance and inclusion would have an added weight.

Nine thousand Americans co-signed Human Rights First's Open Letter to President Bush, asking him to stand up against bigotry and hate. The  blogosphere is likewise filled with calls for him to reappear on the  public scene and address the controversy surrounding 'burn-the-Koran'  day or the 'Ground Zero mosque'. There's an opportunity here for George  Bush to be a real 'uniter' -- he should take advantage of it. Not only  the Muslim community, but the entire U.S., is waiting for him to do so.
