The jury deliberates
May 31, 2006
Both prosecution and defense presented closing arguments yesterday and the jury began deliberations, which continue today.Â  At the March trial of Sgt. Michael Smith, with whom Sgt. Cardona is accused of conspiring, the jury deliberations took  18 hours, so a verdict could come as early as today.
