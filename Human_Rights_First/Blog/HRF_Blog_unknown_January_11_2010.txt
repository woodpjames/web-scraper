On the 8th Anniversary of the Opening of Guant치namo
January 11, 2010
Eight years ago today, the first detainee was transfered to the prison at Guant치namo Bay, Cuba. Human Rights First issued this statement, and has launched a campaign to get as many signatures on our petition to close the facility. Human Rights First CEO Elisa Massimino recommends:The Obama Administration should work closely with Yemeni officials toaddress current security concerns and to minimize potential risk beforereinstating transfers there. With all transfers the administration can andshould take steps to mitigate risk by focusing on expanding risk assessmentefforts, monitoring, and other security programs, including allotting sufficientresources to successfully reintegrate former detainees into society.To fully restore the rule of law and rebuild strained relationships with foreignallies, the Administration must also commit to driving the number of detaineesheld without charge down to zero and to pursuing timely federal criminalprosecutions of those alleged terrorists who remain at Guant치namo.You can help make sure the facility gets closed: sign our petition and send us a picture. We'll put you in our video!Learn more: get the facts on Guant치namo.
