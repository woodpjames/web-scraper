Bombs Targeting Christians in Baghdad Fuel Refugee Concerns
November 10, 2010
Washington, DC – In the wake of a series of Baghdad bomb  explosions targeting Christians, Human Rights First's Eleanor Acer  issued the following statement highlighting concerns about Iraq's  minorities and Iraqi refugees:

"These recent attacks raise renewed concerns about the safety of  religious and other minorities in Iraq, as well as the ability of the  Iraqi government to protect its people from violence. Iraqi leaders  should take immediate steps to protect religious and other minorities  from violence and threats.

"For the many Iraqis who have already fled from their homes, these  violent attacks are vivid reminders of the tenuous security situation  and targeted violence in Iraq.  These dangers may exacerbate the  existing concerns that many refugees have about the potential for  returning back home to Iraq.  It is more important than ever for the  United States to continue to lead the international community in  ensuring that the needs of Iraq's refugees and displaced people are met,  including through maintaining a robust resettlement program for at risk  Iraqi refugees. In addition, the U.S. and the international community  should be prepared to address all possible scenarios, including an  increased exodus from Iraq."

Since the sectarian violence that erupted in February 2006 following  the Samarra Mosque bombing, approximately 1.5 million people remain  internally displaced within Iraq. As of May 2010, another 225,000 Iraqi  refugees had registered with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees  (UNHCR) in Egypt, Iran, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and Turkey.

Since 2007, Human Rights First has worked to secure an effective  response to address the protection and assistance needs of Iraqi  refugees and displaced persons. It has pointed out that the United  States has a moral obligation – as well as a strategic interest – to  lead the international community in responding to the protection  concerns of Iraq's refugees and displaced persons. In July 2010, Human  Rights First offered testimony on the subject of Iraqi refugees before the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe (the U.S. Helsinki Commission).

Human Rights First's key recommendations for the United States include:

• The United States should continue to support the protection of  Iraqi refugees and displaced people, by leading the international  community in providing assistance for  Iraqis who have been displaced by  the violence in Iraq and by encouraging other states to join more  robustly in this effort.

• The Department of State, with other relevant agencies, should take  additional steps to improve the pace of resettlement for Iraqi refugees –  at present, they can wait a year or more for their applications to be  processed – so that refugees are not left stranded in difficult or  dangerous circumstances for extended periods of time;

• The Department of State, with other relevant agencies, should  enhance capacity to expedite the resettlement of refugees who face  imminent harm by developing a transparent and formal expedited procedure  for refugees who face an imminent risk of harm; and

• The Department of State, working with the Department of Homeland  Security and intelligence agencies, should improve the staffing,  coordination, and timeliness of the security clearance process so that  Iraqi refugees are not left stranded in difficult and dangerous  situations.
