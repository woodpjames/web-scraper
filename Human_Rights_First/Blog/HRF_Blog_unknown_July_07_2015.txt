One Year in Houston: Human Rights First Radio Interview
July 07, 2015
Last week Ashley Kaper, Managing Attorney at Human Rights First’s Houston office, spoke to Edel Howlins of Houston Matters, an area public radio show. During the interview she discussed the amazing growth of our Houston office in the last year, and how that has helped more asylum seekers receive protection.

Take a listen below to learn more about the asylum process, immigration detention, and how we're continuing to address last year’s surge in asylum seekers from Central America.
