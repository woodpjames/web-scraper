U.S. - Canada Agreement Would
Require Asylum-Seekers to Apply Where
They Arrive First - Causing Further Hardship

Canada and the United States have recently circulated                a draft agreement that would force most asylum seekers to make their                claim in the country they reach first, even if they are planning                only to transit through that country on their way to the other.                With a few limited exceptions, under the agreement refugees would                no longer be able to apply for asylum at the border between the                two countries. This would cause great hardship for many refugees                fleeing from persecution, as it would prevent them from joining                family or friends who can house and support them while they try                to put their lives back together again.

Since many applicants must travel to Canada                via the United States, the agreement will shift a large proportion                of the Canadian caseload to the United States. The Canadian Council                for Refugees (CCR) reported that last year, approximately 35 percent                of asylum claims made in Canada (14,807) were made by people who                arrived in Canada from the United States.

Agreement Would Increase Bureaucracy                & Inefficiency
of Asylum System

Not only would the agreement significantly increase                the U.S. asylum adjudication caseload, it would also require the                creation of a special process and procedures to assess applicability                of the agreement and its exceptions in individual cases - increasing                bureaucracy.

U.S. government officials have indicated that                the agreement is also intended to prevent duplicate asylum claims,                but they have failed to present statistics to demonstrate that there                is a significant basis for this concern. In any case, a narrower                agreement could prevent duplicate claims, and U.S. and Canadian                law and regulations already prohibit asylum seekers who receive                a "permanent offer of resettlement" in one country from applying                for asylum in the other one.

U.S. government officials have confirmed, also,                that this kind of a broad "safe third country" agreement is not                needed for security reasons. If the United States signs it, it would                be as a concession to Canada. Since very few people go from Canada                to the United States to seek asylum, the agreement would have minimal                effect on border crossings into the United States.

In fact the agreement is likely to make the                border less, not more, secure. It would undermine orderly and secure                procedures at the border, as refugees rush to get across before                the agreement takes effect. After that, it would likely create new                smuggling problems, as desperate refugees try to get across the                border illegally. The U.S.-Mexico border's problems of exploitation,                deaths from exposure and difficult border patrolling would spread                to the U.S.-Canada border.

Agreement Would Prevent Reunification                of Family and Friends - Exceptions are Unduly Limited

The draft agreement would needlessly prevent                many refugees from joining their families, as in the case of a 29-year                old Rwandan mother who arrived in the United States recently with                her son, aged 8, and her daughter, aged 10, intending merely to                stop in transit on her way to Canada, where her brother-in-law and                sister-in-law await her. Under the agreement, she would be forbidden                to join them. She would be forced to seek asylum with her two children                in the United States, where she knows no one. And since the United                States does not permit asylum-seekers to work legally, unlike Canada,                a person like this refugee would have no means of support.

This Rwandan refugees and others like her would                not fit into the draft agreement's exceptions, since they are so                limited. For example, although the agreement makes exceptions for                asylum-seekers to join certain family members, the exceptions are                limited to close family members, and to those with certain types                of immigration status.

Asylum-seekers who have a close family member                in one of the countries would be allowed to cross the border to                seek asylum in that country, but only if the relative has refugee                status or legal permanent residence, or has a valid asylum claim                pending. Under another exception, unaccompanied minors would be                permitted to cross the border to pursue an asylum claim.

Refugees have often lost their nuclear families,                so that their closest ties who live in safety are other family members                or friends. They also prefer to go to a place where they can speak                a local language, like Quebec, in the case of the Rwandan refugee.

Refugees could be bounced from one country                to another, causing hardship and increasing bureaucracy

This type of accord is called a "safe third                country" agreement because it signals that the United States and                Canada recognize each other as countries in which it is safe for                persecuted nationals of other countries to seek refuge. But "safe                third country" arrangements between European countries have become                notorious for bouncing would-be refugees from country to country                so commonly that the process has gained                a wry nickname: "refugee soccer." A refugee becomes a soccer ball                when he or she gets rejected by one state on "safe third country"                grounds, only to be rejected again by the state in which he or she                first arrived. It would be simpler and less expensive for would-be                refugees to be allowed to make their claims where they choose.

Consultation process; accord will likely                come into effect
in the late fall

The U.S. State Department and Immigration and                Naturalization Service held a meeting on the draft agreement on                Thursday August 1. At that meeting refugee advocates including Human Rights First                urged that the United States abandon efforts to enter into this                agreement, pointing out that the agreement was inefficient, overly                broad, and unfair to refugees and their families. While U.S. officials                listened to NGO concerns, they said that this "train" was moving                "quite quickly." Indeed the Canadian government wants this agreement                to be signed as soon as possible. It is critical, therefore, to                express opposition to the draft agreement immediately.
