Human Rights First Urges DHS and Congress to Help Haitians Stranded by Quake
April 20, 2010
Human  Rights First joined with dozens of other NGOs to urge DHS Secretary  Janet Napolitano to take crucial steps including rescinding the  so-called "shout test"â€“a discriminatory non-process by which Haitians  picked up at sea will be returned to Haiti unless they express fear  through physical resistance or shouting.

Human Rights First also joined dozens of other NGOs to urge Congress  to support the Haitian Emergency Protection Act of 2010 (S. 2998 and H.  4616), which would allow 55,000 Haitians with approved family visa  applications to enter the United States to join their families while  waiting for their green cards.
