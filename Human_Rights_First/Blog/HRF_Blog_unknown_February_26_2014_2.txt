TODAY: Tune In at 10 a.m. as Human Rights First’s Elisa Massimino talks Syria on The Diane Rehm Show
February 26, 2014
Please tune in today as Human Rights First President and CEO Elisa Massimino joins The Diane Rehm Show to discuss the humanitarian situation in Syria, which continues to deteriorate. As the show’s website notes: Airstrikes against civilians are occurring with more frequency. Refugees are fleeing to border countries straining already tapped resources. And within the country, an estimated nine million people are in need of life saving assistance. As peace talks have stalled, the Obama administration acknowledged a need to reassess policy towards Syria. The president is faced with the same challenging questions from the last three years of the civil war over how to respond. But many observers say while the options are difficult, they do exist. Diane and her guests discuss the crisis in Syria and the world’s failed response. Other guests will include syndicated columnist Michael Gerson, David Schenker of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, and Lehigh University professor Henri Barkey.
