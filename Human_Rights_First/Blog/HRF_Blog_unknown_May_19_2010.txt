Senate Judiciary Committee Hearing on Refugee Protection Act
May 19, 2010
Human Rights First commends the Senate Judiciary Committee for  holding a hearing on May 19 to shine a light on the need to improve the  U.S. asylum and refugee resettlement systems.  Human Rights First is  joined by 88 faith-based, human rights and other groups, as well as 99  experts and others, in supporting the Refugee Protection Act of 2010 (S.  3113). The bill would repair many of the most severe problems in the  U.S. asylum and refugee systems and strengthen the U.S. commitment to  providing refuge to victims of religious, political, ethnic and other  forms of persecution.
