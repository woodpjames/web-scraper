Senator McCain Says He Differs from President Bush on Prisoner Treatment
September 22, 2008
Last night on 60 Minutes Senator McCain listed the treatment of prisoners as one of several policy areas where he differs from President Bush.  Friday's debate on foreign policy issues will offer him a good opportunity to expound upon what he means by this point and what he would do to make changes from the current Administration's policies if he is elected in November. We'll also be listening for what Senator Obama has to say on this crucially important issue.
