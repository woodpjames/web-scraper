Human Rights First Urges Microsoft to Engage Civil Society, End its Role in Abusive Russian Enforcement Practices
September 13, 2010
Washington, DC â€“ Human Rights First President and CEO Elisa  Massimino is urging Microsoft CEO Steven Ballmer to implement a series  of changes to strengthen company efforts to protect fundamental rights.  In a letter sent to Ballmer after a New York Times article exposed Russia's attempts to crack down on civil society groups  with the help of Microsoft, Massimino urged the company to abandon such  efforts and to develop relationships with Russian civil society  activities who could identify and ensure a rapid response to future  incidents.

"Our human rights partners in Russia have long been concerned about  official obstruction of the legitimate activities of independent civil  society organizations and denial of basic rights to non-violent  activists, including selective anti piracy enforcement. These activists  are well-positioned to help Microsoft identify and respond appropriately  to potential abuse. They can also help inform your efforts to expand  Microsoft's programs among civil society in Russia, as well as promote  awareness to ensure wider participation by groups vulnerable to  selective enforcement," Massimino noted.

Microsoft and Human Rights First are both participants in the Global Network Initiative (GNI), a multi-stakeholder group of companies, civil society  organizations (including human rights and press freedom groups),  investors and academics who take a collaborative approach to protect and  advance freedom of expression and privacy in the ICT sector. In her  letter, Massimino noted that the recommendations outlined by Human  Rights First are consistent with Microsoft's obligations under the GNI  to work with other stakeholders to confront government policies and  practices that limit freedom of expression.
