Web Chat TODAY with Egyptian Activist Nora Younis on the Khaled Saeed Murder
June 21, 2010
Khaled Saeed, a 28-year old man, refused to show Egyptian police his ID in a random raid on an Internet cafe in Alexandria. In response, the police dragged him out into the street and beat him to death, in plain view of witnesses.It turns out that Saeed had posted a video exposing police officers doling out the spoils of a drug bust. The Egyptian Ministry has claimed that Saeed is a drug addict, and his cause of death was choking on a joint--this despite numerous eye-witness accounts and videos of the incident.Nora Younis, former HRF awardwinning activist, was at protests following the murder and watched as police came down on protesters with further violence. She'll be with Human Rights First today at 12:30 to talk about the case and answer your questions.
