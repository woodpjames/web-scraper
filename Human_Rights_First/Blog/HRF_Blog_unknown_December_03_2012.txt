Bringing the Human Rights Summit to You
December 03, 2012
We’re excited! Tomorrow is our inaugural Human Rights Summit, a packed two-day event that will gather policymakers, international civil society activists, and military and business leaders to discuss pressing issues that need U.S. global leadership on human rights. For those who may not be at the Summit in Washington, D.C., we want to bring the Summit to you. Here’s how: Sessions during the two-day Summit will cover human rights issues including the Arab Spring, emerging technologies, immigration reform, and more. Senator Richard Durbin (D – IL) and John McCain (R-AZ), Chairman of the United Civil Front Garry Kasparov, President of the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission Dr. Richard Land, and Vice President of Communications and Public Policy at Facebook Elliot Schrage, and many others will join us as guest speakers. See the full agenda. We hope to see your comments online!
