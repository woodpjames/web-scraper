George Bush's 9/11 Statement Falls Short of Addressing Bigotry
September 13, 2010
Over the week-end, George Bush released a concise statement to mark the anniversary of September 11th:

"On September 11, 2001, Americans awoke to evil on our shores. On this  solemn day of remembrance, Laura and I hold the victims and their  families in our thoughts and prayers. We recall the many acts of heroism  on that day, and we honor those who work tirelessly to prevent another  attack. May God bless our great country and those who defend her."

While offering comfort and sympathy to the people that no doubt deserve a  mention in any Sept. 11th commemorating statement, President Bush has  regrettably avoided addressing the recent wave of anti-Muslim  intolerance and bigotry that spread across the United States following  the controversies over the 'Ground Zero mosque' and  'Burn-a-Koran day'.

It would have been appropriate for George Bush to speak out for  tolerance and freedom of religion, the way he and members of his  administration did while in office.  We still need our leaders, past and present, to speak out against ALL  of the anti-Muslim rhetoric that is pervading our political discourse.  Beyond the negative rhetoric, there are cases of actual violence targeting Muslims across the U.S., incidents that leave entire communities extremely vulnerable.

George Bush can still lend his voice to those who feel threatened and  stand up for American values. The American Muslims are waiting for him  to do so, as are the nine thousand of Human Rights First's supporters  who signed our open letter to Mr. Bush.
