President Sets                  Refugee Resettlement
Ceiling at 70,000 for FY2002

State Department                  Issues New Security Procedures

No Word on When                  Refugees Will Begin to Arrive Again

   Refugee resettlement in the United States is still stalled, butÂ some obstacles have been removed.   
 
President Signs Document Allowing Refugee                Resettlement

Last Wednesday President Bush signed the Presidential                Determination (PD), a document that sets the maximum number of refugees                to be admitted in a given fiscal year. Bush fixed the ceiling for                FY2002 at 70,000. That is the lowest number in more than a decade,                and a 50 percent drop since 1992. And because of the long delay                this fall, far fewer than 70,000 refugees will likely be resettled                this year.

The low number is disappointing but it is good                news that the PD was finally signed since no refugees could be resettled                without it. Virtually none were resettled, in fact, during the two                months in which the PD went unsigned. More than 22,000 who had already                been approved to come to the United States found themselves stuck                overseas in limbo instead. Warm thanks to all of you who wrote,                faxed, or called the President, urging him to sign the PD.

New Security Procedures Issued

Another obstacle to resettling new refugees                was an interagency security review of the resettlement program,                ordered in the wake of the September 11 attacks. That review was                completed as of last week, according to State Department officials.                Government officials have not released any information on the security                review's conclusions, except a cable that the State Department sent                to U.S. embassies last Friday Nov. 23, informing them of new security                procedures to be applied to refugees travelling to the United States.                Some of the 'new' procedures were already in effect in certain areas.

Security procedures listed in the cable include                the following:

All cases of refugees who had already been accepted, and who                  are relatives of people already in the United States, are to be                  returned to the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) for                  an "anti-fraud and security review." The great majority of the                  refugees who fall into the affected categories are Angolans, Burundians,                  Congolese, Sudanese and Sierra Leonians, according to the INS.                  It is unknown how long that review will take.
 Each refugee must be photographed, facing the camera and in                  profile, when he or she arrives for the interview that is part                  of a refugee application. This does not apply to those already                  accepted to come to the United States.
Refugees must be compared with their photographs when they board                  flights on their way to the United States.
Security checks already done for refugees accepted to come to                  the United States before September 11 must be repeated, if the                  checks were completed before November 1. According to an official                  at the State Department's Bureau of Population, Refugees, and                  Migration (PRM), the databases used for checking have been improved.

State Department: Resettlement                Might Resume Quickly, But No Guarantees 

For several weeks, the State Department has                already been asking embassies to begin repeating security checks                that were done before November 1, so PRM officials are hoping that                refugees may begin arriving in the United States within as little                as two weeks. They have been careful to point out, however, that                they do not know for sure.

In recent years refugee resettlement has been                suspended between mid-December and the first week of January, to                allow a holiday break. This year, resettlement agencies in the United                States have asked the State Department not to follow this custom,                to prevent further delay. It is not yet clear whether it will be                observed.

When Will New Refugees Be Interviewed,                Beyond Those Already Accepted?

About 22,000 refugees had already been approved                to enter the United States, before the September 11 attacks. Since                the attacks INS officers have stopped making "circuit rides," overseas                trips to interview refugee applicants, and no longer conduct refugee                interviews outside U.S. embassies or their equivalent. As a result,                out of 16 worldwide cities where the INS was interviewing refugees                before September 11, now there are only two: Vienna and Havana.                As a result, no interviews are being conducted in countries or regions                with some of the largest and most vulnerable refugee populations,                such as Pakistan and Africa.

It is not known when the circuit rides will                be resumed. Before that can happen, the INS leadership must decide                to resume the trips, and, in addition, a sufficient number of INS                officers must volunteer to travel.

Given the remaining obstacles, in other words,                we are still far from bringing U.S. refugee resettlement back to                what it has been in recent years. One resettlement expert said Tuesday                that she would be surprised if more than 35,000 refugees make it                to the United States during all of FY 2002.
