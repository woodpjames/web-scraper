Pressure is on to Establish Accountability for Torture
July 08, 2010
Pressure is mounting on the U.S. government to start taking seriously its obligation to hold U.S. government officials accountable for torture and detainee abuse.The Center for Justice and Accountability recently filed a complaint with the New York State Office of Professions calling for an investigation into Major John Francis Leso, the psychologist who allegedly led the development of abusive interrogation techniques at Guantanamo Bay. The complaint claims Dr. Leso violated professional standards by recommending that escalating physically and psychologically abusive interrogation tactics be used on detainees, and personally supervised and participated in their use. If the claims are substantiated, Major Leso could lose his license to practice psychology. In another major development, David Cameron, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, announced this week there would be an inquiry into British officials' involvement in torture and abuses--notably prisoners rendered to Guantanamo or foreign countries where they were subsequently tortured.President Obama has stated that he would like to look forward, not backward. But does that mean we turn a blind eye to crimes? The United States should establish its own inquiry. Sign our petition.
