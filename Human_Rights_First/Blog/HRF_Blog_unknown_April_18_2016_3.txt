April 18, 2016
By Gregory Felder  Those who fear that accepting Syrian refugees will make America less safe don't have the full picture on the refugee resettlement process. In this video, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson explains the rigorous security screening refugees must go through before being admitted into the United States. The National Counterterrorism Center, FBI, Department of Homeland Security, Department of State, and Department of Defense are all involved in the screening process, which includes in-depth interviews, medical examinations, and biometric security checks. In addition to the intensive screening applied to all refugees, Syrians receive an enhanced review. As Secretary Johnson explains, the process is very thorough and keeps America as safe as possible while assisting refugees who are fleeing persecution.
