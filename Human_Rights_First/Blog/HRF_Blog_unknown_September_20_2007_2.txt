No Laughing Matter
September 20, 2007
Proving once again that Comedy Central outdoes the "real" news with its coverage of today's issues, last night's line-up featured a Stephen Colbert interview with Naomi Wolf. At 3:14 ,Wolf and Colbert discuss the Bush Administration's use of secret prisons and torture. In her new book, Wolf argues that the establishment of secret prisons where torture occurs is a step toward despotism. And, earlier in the evening, Jon Stewart sat down with Gen. Wesley Clark for an interview where Clark defends America's commitment of the highest standards of conduct and engagement. (This can be found at approx 1:06, after the conversation on the Iraq surge.)
