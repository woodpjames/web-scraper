Yesterday, Sens. Dick Durbin (D -Ill.), Russ Feingold (D -Wis.) and Edward Kennedy (D - Mass.) requested that President Bush withdraw the nomination of Steven Bradbury to the Office of Legal Counsel at the Department of Justice  over concerns of his role in secret DoJ memos authorizing torture.  Meanwhile, the confirmation hearing for President Bush's Attorney General nominee, Judge Michael Mukasey, begins at 10:00 today.  We'll be providing updates from the hearing throughout the day.
