U.S. Reopens Torture Case
June 05, 2008
From the AP:A leading Homeland Security Department investigator said Thursday his office is re-examining the conclusions of a probe that exonerated the government in the case of a Canadian engineer who was seized by U.S. officials, sent to Syria and allegedly tortured.The chief of internal investigations at the Homeland Security, Richard Skinner, said at a congressional hearing that his office could not rule out that the United States wanted to send Maher Arar to Syria because it believed he would be tortured. He said that the U.S. Justice Department had been informed of that possibility and is currently investigating.Skinner said that his office has new information that contradicts an earlier conclusion of its own investigation on the Arar case.
