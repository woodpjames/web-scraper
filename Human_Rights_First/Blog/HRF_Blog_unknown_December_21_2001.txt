Refugee Resettlement Slowly Resumes
At House Hearings, Professor Argues                Asylum-Seekers Need Not be Detained

After a hiatus of nearly three months, the                U.S. refugee resettlement program resumed on December 11, with a                flight from Zagreb to Los Angeles. According to the International                Organization for Migration (IOM), which has been coordinating the                flights, more than 500 refugees were scheduled to travel to the                United States in December. Some of those refugees' travel plans                were cancelled, however, because security checks had not been completed                in time.

The refugee resettlement program has been frozen                since the end of September, for two reasons. First, the Bush Administration                delayed until November 21 before setting the maximum number of refugees                to be admitted in fiscal year 2002 at 70,000 - a decision usually                made at the end of September. Second, the Administration conducted                a security review of the program. Since that review, more extensive                security checks are being carried out on refugees. Special Advisory                Opinions or SAOs are to be carried out on all men aged 16 to 55,                from a classified list of countries. (An INS official said the list                is simply "all countries" and the State Department refused to comment.)

Also in the wake of the security review, all                refugees over age 14 are being fingerprinted at the airports (ports                of entry) where they arrive in the United States, and refugees may                arrive only at four airports: JFK in New York, LAX in Los Angeles,                O'Hare in Chicago, and MIA in Miami. This has caused delays of two                to five hours at the airports, during the first week of renewed                travel.

To reduce the delays, which have caused refugees                to miss connecting flights, and to avoid overwhelming INS personnel                at the airports, IOM has set a limit of no more than 30 refugees                per flight. That has, in turn, limited the number of refugees who                can arrive per day. The State Department's bureau of Population,                Refugees and Migration reported that 223 refugees arrived during                the week of December 11. In the following week, 360 were scheduled                to travel, and 89 were scheduled for the last week of December.                This is a much lower rate than usual, although the traditional holiday                moratorium on refugee resettlement has been dropped this year. Only                Dec. 22-25th and 31st and Jan.1 will be considered program holidays.

IOM officials said they hope to increase the                rate of resettlement in January, and again in the following months.                To meet the ceiling of 70,000 for the fiscal year, the rate of refugee                processing and resettlement would have to increase very dramatically                during the rest of the year.

About 23,000 refugees had been approved for                entry into the United States, and were stuck abroad when the program                was stopped after September 11. Tens of thousands of others would                like to be resettled in the United States, but for the moment they                cannot, since the INS has suspended sending officers abroad to conduct                refugee screening interviews. In many countries, the obstacle is                to find a building that is considered sufficiently secure, in which                to conduct interviews. In Moscow, for example, the INS was evacuated                from its old building and has been temporarily relocated, but is                now processing only non-refugee applications and petitions. The                INS plans to return to work on refugee applications in February.                In the meantime, thousands of refugees must simply wait.

The long moratorium in refugee resettlement                has also had serious consequences for the Americans whose work is                to help refugees. Since resettlement agencies receive government                funding according to the number of refugees they actually resettle,                many have watched their budgets dry up, and have been forced to                fire many staff members.

At House Hearings on INS Detention,                Professor Argues for Alternatives to Detention of Asylum-Seekers

At the U.S. House of Representatives' Dec. 19                hearings on the "release policies" of the INS with respect to a                wide range of immigration detainees (not just asylum-seekers) Professor                Margaret Taylor of the Wake Forest University School of Law argued                against mandatory detention. She urged the members of the House's                Subcommittee on Immigration to consider supervised release as an                alternative to detention, citing a Vera Institute for Justice study                in which 91 percent of supervised people in immigration proceedings                appeared for all of their hearings. Edward McElroy, INS district                director for New York, attacked the study, saying it was statistically                unreliable.

Much of the hearing focused on the cases of                individual detainees. One of the witnesses, Paul H. Thomson, Commonwealth                Attorney for the city of Winchester, Virginia, recounted the case                of Edward Nathaniel Bell, a Jamaican man who was convicted on a                weapons charge, arrested by the INS and released on bond by an immigration                judge. After his release, Bell killed a Virginia police officer.

Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren (D-CA) raised quite                a different case. Rep. Lofgren asked about four Boy Scouts from                Tanzania who attended the National Scout Jamboree in Virginia in                July, hitchhiked to Washington D.C. and asked for asylum there.                The four are now in detention, although, Lofgren said, their visas                are valid until January. Joseph Greene, INS Acting Deputy Executive                Associate Commissioner for Field Operations, answered that the boys                are in a "sheltered care facility" not a prison. Lofgren retorted                that she had experience with juvenile detention facilities and demanded                to know why the four boys are still detained. Did the INS really                think they were dangerous? Hesitating, Greene finally answered that                the decision to detain the four Tanzanian boys, aged 14 to 17, was                "driven as much by concern for the security of juveniles as for                society at large." Some members of the audience looked incredulous.

Twelve immigration and/or refugee advocacy organizations,                including Human Rights First, signed onto a                Detention Watch Network document entitled "A Review of the Department                of Justice Immigration Detention Policies." It was circulated to                the members of the House Immigration subcommittee before the hearings,                and entered as part of the hearing testimony.
