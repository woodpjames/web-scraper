As Confirmation Progresses, Hagel Must Stay True to Reaching Beyond the Norm, Towards Something Better
January 09, 2013
 In 2009 Human Rights First brought together a group of distinguished guests and experts as part of a discussion onthe human rights and national security challenges faced during the Obama Administration’s first 100 days in office. Then-Senator Chuck Hagel (R-NE) spoke at the event, arguing that U.S. policy should aim for a higher standard, not merely maintain status quo. Now that Sen. Hagel has been nominated Secretary of Defense he will have the chance to be a key player in creating and projecting that standard. As Hagel’s confirmation moves forward, Human Rights First urges the Senate to use the process as a robust examination of U.S. human rights policies. When addressing counter-terrorism, challenges in the Middle East, andthe prevention of mass atrocities, the United States must be faithful to human rights standards. For more information, see what issues Human Rights First will be following as the hearings progress.
