The jury continues to deliberate; Capt. Wood testifies in another abuse court martial
June 01, 2006
Jury deliberations are still going on at the Cardona court martial.  Meanwhile,   AP reports that,  yesterday, Capt. Carolyn Wood was called as a witness in another abuse  court martial, this time of a military interrogator under her command in  Afghanistan. The interrogator, Private First Class Damien Corsetti, "is  accused of hitting, kicking and threatening to sexually assault  detainees" in late 2002 at the U.S detention facility in Bagram,  Afghanistan.

Tim Golden of the New York Times wrote a series  of excellent articles (subscription required for all) about detainee  abuse at Bagram, including, specifically, horrific beatings that lead to  the deaths of two detainees.  In one, a May 20, 2005 story, Corsetti is  described "lightheartedly" by one of his fellow soldiers as "the King  of Torture."   But Capt. Wood disclaims any knowledge of alleged  wrongdoing by her subordinate:  according to yesterday's AP report,  Capt. Wood testified that she never saw Corsetti "do anything wrong."

Last  week, I'd referred to Capt. Wood as one of the "Where's Waldos" of the  torture and abuse scandal -- abuses took place under her watch in both  Afghanistan and Iraq.  It now turns out that the defense in the Corsetti  case is raising issues similar to those the defense argued in the  Cardona court-martial:  the rules on interrogation of detainees were  unclear.  Of course, Capt. Wood bears part of the responsibility for  setting clear rules and making sure those under her command were  properly trained.  She has not, however, been held accountable for her  role in policies and practices (including any failure to issue clear and  lawful guidance) that contributed to detainee abuse.  Yesterday, AP  reports, Capt. Wood testified at her subordinate's court martial under a  grant of immunity from prosecution.
