The CNN Freedom Project Highlights Plight of Yazidi Slaves
October 14, 2015
In a new animated short presented by The CNN Freedom Project, heart-wrenching images of the plight of the Yazidis of Mount Sinjar shine a light on the intersection between ISIS, human trafficking, and a vulnerable minority group subjected to violence and cruelty. After ISIS captured Mosul on June 10th, 2014, militants traveled west and captured thousands of Yazidi women and children, selling them in slave markets. Now, groups on the ground are trying to rescue them. The video is accompanied by resources highlighting those who are spearheading the efforts. To watch the full video, click here.
