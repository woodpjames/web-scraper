Harassmap Founder Addresses Sexual Violence In Egypt
November 09, 2012
Human Rights First is running a series of profiles on human rights defenders we work with in various countries. These profiles help to explain their work, motivations, and challenges. Rebecca T. Chiao is one of the co-founders of HarassMap, an initiative that uses social media to draw attention to street harassment in Cairo, Egypt and coordinate outreach activities in the streets to encourage bystanders to protect victims. This innovative online tool geolocates sites of harassment anonymously reported via text messages, allowing communities to identify high risk zones ripe for preventative action. We featured Rebecca during Women’s Month this year, and recently, she appeared on TEDXAlmedalen to discuss her work.
