Then and Now: Will Life Sentence for Times Square Bomber Silence Fearmonger Chorus?
October 05, 2010
When  Faizal Shahzad  was arrested in connection to the attempted Times  Square bombing 53 hours after the  undetonated device was discovered,  the usual crew of fearmongers wanted us to be  scared.  Rudy Giuiliani said that  we should never have read him a Miranda warning. Rep. Peter King said he  should be tried in a military commission.  Liz  Cheney said that reading Shahzad his Miranda rights was the “wrong way to  win this war.”
Maybe they should  rethink those positions.
Faizal  Shahzad was  sentenced to life in prison this morning.  More than 400  other terrorists have  also been convicted in our federal court system.  Shahzad’s stiff penalty and the  successful handling of these federal  terrorism cases stand in stark contrast to  military commission  proceedings, which have only secured four convictions since  9/11,  including of two individuals who are already free. Our courts can handle   terrorism cases now just as they have for decades. Learn more about their track record.
