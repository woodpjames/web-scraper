Update on Reporters Banned from Guantanamo
June 15, 2010
The Defense Department stood behind its decision to ban key reporters from future hearings at Guantanamo, reports the Miami Herald today. But it will "consider lifting the coverage ban on these reporters if they individually request reinstatement."Human Rights First has a petition running urging the department to reconsider--in the name of transparency. Help put on the pressure! Sign it today.Human Rights First previously covered this story on the blog and called out the decision as counter to the administration's commitment to transparency. We organized a letter to the Defense Department, signed by other prominent rights groups, calling for it to reconsider. Let's hope it happens before the hearings begin again later this month.
