Egypt Protests Demand End to Repressive Regime
February 05, 2011
Human Rights First has been working with frontline activists in Egypt for decades, including some who spent years in jail for the cause of democracy and human rights. In this week's podcast, Human Rights First comments on Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's thirty-year regime and the change in Egypt's political climate that made way to recent uprisings and call for democracy.

Podcast produced by Stephen Brownell.
