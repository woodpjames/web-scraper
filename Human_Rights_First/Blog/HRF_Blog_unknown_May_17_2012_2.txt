WATCH LIVE: Equality Talk on LGBTI Refugees
May 17, 2012
To commemorate International Day Against Homobophia and Transphobia, Human Rights First partners with Human Rights Council and Council for Global Equality in today’s Equality Talk to release our new report, The Road to Safety: Strengthening Protection of LGBTI Refugees in Uganda and Kenya, and raise issues facing LGBTI refugees. In December 2011, the Obama Administration issued a Presidential directive to protect LGBT rights at home and abroad across U.S. government agencies. A six month progress review is expected to take place this summer. Today’s Equality Talk will highlight recommendations highlighted in the report and steps that the United States can take in making sure that LGBTI refugees have access to safe housing and protection from violence. Watch Equality Talk starting at 3:30pm EST:  Live streaming by Ustream
