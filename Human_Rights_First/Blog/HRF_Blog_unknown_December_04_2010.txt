As Wikileaks Unloads, Questions about Safety, Torture and Censorship Raised
December 04, 2010
In this week's podcast:

Wikileaks started releasing over 250,000 U.S. State Department documents from American embassies around the world, revealing sensitive US diplomatic relations with other countries.

Whether WikiLeaks has violated the law by publishing classified information or not, the disclosure of these documents has raised a number of human rights issues, ranging from concerns about the safety of U.S.-supported human rights advocates operating in repressive societies, disclosures about interference efforts on the part of the both the Bush and Obama Administrations with regards to torture cases, and free speech questions about how companies respond to government pressure to censor.
