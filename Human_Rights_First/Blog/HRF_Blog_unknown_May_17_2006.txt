President's Border Control Plan Ignores Impact on Refugees
May 17, 2006
Earlier this week President Bush 
outlined his plan for enhanced border control and immigration reform. Missing 
from the President’s speech – and from much of the congressional debate on 
immigration reform – was any concern over proposed enforcement provisions that 
will put at risk those who flee persecution and seek refuge in the U.S.

 
“Both the President’s plan and the 
congressional immigration bills contain sweeping enforcement provisions that 
will endanger those who have fled political and religious persecution and sought 
safe haven in this country,” said Eleanor 
Acer, director of Human Rights First’s refugee protection 
program.  “These proposals could 
lead to the mistaken deportation of a victim of religious persecution from 
China, the jailing of a rape 
survivor from Darfur, or the criminal prosecution of a pro-democracy activist 
from Burma.”   
 
In his speech, President Bush 
reiterated his commitment to increasing immigration detention and expanding the 
use of a summary deportation process. This approach and the various 
congressional proposals ignore the findings of the bi-partisan U.S. Commission 
on International Religious Freedom, which found significant failings in the 
government’s implementation of the summary process and concluded that asylum 
seekers were inappropriately jailed in the U.S. in 
prison-like facilities. 
 
Human Rights First urges the White 
House and the U.S. Senate to oppose provisions that undermine this country’s 
commitment to refugees and put those who have fled from political and religious 
persecution at risk of being deported back to danger.  To learn more about the particular
