Shehrbano Taseer: Promoting Tolerance in Pakistan
March 01, 2012
Honoring Inspiring Women for Women's Month and International Women's Day Shehrbano Taseer is the daughter of late Pakistani Governor Salmaan Taseer, who was murdered by a member of his own bodyguard for speaking out against religious blasphemy laws. Shehrbano’s activism inspired her father’s fight against the misuse of Pakistani anti-blasphemy laws, which punish those convicted of speaking against Islam with death. She partnered with Human Rights First to combat religious intolerance and violence without restricting speech. In March 2011, the U.N. Human Rights Council adopted a groundbreaking resolution, seeking to address violence, discrimination and incitement to religious hatred without reference to the controversial notion of “defamation of religions”. Days before the deal was brokered, Human Rights First invited Shehrbano to be a part of the effort in Geneva to create a new consensual momentum. Shehrbano continues to partner with Human Rights First and has become a voice for a tolerant and progressive Pakistan.
