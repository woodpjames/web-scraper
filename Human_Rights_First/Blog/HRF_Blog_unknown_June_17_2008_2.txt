Congress Gets to Work
June 17, 2008
Today, the Senate Armed Services Committee will be holding a hearing on the Bush Administration's torture policies.  While most people would say that Congressional oversight is a good thing, the editors at the Wall Street Journal today take issue with the whole idea of checks and balances and blast the very idea of Congress doing its job.    Here's the opening:Nearly seven years after 9/11, the U.S. homeland hasn't been struck again andAmerican civil liberties remain intact. So how does Congress say "thank you"? Bytrying to ruin the men who in good faith set the legal rules that have kept ussafe.Who knew that Congress's job was to say "thank you" to the executive branch!?  I must have missed that line in the Constitution.Despite the rantings of the Journal, today's hearing promises to be informative.  Here's the AP:Military psychologists were enlisted to help develop more aggressiveinterrogation methods, including snarling dogs, forced nudity and long periodsof standing, against terrorism suspects, according to a Senateinvestigation.Before they were approved by then-Defense Secretary Donald H.Rumsfeld, such harsh. techniques had drawn warnings from military lawyers thatthey could be illegal, an investigation by the Senate Armed Services Committeehas found.We'll be providing updates from the hearing throughout the day.
