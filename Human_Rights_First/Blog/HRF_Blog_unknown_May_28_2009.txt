Former Vice President Cheney â€” Wrong Again
May 28, 2009
Check out the Director of the Bellevue/NYU Program for Survivors of Torture, Allen Keller, writing at Huffington Post about just how wrong the former Vice President's facts were in his torture-defending speech last Thursday. Key point:Torture is neither reliable in eliciting accurate information nor in promoting national security. It is a violation of domestic and international law. Our use of torture has undermined our security and credibility including our capacity to speak out against despot regimes who routinely torture innocent civilians. An honest and full accounting of what happened is a crucial step in making this world a safer place.
