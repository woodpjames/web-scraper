One year after Trump's election: Winning fights for human rights
November 08, 2017
One year ago today, Donald Trump was elected president. For those who believe that American leadership is essential in the global struggle for human rights, these are challenging times. But American leadership isn't only the responsibility of our government. American leadership is shared by all of us. By you and me. That's why for the past year we've been on the frontlines together, defending American ideals. And this is only the beginning of what we can accomplish if we continue to stand together.Â Give today and help us keep fighting.
