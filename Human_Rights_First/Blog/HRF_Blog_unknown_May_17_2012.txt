Secretary Clinton: Help Protect LGBTI Refugees from Violence
May 17, 2012
By Duncan Breen Today is International Day against Homophobia and Transphobia, and we need your voice on these issues more than ever. Six months ago, President Obama committed to make the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people a priority in U.S. foreign policy. Since then, the U.S. State Department has made great strides in that direction, but there is still much more to be done—including for LGBTI refugees. Help us make a difference. Tell Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to help make sure that LGBTI refugees gain access to safety and protection from violence in their countries of asylum. LGBTI  refugees are the most vulnerable and isolated among refugees. They seek protection from violence and discrimination in a new country only to face the same persecution from which they fled. In our recently published report, The Road to Safety, we found that LGBTI refugees in Uganda and Kenya have been abducted, beaten, and raped. Others have been forced to relocate their homes because their landlords, neighbors, or other refugees harass or evict them. Stand with us on International Day against Homophobia and Transphobia.  Tell Secretary Clinton to protect LGBTI refugees.
