Refugees Renew America: Events in Honor of World Refugee Day
June 16, 2016
This coming week, in honor of World Refugee Day, Human Rights First will hold a series of events to celebrate the lives of refugees and the inspiring dedication of those that are committed to helping them. In New York City, Washington, D.C., Houston, and Los Angeles we will host receptions honoring refugees and the efforts of the volunteer lawyers, paralegals, and interpreters that work alongside them. And in New York City, Washington, D.C., Boston, and San Francisco, Veterans for American Ideals—a project of Human Rights First—will host interactive discussions about refugees who served alongside the U.S. Armed Forces in Iraq and Afghanistan as translators and interpreters.
