Top Ten Signs We Finally Have an Anti-Torture President
April 18, 2008
It’s bad enough to see torture glamorized on TV. What's worse is that we now know that torture was choreographed from inside the White House. Fortunately, the remaining presidential candidates are on record opposing torture. For April Fools' Day -- and in honor of seeing one of the anti-torture candidates appear on The Late Show with David Letterman – we asked our activists to come up with the top 10 signs we’ll know next January that we in fact have a President who opposes torture. Here’s the top ten list they came up with, presented by none other than Jack Bauer:This top ten list is funny, but torture is no laughing matter. It not only harms its victims, it undermines our national security and our country’s values. Join us in putting an end to torture and official cruelty.
