The Truth on Torture
March 05, 2014
Five years ago today, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) launched an inquiry into the CIA's post-9/11 torture program. SSCI chair Senator Dianne Feinstein has called this “one of the most significant oversight efforts in the history of the United States Senate.” Five years later, the committee has produced and approved a 6,000-plus-page report based on a review of over 6 million pages of official records. But here's the problem: the report remains secret, hidden from the American people. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence will soon vote on whether to seek declassification and release of key portions of the report. Join me in urging the committee to vote in favor of releasing the report. Senators familiar with the report say it will show that torture in the CIA program was more widespread than we thought, and ineffective at securing the information needed to stop terrorist attacks. But until these findings are made public, proponents of so-called "enhanced interrogation techniques"—a euphemism for torture—will continue to advocate for a return to these techniques, arguing that they are lawful and effective. The American people deserve to know the truth about torture. So let's send that message loud and clear. Help us press the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence to vote to make public its report on the post-9/11 torture program.
