Waterboardin', USA
November 08, 2007
Harry Shearer has released "Waterboardin', USA", a song featuring such lines as, "Well, it's nothing like surfin, cause you can't get off if you want to," and,  "If the tables were turned, we'd feel really burned, But let's go waterboarding USA." It's like the Beach Boys.  Only different. The video and a MP3 download are available here.
