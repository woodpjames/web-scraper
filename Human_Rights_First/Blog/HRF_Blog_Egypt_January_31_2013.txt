What: Human Rights Challenges as Egypt Prepares for Parliamentary Elections Amid escalating protests and violence in Egypt, the United States is watching anxiously for signs that Egypt’s transition from authoritarianism can move forward.  Parliamentary elections are expected to take place in the next few months.    These are critical times for Egyptian democracy activists who have not been able to channel the energy of the 2011 protests into victory at the polls. What do activists expect from these elections, and what are the obstacles to Egypt achieving progress toward a peaceful democratic transition?  What can the United States do — and what should it not do — to promote human rights and universal values in Egypt in the vital months ahead?
