New York Times Interactive Map Illustrates the Slow Pace of U.S. Resettlement of Syrian Refugees
November 03, 2015
Since 2012 the United States has resettled only 1,854 Syrian refugees—a small fraction of the four million people who have fled horrific violence in search of safety. A new interactive map from The New York Times illustrates the slow trickle of these refugees arriving in 130 American cities. New York Times reporter Haeyoun Park notes that despite the president’s meager commitment to resettle at least 10,000 Syrian refugees in the next year, Syrian refugees still account for only a small share of all refugees who are admitted to the United States. Indeed, the United States has done much more in previous major world conflicts to protect refugees. "The United States has also admitted far larger numbers in the past. In 1979, it provided sanctuary to 111,000 Vietnamese refugees, and in 1980, it added another 207,000. Around the same time, the country took in more than 120,000 Cuban refugees during the Mariel boatlift, including around 80,000 in one month alone.”   Human Rights First continues to press the Obama Administration to demonstrate strong leadership to address the largest refugee crisis since World War II by leading a comprehensive global effort – in partnership with European allies – to advance the protection of Syrian refugees. This must include a major resettlement initiative by the United States, the world leader in refugee resettlement, to the tune of resettling at least 100,000 Syrian refugees next year.
