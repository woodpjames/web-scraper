A Voice for Closing Guantánamo
August 24, 2010
Today on Worldview, Major General William Nash participated in a comprehensive interview discussing why and how Guantánamo should be closed. Gen. Nash was part of a group of retired military leaders who traveled with us last week to Illinois to meet with candidates for the U.S. House and Senate to discuss these issues.  Listen to the interview. The trip to Illinois was one step amidst a broader campaign that Human Rights First is leading to share the facts about military commissions with congressional candidates during this election season. Our time-tested federal courts are a better choice for terrorism trials. You can join us in our effort by signing our petition.
