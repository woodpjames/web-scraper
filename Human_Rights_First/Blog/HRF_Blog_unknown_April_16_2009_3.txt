Human Rights First Reacts to Release of Torture Memos
April 16, 2009
New York  We applaud the Obama Administration's transparency and its decision to release additional documentation about how the Bush Administration officially authorized cruel interrogations. But we urge the Justice Department to investigate all potential criminal conduct related to the authorization or engagement of detainee abuse," said Devon Chaffee, advocacy counsel from Human Rights First.Â  "Releasing this kind of information and holding those who have violated the law to account are essential to restoring the rule of law and strengthening security for the American people. These documents paint a clear picture of the faulty reasoning used to circumvent fundamental humane treatment standards for detainees in U.S. custody. The release of these memos also underscores the importance of fully informing the public about this troubling chapter in our nation's history to ensure that it is never repeated.
