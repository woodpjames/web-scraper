Increased Arrests Reported Around Bahrain Grand Prix Site
April 09, 2013
Less than two weeks before the Bahrain Grand Prix, the Bahrain Center for Human Rights expressed grave concerns about reports of increased house raids by masked men in civilian clothing and arrests in villages near the race site Bahrain International Circuit. The raids and arrests have been reported to have happened last week, the same week when Formula One mogul Bernie Ecclestone announced that he has no concerns about this yearâ€™s race nor has he heard of negative reports coming from the country. Reports indicate that fifteen Bahrainis, mostly youths, have been arrested in two towns near the race site. Bahrain is still in crisis and the government crackdown continues. Human Rights First urges Formula One organizers, participants, and sponsors to speak out against any raids and arrests designed to intimidate Bahrainis from protesting peacefully during or around the Bahrain Grand Prix.
