Tonight at 7pm EST: An Evening with Esperanza Spalding
January 28, 2014
Tonight at 7pm, join us for an evening of performance and a discussion about Guantanamo with Grammy Award-winner Esperanza Spalding. Esperanza has partnered with Human Rights First to raise awareness about how to close Guantanamo responsibly. She took a stand for justice when she launched her new music video titled We Are America in November 2013. The video proceeded the enactment of a new law lifting transfer restrictions that had stalled the administration’s efforts to put Guantanamo on the path to closure. Now it’s time for Congress and the administration to get the job done. Join the thousands calling for the responsible closure of the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay. Here’s how: Looking forward to the conversation.
