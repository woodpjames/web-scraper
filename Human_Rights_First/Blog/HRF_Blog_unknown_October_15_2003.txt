New DHS Initiatives Impact Asylum Seekers and          Detention Human Rights First Releases Report on US Law and Security
Take          Action Now!  

A series of recent Department of Homeland Security initiatives relating          to detention and asylum seekers have sparked questions around the country.          These initiatives include a new “pilot” detention program          in Connecticut, the use of electronic monitoring devises in Florida, and          a DHS request for contractors to conduct intensive supervised release          projects in 8 cities.

In addition, as described below, Human Rights First has recently released          a report on US Law and Security policies. A link to the new report appears          at the end of this newsletter.

Asylum Seekers in Connecticut Detained Under New Pilot Program 

The New York Times and Associated Press reported last month          that the Department of Homeland Security and its interior enforcement          arm, the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (known as “ICE”),          had initiated a pilot program in Connecticut to detain asylum seekers          and other immigrants who were not already detained. The pilot program          began in August with no notification to the public. The program, which          was reported to be underway in Hartford, Connecticut, was scheduled to          terminate on September 30, 2003.

Under the pilot program, non-citizens who were denied asylum or other          relief entitling them to stay in the country by an immigration judge could          be immediately taken into DHS/ICE custody and detained until deported.          If not for this pilot program, asylum seekers and other non-citizens would          remain free while pursuing appeals to the Board of Immigration Appeals          and potentially the Federal Court of Appeals. The decision to detain is          made by an ICE official in Hartford, and though there may be some extreme          circumstances that would weigh against detaining an individual, those          criteria have not been made public. Some of the people who are being detained          may be eligible for release on payment of a bond, although many asylum          seekers and others cannot afford to pay the extraordinarily high bond          amounts that have reportedly been required for release.

Among those detained under this program are asylum seekers who are in          removal proceedings after having voluntarily identified themselves to          U.S. immigration authorities (now DHS’s BCIS) by applying for asylum.          Penalizing this group for detention is counterproductive. Asylum seekers          should not be discouraged from coming forward to seek protection and those          who have voluntarily come forward should not be penalized by being detained.          DHS and ICE have not released public information indicating whether they          plan to expand this “pilot program.”

Ankle Bracelets for Asylum Seekers in Florida –
Alternative to Detention or Alternative to Parole? 

In August, the Department of Homeland Security/ICE initiated a program          in Miami, Florida through which asylum seekers were released from detention          but subject to electronic monitoring devices (EMDs). The Women’s          Commission for Refugee Women and Children, the Florida Immigrant Advocacy          Center and Human Rights First wrote to DHS Secretary          Ridge to express concern about the use of these devices as a substitute          for the parole of asylum seekers without such intrusive monitoring. The          groups noted that the devices could be useful in allowing for the release          of individuals who would otherwise be detained.

Asylum seekers subject to the Miami program are not permitted to leave          their homes for more than five hours, hampering their ability to meet          with lawyers or to attend to medical or family matters. In one case, ICE          authorities believed an asylum seeker had violated the requirements of          the program when he left his home to appear for his immigration court          hearing at the Krome Service Processing Center.

DHS Requests Proposals from Contractors To
Run Intensive Supervised Release Projects in 8 Cities 

Over the past several months the Department of Homeland Security/Bureau          of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), has been soliciting proposals          from contractors for a new alternative to detention program called the          Intensive Supervision Appearance Program (ISAP). ISAP is slated to be          implemented by DHS in 2004 in 8 cities, and program participants are to          include “up to 200 immigrant adult asylum seekers, non-criminal          aliens, and aliens on an Order of Supervision who would otherwise be held          in secure custody and who are required by law to be held in the legal          custody of the DHS.”

According to DHS materials:

 The program will target adult illegal immigrants that would otherwise            be held in secure custody but can show they are not at risk of violent            behavior and/or absconding, and have family or other appropriate sponsorship            to guarantee their release.
ISAP is designed to insure attendance at immigration hearings and            will provide “highly structured and closely supervised”            Orders of Supervision for 200 participants per year at each of the following            designated sites: Baltimore, Denver, Kansas City (MO), Miami, Philadelphia,            Portland, San Francisco, and St. Paul.
 The program will include frequent reporting, home visits, and monitoring            of daily activities through electronic monitoring devices.

Non-governmental organizations have a range of concerns about the ISAP          program, including its call for the use of electronic monitoring devises          for some participants. Advocacy organizations are also concerned that          the program may be applied to immigrants who would otherwise be released          from detention without supervision, instead of to detainees who would          not otherwise be released. In response to these concerns, DHS has stated          that it “does not intend to utilize the ISAP to ‘widen the          net’ for persons that would normally be released anyway. It is designed          to improve appearance rates at immigration hearings for those persons          that would otherwise be held in secure detention.”

With respect to the choice of the eight sites, DHS materials state that          “The process was part of an internal management review of offices          to determine the viability of the program in the field.” The DHS          materials released regarding ISAP do not explain why New York and New          Jersey were excluded from ISAP – particularly as these areas include          two of the largest detention centers for asylum seekers in the US, the          200-bed Wackenhut facility in Queens, New York and the 300-bed CCA facility          in Elizabeth, New Jersey.

Human Rights First Issues New Report on US Law and Security Policy

The attached new report by Human Rights First, “Assessing          the New Normal,” examines changes to U.S. law and security policy          in five areas: government openness; personal privacy; immigration; security-related          detention; and the effect of U.S. actions on international human rights          standards. The report concludes that while certain changes in law and          policy have been sensible and constructive, many others threaten basic          rights and freedoms, and taken together reflect a significant departure          from rule of law principles. The report highlights how what it terms the          “new normal” has meant a diminution of legal safeguards, a          breakdown of the system of checks and balances (in particular, judicial          oversight of executive branch decisions), and a reduction in government          openness and accountability. Each chapter contains a set of policy recommendations—including          calls for increased congressional oversight, rolling back certain provisions          of the USA PATRIOT Act, and close scrutiny of additional measures being          proposed by the President and Attorney General John Ashcroft.
