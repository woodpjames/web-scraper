Helen Thomas Stays on the Case
May 05, 2008
Helen Thomas continues to call the Bush Administration on its lies about torture.  Check out her piece in today's Albany Times Union where she pointedly asks what Congress, the presidential candidates, and all of us plan to do to achieve change and accountability.  Also, read this post for a lively discussion of her recent grilling of the White House press secretary.  Here are her key questions:Is Congress so cowed that it accepts the statements of a President who has little regard for the truth?Is there no lawmaker who is appalled about the tarnishing of our image in world opinion? And where are the voices of the other presidential candidates who will inherit the Bush legacy of torture? Why the silence?I count on the American people to refuse to be shamed any more.
