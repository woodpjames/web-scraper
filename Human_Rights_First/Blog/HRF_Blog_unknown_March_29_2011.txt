CNN's Special Comes at a Crucial Time for American Muslims
March 29, 2011
The latest installment of the CNN In America series profiles the Muslim community in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, which faced a wave of intolerance and experienced numerous setbacks when the community announced plans to build a house of worship. Human Rights First reported the case last summer, and we applaud Soledad O'Brien's team for further investigating the story in Unwelcome: The Muslims Next Door.

The timing of the CNN special couldn't be better, as other American Muslims are facing intolerance, bigotry, and even discrimination and violence. Today's congressional hearing convened by Senator Durbin (D-IL) examines the civil rights of American Muslims. Read Human Rights First's submission for the record, in which we argue that America must not falter on rights of Muslim Americans.
