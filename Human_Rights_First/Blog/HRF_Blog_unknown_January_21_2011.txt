Ghailani Verdict Upheld: Former Gitmo Detainee Sentencing Next Week
January 21, 2011
As predicted, the conviction of Ahmed Khalfan  Ghailani, the first Guantanamo detainee to be transferred to the  United States for  trial, was upheld  this morning by a federal court judge in New York.

Judge Lewis Kaplan this morning issued  a 56-page opinion explaining why he’s convinced there is sufficient evidence  to support Ghailani’s conviction on one count of Conspiracy to Destroy  Government Property, and why there  were no errors at trial that prejudiced the jury against the  defendant.

As I explained  yesterday, Ghailani’s lawyers  argued that there was insufficient evidence to support the one count on which he  was convicted, that the verdict was  internally inconsistent, and that the  judge made a prejudicial error in charging the  jury.

Judge Kaplan rejected all of those  arguments today. Ghailani faces 25 years to life in prison. His sentencing  hearing begins next Tuesday.

Since the terrorist attacks of  September 11, 2001, more than 400 people have been convicted on  terrorism-related charges in U.S. federal courts.  Only five have  been convicted in military commissions.

For some inexplicable reason, the Obama administration intends to resume prosecutions in the Guantanamo Bay military commissions.
