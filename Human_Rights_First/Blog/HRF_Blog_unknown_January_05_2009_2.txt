Reported Obama CIA Nominee Recognizes the Cost of Torture
January 05, 2009
Statement of Elisa Massimino
We welcome the news that President-elect Obama has reportedly selected Leon Panetta, someone who recognizes that "torture is illegal, immoral, dangerous and counterproductive" to lead the CIA. If the United States is to regain its moral authority and bolster our national security, it will be necessary to implement a single standard of humane treatment for all detainees in U.S. custody. As CIA Director, Mr. Panetta will have a lead role in implementing the promises made by President-elect Obama to put an end to the current Administration's policies of torture and abuse.
