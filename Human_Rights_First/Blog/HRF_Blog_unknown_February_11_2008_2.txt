HRF on the Loss of Congressman Lantos
February 11, 2008
Congressman Tom Lantos dedicated his life to the fight for human rights, a dedication born out of his own life experience as a holocaust survivor. Throughout his 28 years in Congress, Congressman Lantos was a passionate advocate for human rights and freedom. A co-founder of the Congressional Human Rights Caucus, he helped put human rights issues on the Congressional map. While we did not agree with him on every issue, we always knew where he stood, and we respected his passion, his commitment and his dedication to the cause of global justice. The human rights community has lost an important friend.
