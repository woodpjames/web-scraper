Human Rights First Praises President Obama's Commitment to U.S. Human Rights Leadership
September 23, 2010
New York City – Following President Barack Obama's speech  before the United Nations General Assembly, Human Rights First's Elisa  Massimino issued the following statement:

"At a time when many Americans are struggling economically, President  Obama made a powerful case for why universal respect for human rights  is central to U.S. national interests, and to the peace and security of  the world. As the President said, our nation's commitment to human  rights is a ‘matter of moral and pragmatic necessity.' Having made that  case so clearly, the President then set out concrete commitments about  what the United States will stand for around the world—engaging with  civil society, condemning those who would restrict free expression,  advancing freedom and the space for dissent in the virtual public  square, and promoting and expanding the rights of civil society.  Each  of these commitments will require dedicated attention, fortitude, and  action.  If the administration can deliver on them, it will mean real  change for millions of people at home and around the world, and will go a  long way towards re-establishing the United States as a global leader  on human rights. We look forward to working with the administration as  it sees this mission through."
