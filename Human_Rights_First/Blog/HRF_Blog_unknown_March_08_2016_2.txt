Human Rights First will Highlight Human Trafficking at SXSW 2016
March 08, 2016
We're headed to Austin for SXSW Interactive 2016! We hope you'll join us on Sunday, March 13 at 5:00 p.m. for a panel discussion on, "How to Fight Modern Slavery with Data Analysis." The panel will take place in the JW Marriott room 303-304 and is open to all Interactive, Gold, and Platinum badge holders. Human trafficking is the fastest growing criminal enterprise in the world, a booming $150 billion industry that entraps an estimated 20.9 people worldwide. Many of its victims hide in plain sight—but hard evidence of trafficking can be difficult to pin down. The key to bankrupting this business may be buried online, hiding amongst the data captured by many companies every day. In this session, experts will discuss how they have discovered small indicators lurking in big data to help identify human traffickers and how tech firms, financial companies, and law enforcement can work together to bring them to justice. Moderated by Human Rights First's Elisa Massimino, the panel will include: Human Rights First will also co-sponsor a special installation with the Red Sand Project as part of the SXgood Hub. The installation will provoke people to question, connect, and take action against human trafficking. Be sure to stop by! Follow Human Rights First at SXSW on twitter: @humanrights1st.
