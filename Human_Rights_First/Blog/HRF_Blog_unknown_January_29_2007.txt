Robert Drinan, S.J., a Giant of Human Rights, Dies
January 29, 2007
Human Rights First mourns the passing of Rev. Robert Drinan, a former member of our Board of Directors and a giant in the world of human rights. Father Drinan combined a passionate commitment to human rights and social justice with a fierce determination to speak truth to power. His was a clear and consistent voice of conscience on a wide range of human rights issues, ranging from the plight of Soviet Jewry to Central America, from Cuba to Darfur. As we continue our work, we are inspired by his life and many good deeds. We have lost a great leader and good friend.
