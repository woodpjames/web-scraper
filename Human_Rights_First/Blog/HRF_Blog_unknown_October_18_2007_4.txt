Judge Mukasey "Too General" on Torture
October 18, 2007
From today's New York Times editorial:Mr. Mukaseyâ€™s discussion of torture was good as far as it went, but it was too general. The administration has said that it opposes torture, but what matters is how it defines torture. It is important for Mr. Mukasey to oppose not only the word torture, but acts that properly fall under the label.We'll be listening today to hear if Judge Mukasey can assure us that he would uphold the law if he is confirmed.  Hopefully, we'll hear him provide more specifics on what he believes constitutes torture.
