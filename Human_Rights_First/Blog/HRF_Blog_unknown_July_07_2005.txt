Human Rights First Condemns the Tragic Attacks in London
July 07, 2005
Human Rights First condemns the tragic attacks in London early Thursday July 7 and extends its sympathy to the people of the United Kingdom. We grieve for the loss of innocent lives and hope for the recovery of those injured. The attacks are a gross violation of human rights, without any justification, and must be punished. Human Rights First calls for justice to be effected in a fair and deliberate manner.
