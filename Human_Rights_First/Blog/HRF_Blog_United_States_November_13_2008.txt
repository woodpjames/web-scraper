Don’t Bring Guantanamo to the United States
November 13, 2008
Although we noted yesterday that Obama’s team has denied any intention to establish some form of preventive detention, my colleague Sharon Kelly has further strong arguments against such a move in The Hill’s Congress Blog, writing, based on her observations at Guantanamo, that “how terrorists are tried is as important as where they are tried”:By announcing his intention to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay and bring to justice suspected terrorists held there, President-elect Obama would send an important message that the United States will again be a global leader on human rights. But closing Guantanamo only to bring it home to the United States would be taking one step forward followed by two steps back. Among the many lessons learned from the misguided Guantanamo episode is that new, ad hoc justice systems are prone to fail.
