NYT: Support the Troops by Ending Detainee Abuse
August 30, 2007
Today's New York Times editorial page reacts to the accountability gap remaining after the verdict this week in the last of the Abu Ghraib trials:The need to be honest about Abu Ghraib and correct the abuses at military and C.I.A. prisons is not only about upholding the law and American values. It is about the safety of American soldiers. Every right the United States denies to its detainees may one day be denied to Americans captured in wartime. Every abuse the United States visits on detainees increases the risk of American soldiers being abused in foreign prisons.If humanity and law are not reasons enough to end the detainee abuse, then it should be done for the cause that Mr. Bush invokes daily: supporting the troops.
