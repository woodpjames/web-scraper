14 Interrogators Call on Secretary Gates to Eliminate Appendix M to the Army Field Manual
November 17, 2010
Washington, D.C. – More than a dozen former interrogators have told Secretary of Defense Robert Gates that a 2006 regulation human rights advocates have long sought to  overturn may severely hamper the ability of U.S. interrogators to  question terrorism suspects and individuals captured on the battlefield.

In a letter to Gates, 14 interrogators – including those who have  questioned high level Al Qaeda suspects and led the nation's high value  detainee interrogation operations – note that the restrictions "make it  very difficult, in all but the most sensitive situations, for U.S.  interrogators to create an environment of trust and protection that is  often necessary to gain the cooperation of certain detainees, especially  those who have been identified as 'high value.'"

At issue is an appendix added to the manual in 2006. The  interrogators wrote to Gates that the appendix – known as Appendix M –  "places unnecessary restrictions on an effective interrogation technique  known as 'separation.'" Since it was adopted, rights advocates have  asked the Pentagon to eliminate the appendix, noting that it contains  guidelines that could be construed as permitting U.S. interrogators to  use sleep deprivation and sensory deprivation techniques on high value  detainees. The interrogators urged Gates to eliminate the appendix  altogether.

Signatories to the letter include Ali Soufan, a leading FBI  interrogator who questioned high level Al Qaeda suspects such as Abu  Zubaydah; Steve Kleinman, a leading author of the 2006 Defense Science  Board Educing Information report which the Obama administration  has used to help chart interrogation policy; and COL Stuart Herrington,  an intelligence officer who ran high value detainee interrogation  operations for the U.S. Army in Vietnam, Panama, and Iraq
