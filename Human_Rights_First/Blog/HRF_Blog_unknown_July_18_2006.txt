Human Rights First to Testify before Senate Armed Services Committee
July 18, 2006
Elisa Massimino, Washington Director of Human Rights First, will testify before the Senate Armed Services Committee tomorrow morning as it continues to hold hearings relating to the procedures for trying detainees held at Guantanamo Bay.
Human Rights First has been a key player in the debate over military commissions and U.S. detention policy since Sept. 11 and has frequently sent staff to observe commission proceedings in Guantanamo.
Massimino is an expert on U.S. compliance with international human rights laws and has testified before Congress on several occasions.
