More Bush Admin Memos Offer Up a Defense for Torturers
July 24, 2008
The ACLU today  released three documents -- in essence, three  additional "Torture Memos" from 2002-04 -- that the Bush administration has  refused to disclose before now.  The ACLU obtained the documents  through its continuing Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) litigation against the  administration.To say the Bush  administration has finally now "disclosed" these memos actually is a bit of an  overstatement.  Government censors have been busy:  Perhaps 95%  or more of the two multi-page documents in the set -- an 18-page August 1, 2002,  Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) memo to the CIA, and a  3-page January 23, 2003, CIA memo to OLC -- are entirely  redacted.But even with all  that's been cut, there is still enough here that is troubling.  As early  media reports have pointed out -- such as this  one from the Associated Press -- the August 2002 OLC memo purports to  give CIA interrogators a "good faith" defense to criminal prosecution for  torture so long as they do not believe their cruel techniques would cause "prolonged mental harm."  Perhaps even more ominous is the January  2003 CIA memo, which suggests that CIA agents anywhere in the world have  blanket permission to use both standard and "enhanced" interrogation techniques  -- collectively labeled in the memo as the "Permissible Interrogation  Techniques."More ominous still?  In stating that these  "Permissible Interrogation Techniques" are all that CIA agents may use  "[u]nless otherwise approved" by CIA headquarters, the memo suggests  that at the CIA there has been some category of interrogation techniques  even more enhanced than the known "enhanced" techniques -- such as  waterboarding -- that themselves are clearly torture.   What were these  people doing?
