Human Rights First, conservative thinkers, religious leaders, and  other human rights advocates are calling on the Obama Administration to end the bureaucratic delays and the needless suffering of law-abiding people and their families already victimized by persecution.

At this event, Human Rights First's Elisa Massimino joined an impressive group of speakers, including Kevin Appleby of U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, Galen Carey of the National Association of Evangelicals, Barrett Duke of the Southern Baptist Convention, Wendy Wright of Concerned Women for America, Michael Horowitz of Hudson Institute, and Melanie Nezer of the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society.
