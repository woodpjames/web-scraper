Let your senator know that you agree with him â€“ write today in support of a hate crimes bill expected to come to vote very soon. In the same hearing, Holder referred to the awaited report from the Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) investigating the development of legal advice that authorized torture.The Washington Post quotes Human Rights First in an article covering the hearing:"The American people have a right to know how the U.S. Justice Departmentcame to issue legal opinions approving acts of cruelty that shocked the world,damaged U.S. moral authority and harmed efforts to combat terrorismeffectively," according to a letter from Human Rights First and more than ahalf-dozen other activist groups. "Requests for release of the OPR report havebeen met with excessive delay and insufficient explanations. We urge you torelease the OPR report now and send a clear message that transparency ingovernment and adherence to the law are core American values as well as keyassets to U.S. national security."
