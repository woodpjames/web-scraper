October 29, 2008
On October 23, 2008, at the University of Virginia Law School retired military leaders Lieutenant General Harry E. Soyster and Lieutenant General Charles Otstott discussed the importance of using interrogation methods that are effective, lawful and humane, and the importance of the commander-in-chief setting the highest standards for all U.S. personnel in the treatment of prisoners."It doesn't matter what they do, itâ€™s what we do. We don't lower ourselves to the level of this terrible enemy we are fighting. It's about what our standards are." - General Soyster"The rules are the same, and should be the same. All the Machiavellian work that has been done to get around those rules is detestable, and I can't believe we are doing that as an official policy in the United States of America." - General Otstott Read about it and watch the video here.
