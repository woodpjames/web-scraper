July 31, 2006
NEW YORK, NY – Human Rights First (HRF) today announced the appointment of Henry Griggs as the organization’s new Director of Communications.
For the last four years, Griggs served as Communications Director at the DC-based Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.  At CBPP, he effectively promoted the organization’s policy work in key public debates on issues including heath, nutrition, housing, tax credits, and other tax and budget policies affecting low-income people.  
“Henry joins us at a critical time in the public debate over how our country defines human rights,” said HRF Executive Director Maureen Byrnes.  “His extensive communications experience in progressive policy issues, commitment to social justice, and reputation among national and state media will be vital to us as Human Rights First tackles the challenges that lie ahead.” 
In 1988, Griggs co-founded the Communications Consortium Media Center, a nonprofit consultancy, where he worked on policy-related media campaigns for a range of national nonprofit groups.  Since then, he has consulted with foundations and nonprofits, conducted public opinion research, and worked at public relations agencies.
Griggs is co-author of the "Jossey-Bass Guide to Strategic Communications for Nonprofits", published in 1999 and now in its third printing. He was previously with the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, where he produced radio and television programming and assisted organizing and legislative campaigns in 35 states.   He was also Assistant to the Political Editor at CBS News in New York.
 Griggs has an A.B. in philosophy from Harvard University.
