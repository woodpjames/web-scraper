Judge Mukasey Doesn't Comment on Waterboarding
October 17, 2007
From the Judiciary Committee Hearing right now:   Judge Mukasey declined to make comments on waterboarding in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, saying that too little is known about its use.  However, he did say: "I would be uncomfortable with any trial that uses evidence that's been coerced."
