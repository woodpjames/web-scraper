Haitian Asylum Seekers Selectively Targeted by US Detention and Interdiction Policies

U.S. Government Must Change Discriminatory Policies

On October 29, 2002 more than 200 Haitian men, women and children                swam ashore near Key Biscayne, Florida. They remain detained in                INS custody. Even though they are eligible for release on bond,                the INS has refused to set bond for these Haitians, and is invoking                a controversial post September 11 regulation to keep them detained                even when an immigration judge determines that they can be released.

Earlier this week, the U.S. Coast Guard announced on Tuesday that                it would step up its efforts to interdict Haitians and other migrants                attempting to reach U.S. shores illegally. At the same time, 19                Haitians who had failed to reach U.S. shores were returned to Haiti                without being given the chance to apply for asylum.

Discriminatory Detention: INS Invokes Controversial Post                9-11 regulation to keep Haitian asylum seekers detained even if                judge decides they can be released 

After a boat carrying about 170 Haitian asylum seekers arrived in                Florida in December 2001, the INS instituted a separate parole policy                directing that Haitian asylum seekers not generally be released                on parole. Other asylum seekers in Florida are routinely paroled.                Now, in response to the arrival of the most recent boat on October                29, the INS is again taking a discriminatory approach to the detention                of Haitian asylum seekers.

The INS is reportedly invoking a controversial new regulation –                a change that was made by the Department of Justice on October 26,                2001 in the wake of the September 11 attacks. The new regulation                gives INS trial attorneys the power to, in essence, overrule an                immigration judge’s decision to release an immigration detainee                on bond. This overly broad provision can be invoked where there                is absolutely no suspicion of criminal or terrorist activity, and                was immediately applied to Arab and Muslim non-citizens who were                detained in the wake of September 11, leading to prolonged periods                of detention. The INS is now threatening to use this overly broad                power to detain asylum seekers for what will likely end up being                prolonged periods of time. The INS has also refused to set bond                for these asylum seekers.

The INS’s treatment of Haitian asylum seekers – which                in effect deprives them of an individual determination and treats                them in a discriminatory manner – violates due process and                international law.

Discriminatory Interdiction: Is the US Government Returning                Haitian Refugees to Face Persecution?

As noted above, the U.S. Coast Guard announced yesterday that it                would step up its efforts to interdict Haitian and other migrants                who attempt to come to the U.S. illegally. At the same time, the                U.S. reportedly returned the 19 Haitians who had failed to reach                shore to Haiti.

Political violence is on the rise in Haiti, and it is not surprising                that those in danger feel the need to flee. The United States is                obliged, under international law, not to return people to a country                where their lives or freedom would be threatened on account of their                political opinions. But how can the U.S. be sure that the Haitians                it is returning are not in danger of persecution when it does not                conduct any screening of the Haitians it returns?

Under U.S. procedures, migrants who are interdicted on boats are                not given access to lawyers and are not all screened to make sure                that they are not refugees who are in danger of persecution if returned.                While Cuban migrants are read a statement in Spanish notifying them                that they may come forward and speak with a U.S. representative                if they have any concerns and Chinese migrants are provided with                a written questionnaire, Haitian and other migrants are not provided                with any indication, written or oral, that they can express their                fears about being returned. Even if a Haitian asylum seeker should                voice a fear of persecution, the U.S. government does not require                that translators be present on every interdicted boat so their fears                may never be heard.

Take Action!

Human Rights First has urged that the INS: (1) stop discriminating                against Haitian asylum seekers and treat them fairly; and (2) ensure                that Haitian asylum seekers are given genuinely individualized detention                determinations – instead of determinations that are simply                a charade. Human Rights First has also urged that all individuals                who are interdicted on boats by the U.S. government be individually                apprised, in a language that they understand, that they can express                any fears or concerns about being returned to their home country.                Anyone who does indicate a fear should be interviewed by a trained                INS asylum officer.
