Eliminate the Arbitrary One-Year Bar to Asylum
April 22, 2010
Human Rights First, along with 86 other faith-based, human rights, legal  services and refugee assistance organizations and 81 individual asylum  law practitioners, pro bono attorneys, law professors and other experts,  sent a letter to members of the U.S. House of Representatives urging  them to support H.R. 4800, the Restoring Protection to Victims of  Persecution Act, eliminating the one-year deadline for filing asylum  applications. The one year deadline is a technical requirement that has  led to the denial, rejection, or delay of thousands of requests for  asylum protection in the United States and created unnecessary  inefficiencies in the asylum adjudication process.
