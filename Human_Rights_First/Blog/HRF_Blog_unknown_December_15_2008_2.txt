Supreme Court Decision to Revive Guant
December 15, 2008
Sharon Kelly, We Can End Torture Now Campaign Manager at Human Rights First, issued the following statement on the revival of the Rasul case:
The Supreme Court's decision to revive a lawsuit brought by four British men who claim they were tortured at Guantanamo provides the plaintiffs with a chance for justice and the public with an opportunity to learn how policies that undermined American interests and tarnished our reputation came to be embraced.
