Proposed Amendment Would Hamper Ability to Get Actionable Intelligence
February 02, 2010
Washington, DC  Responding to today's announcement that Senator Lindsey Graham plans to introduce legislation that would block funding for civilian trials for five accused 9/11 terrorists currently held at the U.S. detention facility at Guantanamo, Human Rights First's Devon Chaffee issued the following statement:
"Senator Graham's efforts to hamstring law enforcement would hamper our ability to obtain actionable intelligence from terrorism suspects and to bring them to justice.  Hundreds of terror suspects have been interrogated by the FBI and tried in civilian courts since 9/11. Such suspects have given critical information about al-Qaida sleeper cells within the United States, training camps in Afghanistan, and details about high-level terrorism suspects such as Khalid Sheik Mohammed."
