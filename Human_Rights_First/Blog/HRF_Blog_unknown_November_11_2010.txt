Statement of Elisa Massimino on Federal Trials for Alleged Terrorists
November 11, 2010
"Bringing KSM and the rest of the Guantanamo detainees to face  justice in federal court is the right thing to do for those cases, for  our justice system, and for America's long term interests in combatting  extremism.

"If President Obama uses his recent political losses as an excuse for  inaction, he will demonstrate not only that he has lost a midterm  election, but that he intends to abdicate his responsibility as  President to lead.

"Last week, Secretary Hillary Clinton spoke forcefully about the need  for the country, and individuals, to be confident and brave in the face  of the world's inherent risk.

"We've got to get about the business of reshaping the future. That's  what America is about. I run around the world talking to people in  countries who can't get over the past. They can't move on. They are  paralyzed. That's not us and we need to act like the Americans that are  fearless and focused on building a better tomorrow.

"President Obama must not let fear of political opposition make him too timid to do what is right."
