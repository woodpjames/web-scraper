Jury Convicts First Guantanamo Detainee in New York Federal District Court
November 18, 2010
Predictions of Chaos Surrounding Trial Fail To Materialize
New York, NY – Today, a jury seated in the federal District  Court for the Southern District of New York, convicted Guantanamo  detainee Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani of conspiracy for assisting in the 1998  bombings of U.S. embassies in East Africa that killed 224 people and  wounded hundreds more.

Following the verdict, which caries a potential sentence of life in  prison, Human Rights First's Daphne Eviatar, who has been in the  courtroom monitoring the case, said, "The questions today's verdict  raise are why the government has not tried all terror suspects in  federal court and when will the government announce additional  prosecutions.  I have watched the hearings at Guantanamo and Ghailani's  trial in New York.  What strikes me is how efficient, fair, and  transparent the federal court prosecution was in contrast to the recent  Khadr decision at Guantanamo which left one with the uneasy feeling of  justice gone awry.  The military commissions remain rife with  constitutional defects.  Federal courts have far more legal tools to  prosecute terror suspects."

According to the Department of Justice, federal courts have convicted  more than 400 terror suspects since 9/11.  With the recent plea deal of  Omar Khadr, the child soldier at Guantanamo, military commissions now  have convicted five.  In Washington, D.C., Republican leaders including  Rep. Bohener have insisted that the Obama Administration try suspects at  Guantanamo.

Unnamed Administration officials this weekend signaled that due to  political opposition, Khalid Sheik Mohammed would not be tried in either  a federal court or a military commission, but instead detained  indefinitely under the laws of war. Eviatar said, "Bringing KSM and the  rest of the Guantanamo detainees to face justice in federal court is the  right thing to do for those cases, for our justice system, and for  America's long-term interests in combating terrorism. The failure to  bring to justice some of the most heinous criminals in U.S. history is a  disservice to this country. If President Obama uses his recent  political losses as an excuse for inaction, he will demonstrate not only  that he has lost a midterm election, but that he intends to abdicate  his responsibility as President to lead.  President Obama must not let  fear of political opposition make him too timid to do what is right."

Critics of federal court trials for terror suspects had warned that  holding the trial in New York City would lead to chaos. For example, in a conference call with reporters arranged by the Republican National Committee, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani noted, "It would be safer if somebody like (Ghailani) were tried in military court."

According to The Wall Street Journal, however, "Federal  officials say the New York Police Department...asked for no financial  help to buttress security around the federal courthouse in Lower  Manhattan...[and]...there will be no street closures or extra officers  assigned to security outside the courthouse."

Human Rights First conducted its own interviews of New Yorkers  outside the courtroom and found the attitude to be business as usual.   Here is a link to Human Right's First video: http://www.youtube.com/user/HumanRightsFirstOrg#p/a/u/2/6I-W3JXAHBU

Eviatar concluded, "The Obama Administration should act now to  prosecute other terror suspects who remain at Guantanamo in federal  court – a system that has proven much more successful and adept than  commissions."

The Critics Arguments Didn't Add Up

Marc Thiessen called the trial a "catastrophe of [AG Eric Holder's] own making" in the Washington Post.
Liz Cheney claimed,  "By insisting on trying Ahmed Ghailani in civilian court with full  constitutional rights, instead of by military commission, President  Obama and Attorney General Holder are jeopardizing the prosecution of a  terrorist who killed 224 people at U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania  ... If the American people needed any further proof that this  Administration's policy of treating terrorism like a law enforcement  matter is irresponsible and reckless, they received it today."
In the National Review Andrew McCarthy speculated that an earlier ruling had destroyed the government's case.

The final word:

"The NYPD is saying that he's not a great security risk," says Julie  Menin, president of the neighborhood community board. "The Foley  Courthouse has tried many terrorist suspects over the years."[8]
