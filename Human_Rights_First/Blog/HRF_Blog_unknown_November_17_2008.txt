Obama on 60 Minutes: Regaining America's Moral Stature
November 17, 2008
President-elect Obama spoke about ending torture and closing Guantanamo on 60 Minutes last night:"I have said repeatedly that I intend to close Guantanamo, and I will follow through on that. I have said repeatedly that America doesn't torture, and I’m going to make sure that we don’t torture. Those are part and parcel of an effort to regain America’s moral stature in the world."[[{"type":"media","view_mode":"media_large","fid":"41","attributes":{"class":"media-image","typeof":"foaf:Image","height":"344","width":"425","style":""}}]]
