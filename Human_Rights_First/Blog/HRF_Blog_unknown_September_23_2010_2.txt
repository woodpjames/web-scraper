House Testimony Echoes Concerns about Contractor Escalation without Oversight, Accountability Fixes
September 23, 2010
Washington, DC – Today, the Commission on Wartime  Contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan testified before the House Committee  on Government Oversight and Reform and raised serious concerns  regarding State Department's need to more than double its private  security contractors from 2,700 to 7,000 in Iraq by the time the U.S.  military withdraws. The testimony echoed concerns raised by Human Rights  First in its report "State of Affairs: Three Years After Nisoor Square –  Accountability and Oversight of U.S. Private Security and Other  Contractors."

Commission Co-Chairman Michael Thibault testified that "[e]ven if  State could obtain the funds for more than doubling its private-security  force, it is not clear that it has the trained personnel to manage and  oversee contract performance of a kind that has already shown the  potential for creating tragic incidents and frayed relations with host  countries."

Additionally, Human Rights First's newly released report found, in  part, that legal clarification of criminal jurisdiction over State  contractors in Iraq is urgently needed. To date, there remains a serious  gap in the law that does not give U.S. courts criminal jurisdiction  over all private security contractors employed by the State Department.   The group notes that it is imperative that the Obama administration and  Congress work together to pass the Civilian Extraterritorial  Jurisdiction Act, legislation designed to bridge that gap.  The United  States has a responsibility and a national security interest to ensure  that when it fields contractors abroad it provides effective oversight  to protect civilians from harm and hold contractors accountable for  serious crimes committed.
