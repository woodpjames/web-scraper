Huffington Post piece on prosecuting terrorist suspects in federal courts
July 09, 2009
David Laufman, an attorney experienced in prosecuting terrorism cases, writes in the Huffington Post today on why Guantanamo detainees should be transferred to U.S. criminal courts.On why to try them in federal courts:Prosecutions in the criminal justice system confer greater credibility onthe government's handling of these cases. Domestically, that credibility helpsto foster political consensus about the legitimacy of the government's approachto counterterrorism; overseas, it helps to promote critical cooperation byforeign intelligence and law enforcement authorities.And on why Congress's efforts to derail bringing Gitmo detainees into the U.S.:These legislative restrictions on the President's discretion are based onthe belief that terrorists cannot be detained safely on U.S. soil. But thatbelief is grossly mistaken. Both before and after the attacks of September11, 2001, a rogues' gallery of dangerous terrorists successfully have beendetained for long periods in the United States in localities across thecountry...None of these facilities was ever attacked while a defendant was incarceratedthere on terrorism-related charges, and no such detainee has ever escaped.Moreover, most of these terrorists are now safely serving their sentences at theimpregnable "Supermax" facility operated by the federal Bureau of Prisons inFlorence, Colorado. Congress irresponsibly has ignored this history of experience. Read the whole piece to see how he backs this up with particular cases.
