Senate Beats Back White House Pro-Torture Public Relations Push
February 13, 2008
This afternoon, the Senate joined the House to pass legislation applying the Army Field Manual standards of interrogation to the CIA.  This vote marks a major step toward putting an end to policies that have allowed for torture and official cruelty by U.S. officials.  Although this vote shows that the recent public relations push from the Administration aimed at gaining support for its illegal use of waterboarding is failing, President Bush is threatening to veto this legislation.
