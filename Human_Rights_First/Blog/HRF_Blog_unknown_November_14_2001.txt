Refugee Resettlement in the United States                Blocked, Stranding 22,000 Refugees
Only the President's Signature is Needed                to Lift the Moratorium

The U.S. government has essentially stopped                the resettlement of refugees in this country since the September                11 attacks. That has stranded more than 20,000 refugees who had                already been screened and accepted to come to the United States.                Many had been given a long-awaited travel date and even tickets                that were cancelled at the last minute. Many refugees are trapped                in homeless limbo after giving up their old living quarters, unable                to come to new homes or to join people who await them.

In Clarkston, Georgia, a 7-year-old Afghan boy                with a rare blood disease was expecting the arrival of his 20-year-old                sister, apparently the only perfect bone marrow match in his family.                His sister has been approved to come to the United States as a refugee                but there is no news on when she may be able to travel, said Clare                Richie, regional director for the Atlanta office of the International                Rescue Committee.

In Moline, Illinois, an Afghan mother and her                family of five children were warmly awaited in September, but they                are now "somewhere in Pakistan," said Ann Grove, director of the                World Relief office in Moline. Grove, her colleagues and the volunteers                who were to help settle the refugees are worried and disheartened.                They are unable to get more information about the Afghan family                of six, or about two other families they were expecting. Items from                the families' dismantled homes-to-have-been sit in Grove's office                now - including food and the headboard of a double bed.

Grove and her colleagues have particular reason                to be worried. The International Rescue Committee has reported that                other refugees who had expected to come to the United States, now                stranded in Pakistan, are living in fear for their lives because                of strong anti-American sentiment in parts of that country.

Who Are the Stranded Refugees?

Such refugees are, in most cases, displaced                people who have lived for years in refugee camps. Before they can                be accepted for resettlement, overseas refugees are interviewed                and screened by officials of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization                Service. Many refugees wait years for an interview, while living                in a refugee camp. The long and arduous road to refugee resettlement                is not an easy option for those seeking to harm U.S. citizens. Ironically,                now that Americans are concerned that some non-citizens entering                the United States may pose a threat, we are excluding only the group                that has been screened.

Among the 20,000 refugees who have already been                approved to travel are many religious minorities, and women and                children at risk. In many cases, as in parts of Pakistan, the fact                that refugees have been approved to travel to the United States                exposes them to greater danger.

Why Are The Refugees Stranded?

There are two reasons for the virtual moratorium,                as reported in an excellent front-page article in the New York Times                of October 29: security concerns, and the fact that the U.S. government                has so far neglected to set a new annual ceiling for the number                of refugees to be accepted. The document that sets this number,                called the Presidential Determination or PD, is usually signed at                the beginning of each fiscal year. Until it is signed, almost no                new refugees may be admitted.

This year, the process has also included a "security                review" of the resettlement program, by an interagency task force                including the Department of Justice and Department of State, according                to the U.S. Committee for Refugees. The Committee reports that although                the Bush Administration has released very little information about                the review, it is believed that the review will lead to more detailed                background checks of refugee applicants, and "longer pre- and post-arrival                processing times in general." Administration officials said this                week that the review has been completed, so it is no longer an obstacle                to lifting the moratorium.

The unsigned PD, as written, would cut the figure                down to 70,000 - the lowest resettlement ceiling in more than a                decade. That number would be nearly a 50 percent drop in approved                numbers since 1992. And because of the two months in which there                has been almost no resettlement, and in which INS officers have                interviewed very few new applicants, far fewer than 70,000 refugees                are likely to be resettled this year - even if the PD were signed                today.

Please contact the White House and ask the                President to lift the moratorium immediately, by signing the Presidential                Determination. Call (202-456-1111) or fax (202-456-2461).
