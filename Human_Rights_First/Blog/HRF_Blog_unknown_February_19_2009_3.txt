General Johns: "President Obama... is thoroughly knowledgeable of what he's doing and the consequences."
February 19, 2009
Residents of Loudon County, in the D.C. metro area, were treated to a special profile (printed in the Loudon extra section of the Washington Post) of Brigadier General John H. Johns, a member of Human Rights First's coalition of retired military leaders, who was with President Obama as he signed the executive orders last month. General Johns, a resident of Leisure World, praised the President for sending a message that the United States would no longer tolerate torture as an interrogation tactic. "It was clearly a high item on his agenda," General Johns said. "It signals a new era."
