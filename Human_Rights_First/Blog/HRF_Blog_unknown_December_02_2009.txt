President Obama on U.S. values, Guantanamo, and human rights
December 02, 2009
In President Obama's speech last night, a clear call to returning to American values and human rights, reminding why he ended torture and will close Guantanamo:Finally, we must draw on the strength of our values – for the challenges that weface may have changed, but the things that we believe in must not. That is whywe must promote our values by living them at home – which is why I haveprohibited torture and will close the prison at Guantanamo Bay. And we must makeit clear to every man, woman and child around the world who lives under the darkcloud of tyranny that America will speak out on behalf of their human rights,and tend to the light of freedom, and justice, and opportunity, and respect forthe dignity of all peoples. That is who we are. That is the moral source ofAmerica’s authority.Get involved.
