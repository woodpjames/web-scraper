Take          Action Now! Urge US Department of Homeland Security to Improve Detention          Procedures for Asylum Seekers  

“Chasing Freedom,” an original Court TV Film to be aired in          January, tells the story of a young Afghan woman (played by Layla Alizada)          who is persecuted by the Taliban for running a school for young girls          and the pro bono attorney (played by Juliette Lewis) who reluctantly takes          on her asylum case after the woman is detained when she arrives at a U.S.          airport in search of refuge.

The film was inspired by a real asylum case handled by a team of dedicated          pro bono attorneys for Human Rights First, and Human Rights First provided expertise on asylum and detention issues to          Court TV while the screenplay was being written. It is a sobering depiction          of the nearly insurmountable obstacles that asylum seekers face when they          arrive in the U.S.

The young refugee woman portrayed in the film, like so many asylum seekers,          arrived in the U.S. without proper documents and was detained by immigration          authorities upon her arrival at a U.S. airport. In the last two years,          at least 15,300 asylum seekers have been subject to detention at U.S.          airports and borders. They are transported to jails and detention facilities          often in handcuffs, and often without any clear understanding of why they          are being detained. In detention, once they pass a screening interview,          asylum seekers are legally eligible to be paroled if they satisfy the          INS, now DHS (Department of Homeland Security), parole criteria for asylum          seekers – criteria which include community ties, no risk to the          community, and that identity can be established.

But, in practice, even asylum seekers who meet these criteria continue          to be detained. Immigration officials too often ignore or selectively          apply the parole criteria, which exist only in guideline form rather than          formal regulations. And, as is dramatically represented in the film Chasing          Freedom, when an asylum seeker’s parole request is denied by DHS          officials, they have no meaningful recourse – they cannot appeal          the decision to an independent authority, or even an immigration judge.

TAKE ACTION

Human Rights First is recommending that the Department of Homeland          Security make some concrete changes to improve the fairness of detention          procedures so that they are consistent with the U.S. tradition of protecting          the persecuted. We urge that the Department:

Create a new high-level refugee protection position in DHS Secretary            Tom Ridge’s Office;
 Give asylum seekers the chance to appeal parole denials to immigration            judges; and
 Put the existing parole guidelines into formal regulations that must            be applied by DHS.

For further background on these issues, read several reports issued by Human Rights First.
