Human Rights First Calls Detention Center Policy an Invitation to Disaster
June 10, 2006
Human Rights First expressed sorrow at the suicide deaths of three detainees held at the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
"Loss of life under circumstances like this is a terrible thing," said Elisa Massimino, Washington Director of Human Rights First. "Beyond the individual tragedies, these deaths are the latest symptom of a chaotic U.S. detention system, which has proven a policy, legal and ethical failure across the board. Holding people indefinitely, without access to family, regular legal process, or independent medical care, is an invitation to disaster," Massimino added. 
Prior to these deaths, Guantanamo officials had stated that there were 41 suicide attempts by 25 detainees. Issues of detainee treatment at Guantanamo remain pressing. "That these deaths happened is an outcome no one wanted," said Massimino. "The only way to make tragedies like these less likely is to take seriously the humanity of those who are being detained by bringing these detentions back under the rule of law."
