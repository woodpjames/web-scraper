Women at the Forefront of Human Rights
March 01, 2012
Human Rights First celebrates inspiring women for Women’s History Month. Check out their stories. Eleanor Roosevelt was the driving force behind the International Declaration of Human Rights, which the United Nations passed in 1948. Since then, women have been at the forefront of human rights movements—pushing for human rights to be truly universal. Human Rights First is proud to work with courageous women from all over the world, and to commemorate Women’s History Month and International Women’s Day on March 8, we’re highlighting their inspiring stories. Some are women’s rights activists and others are human rights activists who happen to be women. Whether it’s promoting tolerance in Pakistan, democratizing Egypt and Bahrain, or fighting for LGBT rights in Russia, these women face unique challenges, from sexism to gender-based violence. Yet they refused to be silenced. We’ll be posting new stories daily. Check them out!
