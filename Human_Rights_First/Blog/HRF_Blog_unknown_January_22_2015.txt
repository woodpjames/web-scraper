Elisa Massimino to Speak at UNGA Panel on Antisemitism Today
January 22, 2015
 The United Nations General Assembly is convening a special meeting today to address concerns about the rise of antisemitism around the world. The meeting comes after 37 member nations, including the United States, urged U.N. President Same Kutesa to hold the gathering after an “alarming outbreak of antisemitism worldwide.” Human Rights First called attention to this resurgence of extremism and antisemitism in Europe in our report last fall: “We’re not Nazis, but… The Rise of Hate Parties in Hungary and Greece and Why America Should Care.” Recent events in France make the discussion even more pressing. Human Rights First President and CEO Elisa Massimino will be speaking at the panel beginning at 3pm. You can come back and check out the livestream here.
