Singer David Gray is not pleased that his music has been used to abuse detainees in American custody.  From the BBC:Gray's warning on 'torture' music    Singer David Gray has warned that US interrogators playing loud music as a form of "torture" - including his own song Babylon - was no laughing matter.                           "Only the novelty aspect of this story gets it noticed... Guantanamo greatest hits," he said.                           "What we're talking about here is people in a darkened room, physically inhibited by handcuffs, bags over their heads and music blaring at them."                          His track Babylon is reportedly a favourite of US interrogators in Iraq.                                                           Repeatedly playing loud music to suspected terrorist detainees is also a standard interrogation technique in Guantanamo and other US bases.                          "That is torture," the singer-songwriter told BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight.                                                   "That is nothing but torture.                                                  "It doesn't matter what the music is - it could be Tchaikovsky's finest or it could be Barney the Dinosaur.                                                            "It really doesn't matter, it's going to drive you completely nuts."                                                   He said such torture formed part of a US "retaliation to a few terrorist acts".                           "No-one wants to even think about it or discuss the fact that we've gone above and beyond all legal process and we're torturing people," he added.                          Babylon - from his White Ladder album - was Gray's breakthrough single, reaching number five in the UK in 2000.                                                   White Ladder reached number one in the UK and number 35 in the US.
