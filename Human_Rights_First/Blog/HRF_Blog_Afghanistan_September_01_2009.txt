Ratio of Contractors to Military in Afghanistan: an all-time high
September 01, 2009
A new Congressional Research Service report (pdf) confirms that ratio of private military contractors to uniformed miltary in Afghanistan marks an all-time high.The report was obtained by Secrecy News. As TPMmuckraker reports:As of March, there were over 68,000 contractors in Afghanistan and over 52,000military personnel... At 57% of total Defense Department workforce, the number of contractors represents "the highest recorded percentage of contractors used by DOD in any conflict in the history of the United States," the study concludes.This new dynamic reinforces the need for accountability. Human Rights First paves the way in our blueprint on how to end contractor impunity.
