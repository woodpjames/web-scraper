Twelve Errors (and Counting) in “Rebuttal”
September 09, 2015
Hitting bookstores today: Rebuttal, in which several former CIA officials defend their authorization of torture after 9/11 and criticize the findings of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence’s (SSCI) report. The book fails to acknowledge any of the mistakes the CIA itself admits it made after 9/11, attempts to justify behavior that can never be justified, and insists on looking backward instead of preventing abuse in the future. Senator Feinstein has pointed out that the book makes no new arguments and does not actually contradict the SSCI report’s fact-based conclusions: that the interrogation program was more brutal and widespread that the CIA had claimed, and that it didn’t produce intelligence not already obtained in humane ways. Also, a lot of it is just wrong. Claims about the SSCI report are overblown, and many statements are completely at odds with the CIA’s official response to the report. Here are 12 of the more glaring factual and logical errors and generally nonsensical statements in “Rebuttal”: Ultimately, though, the “torture was effective” argument is, like so much of “Rebuttal,” irrelevant: torture is illegal and contrary to American ideals. There is no excuse for the CIA’s use of torture.  Instead of trying to justify torture, it’s time to put into place measures—like the McCain-Feinstein anti-torture amendment—to ensure that it never happens again.
