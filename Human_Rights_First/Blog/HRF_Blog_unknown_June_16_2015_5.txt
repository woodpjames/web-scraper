Former Director of CIA Gen. Petraeus Supports Anti-Torture Legislation
June 16, 2015
This morning the Senate will vote on the historic McCain-Feinstein anti-torture legislation that would ensure that the use of torture or cruel treatment is never again the official policy of the United States. Gen. David Petraeus, former Director of the CIA has come out in support of this legislation, stating: “I strongly support the extension of the provisions of the U.S. Army Field Manual that currently govern the actions of the U.S. military to all U.S. government personnel and contractors.   Our Nation has paid a high price in recent decades for the information gained by the use of techniques beyond those in the field manual – and, in my view, that price far outweighed the value of the information gained through the use of techniques beyond those in the manual.” The bipartisan amendment was also supported by dozens of retired generals and admirals as well as intelligence and interrogation professionals. Voting on the amendment is expected to begin at 11:30am.
