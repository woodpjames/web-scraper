Judge, Military Leaders on Ghailani and Guantanamo
January 31, 2011
"This case was tried well, it was tried efficiently, it was tried properly," the  judge in the federal court trial of former Gitmo detainee Ahmed Ghailani said.  That’s also what HRF’s Daphne Eviatar said throughout the trial, which she  monitored closely and reported on our blog.

Last week,  Ghailani was sentenced to life in prison in a federal court in Manhattan.

Two retired generals published an op-ed in the Chicago Tribune today titled, “Where is President Obama's will to win? Close Guantanamo now.”

The fearmongers, however, are silent. Watch our video spoofing their reaction to the sentence. Hint:crickets.
Ask  your member of Congress why they are blocking these  trials.
