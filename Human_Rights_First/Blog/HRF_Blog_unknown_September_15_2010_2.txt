Report: Private Security Contractors at War
September 15, 2010
Ending the Culture of Impunity

This report examines patterns of private security contractor operations and the civilian casualties linked to them; the inadequate response of the U.S. government, principally the Department of Justice, to crimes committed by contractors; and the current legal framework governing private security contractors deployed abroad by the United States. 
The conclusion: the U.S. Justice Department needs to enforce laws in force and prosecute contractors suspected of violent crimes. The federal government needs to provide the necessary resources to prioritize these cases.
