“Facebook Girl” Shares Story with D.C. Students
April 06, 2011
Esraa Abdel Fattah. Repression may not be over in Egypt. Stand up for Egyptian activists at risk!Yesterday, Esraa Abdel Fattah, also known as “Facebook Girl,” met with McKinley High School students in Washington D.C. and shared her experience as a revolutionary figure in Egypt.

Esraa, who was imprisoned for her role in organizing the April 6th Facebook Protests in 2008, talked about the role of social media in promoting democratic reforms  and the path forward to protect freedom of speech and internet freedom.  The April 6th Facebook Protests saw the mobilization of thousands of young people demanding political change and fueled the youth movement behind the mass protests that brought down President Mubarak on February 11, 2011.

During the January 2011 nationwide protests in Egypt, Esraa was active on the Internet, on the ground in Tahrir Square, and in the media—including on Al Jazeera TV, regularly updating the world on the opposition.

Yesterday, students asked Esraa questions about women’s rights in the Middle East and the extent of Islamic extremism in Egypt. They were also very interested to learn how they could contribute to the democracy process in Egypt.

Human Rights First is hosting Esraa this week, and scheduling public and private events where she has addressed the democratic movements in Egypt right now and how U.S. policy can best support human rights throughout the democratic transition.
