Who's Enabling Syrian Atrocities? [Video]
April 20, 2012
Human Rights First has been working hard to disrupt the supply chain from Syria’s largest source of weaponry, Russian state arms dealer Rosoboronexport. We collected thousands of petition signatures and took to Twitter to urge the Department of Defense to cancel a U.S. contract with Rosoboronexport. We’ve also rallied a bipartisan group of 17 U.S. Senators to support this charge. Our message is clear: We will not stand for Rosoboronexport’s enabling of Syrian atrocities, and neither should our government.  Though we’ve made progress in our efforts to pressure Rosoboronexport to stop supplying weapons to Syria’s Assad regime, the body count continues to grow. More than 9,000 civilian deaths have been reported and many more are expected, despite the beginning of a partial ceasefire in the country. If the fragile ceasefire is to hold, arms flows into Syria must end immediately to make way for a political solution.
