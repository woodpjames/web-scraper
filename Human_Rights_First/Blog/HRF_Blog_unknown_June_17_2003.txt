Refugees Seeking Asylum Suffer Behind Bars:
Groundbreaking Medical Study Documents Harm Suffered by Detained Asylum Seekers
Take          Action! 

Human Rights First joins Physicians for Human Rights and the Bellevue/NYU          Program for Survivors of Torture in calling for thorough reform to the          U.S. asylum detention system

Refugees seeking asylum in the U.S. who are placed in jail-like detention          centers suffer physical and mental consequences, according to a report          released today by Physicians for Human Rights and the Bellevue/NYU Program          for Survivors of Torture. The report, “From Persecution to Prison:          The Health Consequences of Detention for Asylum Seekers,” presents          the findings of the first systematic study of the physical and mental          health of detained asylum seekers.

Read an          executive summary of the report.

“This is a truly groundbreaking report. It is the most comprehensive          medical report to be issued on the detention of asylum seekers, and confirms          what we have long known: detaining asylum seekers who have already survived          torture, rape, imprisonment, or other persecution is wrong and harmful,”          said Eleanor Acer, Director of the Asylum Program at Human Rights First.

Under a draconian immigration law passed in 1996 and policies which have          become ever more restrictive since September 11, 2001, asylum seekers          arriving in the U.S. are subject to an “expedited removal”          process in which they are automatically detained and rarely granted parole.          The mental and physical health of many detainees suffers during this period          of detention, which often lasts months if not years.

The report confirms:

In case after case, the government’s practice of imprisoning            asylum seekers inflicts further harm on an already traumatized population;
 Detained asylum seekers suffer extremely high levels of anxiety,            depression and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. 86% of the interviewed            asylum seekers suffered significant depression, 77% suffered anxiety            and 50% suffered from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder;
The already poor psychological health of asylum seekers worsens the            longer that they are detained;
 Asylum seekers suffer verbal abuse by immigration inspectors at U.S.            airports, as well as verbal abuse and other mistreatment at the hands            of officers staffing detention facilities.

Background:

In connection with the report, medical physicians experienced in working          with asylum seekers interviewed 70 asylum seekers who were detained in          detention facilities and jails in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania          – including the Wackenhut Detention Facility in Queens, New York          and the Elizabeth (CCA) Detention Facility in Elizabeth, New Jersey. Many          of the individuals who participated in the study are clients of legal          assistance organizations, including Human Rights First          and its volunteer pro bono lawyers.

The majority of the detained asylum seekers who were interviewed –          77% – came from African countries. The median length of detention          at the time the asylum seekers were interviewed was 4.7 months –          with periods of detention ranging from 1 month to 4 and ½ years          at the time of interview. For the 40 individuals who had been granted          asylum (4 received other forms of protection, 14 had been denied asylum          and 12 cases were still pending), the median length of detention was 7          months – with detention periods ranging from 2 months to 3 and ½          years.

Jean Pierre Kamwa, a torture survivor who was detained in the U.S. for          5 months before he was granted asylum with the help of Human Rights First,          now works as a counselor for refugees and asylum seekers. “These          detainees have, like I had when I arrived in the U.S., already been deeply          affected by what happened to them before they left their homes,”          Kamwa said. “Now they are in a windowless detention center with          no fresh air. They don’t know what will happen to them, if they          will be deported, or if they will be allowed to remain. They become more          and more depressed, sometimes they attempt suicide.”

While this study was conducted in the U.S., the report’s findings          are highly relevant to other countries that detain asylum seekers. U.S.          detention practices are particularly egregious, and are clearly in violation          of international law and the detention guidelines of the U.N. High Commissioner          for Refugees. The U.S. subjects arriving asylum seekers (in excess of          9000 last year) to mandatory detention, without giving them a chance to          have a court decide if they really need to be detained. (Human Rights First,          with the pro bono assistance of the law firm of Debevoise & Plimpton LLP,          has conducted a          comprehensive survey of the detention practices of countries around the          world.)

When an asylum seeker’s parole request is denied in the U.S., he          or she cannot appeal that decision to a court or even to an immigration          judge. “The INS – and now the new Department of Homeland Security          – is basically judge and jailor when it comes to deciding whether          an individual asylum seeker can be paroled from jail,” said Acer.          Even asylum seekers who meet the parole criteria are denied parole by          DHS. “This system, which was already so unfair, has become even          more so with the transfer from INS to the new Department of Homeland Security.”

Many asylum seekers now detained in the U.S. have family and friends          residing in the U.S. and present absolutely no danger to security. In          many cases, these are individuals who have been targeted for persecution          based on religious practice, or because they stood up for democracy and          human rights.

Recommendations and Action:

Human Rights First joins Physicians for Human Rights and the Bellevue/NYU          Program for Survivors of Torture in calling for thorough reform to the          U.S. asylum detention system. In particular, Human Rights First urges that the Department          of Homeland Security, the Administration and the U.S. Congress:

End the U.S. policy of mandatory detention without an individualized            assessment of the need for detention.
 Ensure that asylum seekers who meet fair parole criteria            and present no danger to the community are released from detention.
Provide judicial review by an immigration judge of decision            to deny parole for asylum seekers. 
Vigorously pursue alternatives to detention such as supervised            release programs. Implement and ensure adequate funding for            these alternatives, which have been demonstrated to be less costly than            detention.
 Create a high-level internal oversight mechanism within DHS            to ensure that asylum seekers and refugees are treated in accordance            with U.S. obligations under domestic and international law, and to ensure            that asylum seeker are provided with fair procedures for seeking parole. This need is even more crucial within DHS, because the bureaus within            DHS that detain asylum seekers at airports, borders, detention facilities            and jails – the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement            (BICE) and the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (BCBP) –            are now separated from the divisions with asylum expertise, which are            now housed within the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services            (BCIS).

We urge organizations that work with asylum seekers around the          U.S. to meet with local Department of Homeland Security officials and          their Congressional representatives to discuss this report, to raise any          concerns about the treatment of asylum seekers and to advocate for fair          parole policies and alternatives to detention for asylum seekers.
Take          Action! Urge the Department of Homeland Security to Stop Imprisoning Refugees          Seeking Asylum.
