Naomi Campbell and Mass Atrocities
July 30, 2010
Listen to Human Rights First's podcast on Naomi Campbell's upcoming appearance at Charles Taylor's war crimes trial in The Hague. Campbell is alleged to have accepted a blood diamond from Charles Taylor, who faces charges of crimes against humanity. This podcast starts with a look at how a supermodel ends up in an international tribunal, taking a deeper look underneath the blood-red carpet to discuss how mass atrocities happen and who enables them.
