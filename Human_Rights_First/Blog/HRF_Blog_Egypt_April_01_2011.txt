Human Rights First Hosts Egypt's "Facebook Girl"
April 01, 2011
Esraa Abdel Fattah. Repression may not be over in Egypt. Stand up for Egyptian activists at risk!

Human Rights First is scheduling public events and private meetings for "Facebook Girl" Esraa Abdel Fattah in Washington from April 1-7. She will give insight into the democratic movements in Egypt right now, including the role of Facebook and social media in the revolution, and a path forward to protect Internet freedom. She will also detail how U.S. policy can best support a strong human rights platform through the democratic transition. Read more about our work in Egypt.

Esraa is a leading Egyptian democracy and human rights activist. In April 2008 she was imprisoned for her role in organizing what became known as the April 6th Facebook Protests, a mobilization of thousands of young people demanding political change that gave its name to a branch of the youth movement behind the mass protests that brought down President Mubarak on February 11, 2011. Esraa is an activist and organizer who played a leading role in the mass protests in Tahrir Square. She is a prominent spokesperson for the youth protest movement in Egypt and on March 15 she was among a group of activists who met with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in Cairo. Esraa and her colleagues are known for their innovative use of social networking sites as an organizing tool. She is sometimes referred to in the press as “the Facebook Girl.” In 2011, Esraa was nominated as one of the 100 most powerful Arab women by Business Magazine.
