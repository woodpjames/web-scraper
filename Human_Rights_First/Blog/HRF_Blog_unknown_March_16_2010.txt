Renewing U.S. Commitment to Refugee Protection: The 30th Anniversary of the Refugee Act
March 16, 2010
Human Rights First gathered policymakers and experts in refugee and asylum law on March 16, 2010 for a full-day symposium at Georgetown University Law School in Washington, D.C.

The symposium highlighted the United States' achievements since the  passage of the Refugee Act of 1980, honored the contributions refugees  and their children have made to the diverse fabric of American society,  and evaluated the ways in which policymakers can work together to  overcome current challenges in the U.S. refugee resettlement and asylum  systems.
