President Obama's Record and Legacy on Human Rights: On the Radio with WBEZ Chicago
January 23, 2017
Last Thursday on WBEZ Chicago’s Worldview, Human Rights First President and CEO Elisa Massimino joined the program to discuss President Obama’s legacy on human rights. Broaching topics such as the ongoing world refugee crisis, the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, immigration detention, and anti-Muslim bigotry, Massimino analyzed the successes and failures of the last administration and provided a look at what comes next. While critical of President Obama’s leadership on Syrian refugees and treatment of asylum seekers at the U.S. Southern border, Massimino also praised the administration for its leadership on torture and efforts to close Guantanamo, which only has 41 remaining detainees.
