Cubans on Floating Truck Returned to Cuba by U.S.
U.S. Should Change Its Interdiction Practices
Take          Action Now!  

Pictures of the 1951 Chevy pickup truck converted into a make-shift boat          by 12 Cubans intent on reaching the United States have once again highlighted          the plight of those who attempt to reach the U.S. by sea. (Read          the Miami Herald Article and see accompanying photo.) So far this          year, 1186 Cubans and 1889 Haitians have been interdicted at sea by the          U.S. Coast Guard.

U.S. interdiction practices have been widely criticized by Cuban and          Haitian community-based and national advocacy organizations as well as          by church groups, human rights organizations and refugee advocates.

The Truck-Boat and the Crackdown in Cuba 

On Thursday July 24, the Miami Herald and other press reported that the          U.S. Coast Guard had intercepted a group of Cubans who had attempted to          reach the U.S. on a green 1951 Chevy flatbed truck that they had converted          into a boat by mounting it on a pontoon made of 55-gallon drums and attaching          a propeller to the truck’s drive shaft. The Cubans, who were interdicted          by the Coast Guard on July 16, were returned by the U.S. to Cuba. The          Coast Guard destroyed the boat which they described as a “hazard          to navigation.”

So far this year, the U.S. has interdicted 1186 Cubans. The increase          in the number of Cubans attempting to flee by sea to the U.S. coincides          with the sharp increase in political repression in Cuba. In the last weeks          of March 2003, the Cuban government sentenced nearly 80 human rights defenders,          independent journalists, economists and librarians to up to 28 years in          prison in the harshest crackdown on civil society seen on the island in          years. The government’s actions have been widely condemned by human          rights organizations, foreign governments and the United Nations. See          Human Rights First Press Release of April 9, 2003.

In fact, the White House on April 17, 2003, issued a press statement          stating they "remain gravely concerned about the fate of scores of          Cuban citizens who have been unfairly arrested, tried and sentenced for          the crimes of speaking their minds, holding discussions, and seeking an          alternative to 44 years of repression and fear." The White House          also called upon the United Nations High Commission on Human Rights to          deny Cuba a seat on the Commission next year because of Castro's "callous          disregard for due process and basic human rights."

U.S. Interdiction Practices and the Impact on Cuban and Haitian          Refugees 

Under the 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol, the U.S. is prohibited          from returning refugees to countries where they will face persecution.          Yet, despite this obligation, U.S. interdiction practices are woefully          deficient and fail to ensure that refugees are not returned to the hands          of their persecutors. Under U.S. procedures, migrants who are interdicted          on boats are not brought to the U.S. for asylum processing, are not given          access to lawyers and are not required to be individually screened to          make sure that they are not refugees who are in danger of persecution          if returned.

While Cuban migrants are read a statement in Spanish notifying them that          they may come forward and speak with a U.S. representative if they have          any concerns, this statement is deficient and encourages refugees to return          to Cuba to pursue in-country refugee processing. Haitian and other migrants          are not provided with any indication, written or oral, that they can express          their fears about being returned. Even if a Haitian asylum seeker should          voice a fear of persecution, the U.S. government does not require that          translators be present on every interdicted boat so their fears may never          be heard. Read          background information on the U.S.'s discriminatory treatment of Haitian          asylum seekers.

U.S. interdiction practices have been widely criticized. Human Rights First is conducting an extensive examination of U.S.          interdiction practices, with the pro bono assistance of the Yale University          Lowenstein Human Rights Clinic. The results of that examination will be          issued later this year.

Recommendations and Action: Urge U.S. to Change Interdiction Practices 

Human Rights First urges the U.S. to change its interdiction          practices. The U.S. should allow those who are interdicted to have access          to U.S. asylum procedures and to legal counsel. Those who are interdicted          should be individually and privately interviewed, with appropriate translation,          to ensure that they are not refugees who are in danger of persecution          if returned. Each person should be advised that he or she can request          asylum from the United States if they have a fear of return to their home          country.
