Letter: U.S. needs to be more critical of Egypt's diminished democracy
October 05, 2010
Human Rights First’s International Policy Advisor Neil Hicks published a letter to the Washington Post in response to an editorial on the upcoming elections in Egypt.

The Sept. 30 editorial "Beyond Mr. Mubarak"  was right to point out that advancing democracy in Egypt is in the  United States' interest and that pending elections are likely to be  anything but democratic. Political and social tensions are increasing in  Egypt, not least because of the government's uncertainty about how to  manage the succession process from octogenarian President Hosni Mubarak.  The denial of basic rights and freedoms to nonviolent government  critics and political opponents is widespread and persistent.

The U.S. government should be more willing than it has been to criticize  the Egyptian authorities in specific terms for violations that take  place. It should make the case forcefully to Egyptian leaders, in public  and private, that such practices harm Egypt's long-term interests in  development, social peace and prosperity for its people.

The U.S. government will lose nothing by calling things by their proper  names in Egypt, even if Egypt's leaders object. Failure to speak out  against human rights violations will be seen as complicity by many  people in Egypt and throughout the Arab world, which would risk further  tarnishing America's already battered reputation in the region.
