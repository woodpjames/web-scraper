Stop Congress' New McCarthy Witch Hunt
March 03, 2011
Write your reps today to fight the new McCarthyism
Congress is preparing McCarthyism 2.0.

Rep. Peter King, the Chairman of the House Homeland Security  Committee—the person in Congress who is in charge of our safety at home—plans to  hold hearings next week about the threat we face from our fellow Americans.

Write your Representatives  today to urge that facts, not fear, drive the upcoming hearings on the  "radicalization" of American Muslims.

Rep. King has said that 80% of religious leaders in mosques are  radicalized. Not true. He has said that American Muslims do not cooperate with  law enforcement. The police and FBI disagree.

What counter terrorism experts tell us is that alienating and  isolating communities makes us less secure.  Focusing on groups of people, not  on indicators of threats, makes us less safe. They tell us that radical clerics  tell the world that America is at war with Islam, and Rep. Peter King is playing  right into their hands.

General David Petraeus, U.S. Commander in Afghanistan, said that  vilifying American Muslims and burning Korans could "endanger troops and it  could endanger the overall effort here.... [I]n fact, images from such activity  could very well be used by extremists here and around the world."

We need to make sure that our national security experts  are not trumped by the politics of fear.

President Barak Obama said, "I've got Muslims who are fighting in  Afghanistan in the uniform of the United States Armed Services. They're out  there putting their lives on the line for us. And we've got to make sure that we  are crystal clear, for our sakes and their sakes, they are Americans and we  honor their service. And part of honoring their service is making sure that they  understand that we don't differentiate between them and us. It's just us."

Help us stand united.  Say no to the new McCarthyism. Write your representatives today.
