New Human Rights First Report Outlines Barriers Facing Refugee Women who Seek Asylum in the U.S.
Difficulties Facing These Women and Other Refugees                Will Likely Increase as Immigration Functions Are Transferred to                Homeland Security Department

Human Rights First just released a report documenting the harsh                and unfair treatment under U.S. law and practice that refugee women                face when they seek asylum here. The report, "Refugee                Women at Risk," tells the stories of 13 women who fled                forced marriage, rape, forced abortion, domestic violence, and other                gender-related violence and sought protection in the U.S., only                to be detained, deported summarily, or otherwise treated unfairly.

“Because of unfair U.S. immigration laws, refugee women who seek asylum                in the U.S. often face significant barriers in striving to win the                protection they deserve,” said Eleanor Acer, Director of the                Asylum Program at Human Rights First. “When                a woman with a gender-based asylum claim is barred from asylum because                of summary deportation procedures or an unrealistic filing deadline,                or when a woman fleeing from domestic violence is detained, and                forced to choose between a lengthy separation from her young child                and abandoning her claim for refuge, something is very wrong with                our laws and procedures.”

The challenges that these women and other refugees face have only                increased in the last year in the wake of government measures taken                in the aftermath of September 11. Many of these measures have deprived                non-citizens of due process. As a result, refugee women, already                among the most vulnerable of the already-vulnerable refugee population,                are at even greater risk of unfair detention, deportation or mistreatment.                Among these new government measures are the expansion of INS detention                authority, the gutting of the immigration appeals process, and the                transfer of the INS's immigration functions to the Department of                Homeland Security – a transfer that will occur in March 2003.

Barriers to Asylum

The United States has a long history of protecting refugees, yet                the ability of refugees to gain asylum was undermined in 1996 by                a new immigration law called the “Illegal Immigration Reform                and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996.” Some of the barriers                created by that law include:

A summary “expedited removal”                  process which gives INS inspectors at airports and borders –                  rather than trained immigration judges – the power to order                  the immediate deportation of a person who arrives in the U.S.                  without proper travel documents;
Mandatory detention” of asylum seekers                  who are subject to the expedited process; and
A filing deadline that bars most asylum claims                  not filed within one year of a refugee’s arrival.

One Woman’s Story

The experience of Beatrice Okum, a Sudanese Christian refugee,                illustrates the severe impact of these barriers on refugee women.                At age 15, Beatrice was forced into slavery for 14 years after fleeing                her home in Southern Sudan and being separated from her mother,                brothers and sisters. When she finally was able to escape slavery,                she came to the U.S. to seek asylum. Beatrice was handcuffed, shackled                and brought to a detention facility where she was jailed for nearly                five months.

Beatrice recalls her time in the Elizabeth Detention Center in                New Jersey, “watching daily the hopelessness, the ache, the                anguish on the faces of fellow inmates as they are filled with fear                and uncertainty, because we are subjected to a system where hope                often dies before it is realized.” Much of her time in detention                invoked flashbacks to her experiences in slavery. “I am only                fighting for freedom,” she said during her period of detention.                “I only want to be safe.”
