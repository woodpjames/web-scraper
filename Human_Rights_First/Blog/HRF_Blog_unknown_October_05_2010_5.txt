Times Square Bomber Gets Life
October 05, 2010
New York, NY â€“ U.S. District Court Judge Miriam Caderbaum  today sentenced Faisal Shahzad to life in prison for his May 2010  botched Times Square car bombing attempt. Human Rights First notes that  the sentence, mandatory under federal law, reflects the strength of  America's federal courts in handling tough terrorism cases.

"Shahzad's case took less than six months to come to conclusion and  he will serve the rest of his life in prison. There are more than 400  other terrorists who have also been convicted in our federal court  system. Shahzad's stiff penalty and the successful handling of these  federal terrorism cases stand in stark contrast to military commission  proceedings, which have only secured four convictions since 9/11,  including of two individuals who are already free," said Human Rights  First's C. Dixon Osburn. "The military commissions have given the  American people nothing but backlogged cases and endless legal  challenges. It's time to abandon them and stick with federal courts, a  venue we know works."

When Shazad was arrested in May, he was read Miranda rights. He  proceeded to cooperate with authorities and provided valuable  information to the FBI about his plot and others like it. His sentence  comes just one day before the federal terrorism trial of Ahmed Khalfan  Ghailani, a Tanzanian who's been in U.S. custody since 2004, will begin  in New York City. Ghailani is accused of assisting the 1998 bombings of  U.S. embassies in East Africa that killed 224 people and wounded  hundreds more.
