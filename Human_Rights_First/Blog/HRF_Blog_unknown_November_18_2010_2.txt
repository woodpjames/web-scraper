Human Rights First Urges CEDAW Ratification
November 18, 2010
Washington, D.C. – Today, in a letter to ranking members of  the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Human Rights and the Law, Human  Rights First urged ratification of the Convention for Elimination of All  Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). The group stated that it  favors the treaty because it promotes the proposition that women's  rights are human rights and its ratification would cement American  leadership in promoting gender equality and general anti-discrimination  efforts abroad.

"HRF recommends ratification of CEDAW so we can continue to move  forward to rectify what we all know to be awful truths: Women and girls  throughout the world often face particular kinds of gender-related  threats. Some suffer extreme abuse such as violence, trafficking, and  sexual slavery; others are excluded from the educational system or  denied the right to vote, simply  because they are female," wrote Human  Rights First's Tad Stahnke.
