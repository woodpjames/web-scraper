Closing Guantanamo Remains a Priority
January 06, 2010
Following the White House announcement regarding the suspension of detainee transfers from Guantanamo to Yemen, Human Rights First issued this statement urging that closing the detention facility should remain a priority - and is key to ensuring U.S. national security. We also have a petition running to urge that the detention facility is closed - sign here.In light of recent development, Human Rights First recommends:The Obama administration should press ahead in identifying third countrieswilling to accept the Yemeni detainees cleared for release and, at the same timecontinue to work closely with Yemeni officials to address current securityconcerns and to minimize potential risk before reinstating transfers there. Withall transfers the administration can and should take steps to mitigate risk byfocusing on expanding risk assessment efforts, monitoring, and other securityprograms, including allotting of sufficient resources to successfullyreintegrate former detainees.This Monday, January 11, marks the eighth anniversary of the first transfer to the Guantanamo detention facility.
