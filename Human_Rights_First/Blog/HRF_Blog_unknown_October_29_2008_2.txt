Torturing Democracy
October 29, 2008
If you live in New York, tune in to WNET on Thursday October 30 to catch “Torturing Democracy,” a documentary examining the Bush administration’s detention and interrogation policies. You can also view the documentary and a variety of supporting materials at http://torturingdemocracy.org/, and it will be shown on a variety of other public television stations nationwide in coming weeks. There has been some controversy around a decision by PBS not to air the documentary until January 21 – the day after a new President takes office. The film’s producer Sherry Jones has rejected that offer, and has been approaching stations individually in an effort to have the film aired before 2009. Stations serving some 85% of the nation’s viewers have scheduled an air date thus far.
