Four Things Obama Can Do Today to Help Close Guantanamo
April 22, 2015
On his second day in office, President Obama signed an executive order to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay within one year. Six years later, the prison is still open. National security leaders agree that Guantanamo harms America’s national security, and the president has repeatedly stated that he wants to close the prison. He has made progress towards that goal, but to get to the finish line, there are some things that President Obama and his administration can do today. If President Obama is actually committed to closing Guantanamo, he needs to make sure his administration is making it a priority. Though it was revealed today that the administration plans to release 10 detainees this summer, which would be good, it’s not enough. The tasks above could be accomplished if the administration redoubled its efforts and stopped passing the buck. While none of these steps would shutter the prison completely, they are essential steps to getting there, and ones the president can take right away.
