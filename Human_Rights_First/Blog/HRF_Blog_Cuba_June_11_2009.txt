Disappointing Cuba UPR Review Session at the UN Human Rights Council
June 11, 2009
On June 10, the UN Human Rights Council met  to adopt the UPR report on Cuba.  Human Rights First prepared a joint  statement (see initial statement below) to be delivered in conjunction  with other international NGOs calling attention to the precarious  situation of human rights activists in Cuba. We were unable to deliver  our statement as NGOs friendly to the Cuban government flooded the  speakers' list, and signed onto a joint Human Rights Watch statement  (see video) at the last minute.
