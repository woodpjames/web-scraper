National Review Sinks to New Lows in Defense of Torture
December 20, 2007
Just when you thought the National Review's editors had said all they could say in defense of the Bush Administration's pro-torture policies, they go and outdo themselves. Apparently unconcerned that the U.S. Constitution in fact created three equal branches of government, the editors warn against "undue interference from Congress and the courts" in the CIA tape destruction scandal.If there's one thing that has become clear from the ongoing revelations of torture stemming from Bush Administration policies, it's that we need more oversight of this Administration's counter-terrorism policies, not less.
