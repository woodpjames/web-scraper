WATCH: Elisa Massimino Details Roadmap to Close Guantanamo in Congressional Hearing
July 24, 2013
The Senate will debate the national security, financial, and human rights costs of Guantanamo on July 24 at 2pm EST at a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Human Rights. And you're invited. The Committee will hear testimony from some of the nation's top retired generals and admirals and Human Rights First President & CEO Elisa Massimino on the best way to move forward. RSVP here to attend the hearing and show your support for closing Guantanamo for good. Watch the livestream here starting at 2pm EST on July 24, 2013.  This year's Senate defense bill ends restrictions on transfers of detainees to the United States for prosecution, incarceration and medical treatment; it also removes obstacles to the repatriation or resettlement of detainees out of Guantanamo, including the 86 detainees who have already been cleared for transfer. Two months after President Obama reiterated his call to close Guantanamo, we're still waiting for the process of actually closing the prison to begin—including the first detainee transfers. Wednesday's hearing is all the more urgent with the ongoing hunger strike at the prison. Moreover, the end of combat operations in Afghanistan in 2014 will require a decision about what happens to the detainees who are being held under the laws of war. Senators John McCain (R-AZ) and Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) recently visited the prison with the White House Chief of Staff and reiterated that it must close. Human Rights First has monitored the military commissions system from their inception.

Date: July 24, 2013 Time: 2:00 p.m. Location: Room 216 of the Hart Senate Office Building.
