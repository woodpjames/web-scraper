In support of detention reform: interesting read in the Miami Herald
August 18, 2009
Great opinion piece in the Miami Herald this weekend by the vice chairs of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom on on detention of asylum seekers and recent legislation introduced in the Senate.Human Rights First spearheaded a campaign to thank the sponsors of the two bills, and to urge other Senators to support it. 

To learn more, read an earlier blogpost on USCIRF recommendations, or Human Rights First's report issued earlier this year on unjust detention of asylum seekers.
