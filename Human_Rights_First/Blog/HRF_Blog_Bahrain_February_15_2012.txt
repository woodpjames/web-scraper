Human Rights First’s Brian Dooley went on Al Jazeera’s Inside Storyyesterday and spoke about the ongoing crackdown by the Bahraini monarchy on pro-democracy protestors.
One year after the people of Bahrain took to the streets to demand democratic reforms, Dooley notes that the United States government is falling short in condemning the abuses committed by the Bahrain regime.
Pro-democracy protestors, who continue to be attacked, are looking to the United States to stand with them. But the Obama Administration’s silence on Bahrain—along with its recent decision to supply the monarchy with military equipment—simply sends the wrong message.

The facts are clear. The pro-democracy protests in Bahrain are among the Arab Spring’s largest uprisings. To retain its power, the government has responded with excessive force and international propaganda. The regime has detained more than 3,000 people since the protests began; many have been subjected to torture and abuse and have been denied lawyers and fair trials. The police responded to protests earlier this week with tear gas and sound bomb attacks.
The United States must stand with Bahraini democracy activists.
Tell Secretary Clinton that the time to act is now; condemn abuses in Bahrain and call for accountability.
