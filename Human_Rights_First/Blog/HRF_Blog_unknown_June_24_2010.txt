UN Day to Support Victims of Torture
June 24, 2010
Today is the UN International Day in Support of Victims of Torture, a solemn day when we should also remember the need for an accounting for abuses.Senator Leahy released a statement today referencing his continued support for a commission of inquiry into U.S. abuses. Human Rights First supports this commission to get at the truth of what happened, how we got there, and to come up with safeguards so we don't repeat the same mistakes.Human Rights First's President Elisa Massimino will be awarded tonight by the Center for Victims of Torture for our work with retired military leaders on torture--an award also earned by the terrific work of this group of principled leaders.
