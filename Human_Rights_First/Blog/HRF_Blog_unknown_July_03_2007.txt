In Rare Move, Supreme Court Reverses Self, Agrees to Hear Appeal of Guantanamo Detainees
July 03, 2007
On June 29, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to review the appeal of Guantanamo detainees on whether they have a right to challenge their detention in a U.S. court. This decision was a rare reversal of a previous order by the Court, which had decided in April against hearing the appeal. 

“The Supreme Court’s stunning reversal gives hope that the flawed policy that has denied detainees the fundamental right to challenge their imprisonment may finally be exposed for what it is: a sham and a shame,” said Maureen Byrnes, Executive Director of Human Rights First. “Restoring the right to habeas will put the United States on a path to repairing its reputation as a nation that prizes justice and aspires to leadership in the world.” The case will be set down for oral arguments in the Court’s October term.
