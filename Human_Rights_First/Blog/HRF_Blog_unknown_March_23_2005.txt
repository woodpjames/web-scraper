Proposed Law Will Hurt Refugees
U.S. Senate to Consider REAL ID Act Soon

The United States Senate is poised to              consider a bill that will put the lives of refugees at risk of              further persecution. The bill, known as the REAL ID Act,              will harm refugees fleeing torture, forced abortions, honor              killings, and other horrific violence. The bill will make it much              harder for refugees to prove that they qualify for asylum and remove              safeguards that protect refugees from being sent back into the hands              of their persecutors.

The leadership of the House of Representatives has attached the              REAL ID Act to an emergency spending bill in an attempt to              push the Senate to accept these anti-refugee provisions without a              meaningful chance for discussion or debate.

Please              contact your Senators and urge them to preserve our nation's              commitment to protecting refugees: Ask them to keep the REAL ID              Act out of the emergency spending bill.
The REAL ID Act

The REAL ID Act, if enacted into law, would undermine              this country's commitment to protecting those who flee from              political, religious and other kinds of persecution. The bill              would:

Make it much harder for refugees to prove that they qualify                for asylum; and
Prevent a U.S. federal court from stopping a refugee's                deportation to the country where she fears harm while the court                decides her case.

The bill not only expands an immigration judge's ability to deny              asylum based on minor inconsistencies, like a torture survivor's              failure to remember the date of his high school graduation; it also              allows an immigration judge to deny protection to a woman who was              raped by soldiers for her religious beliefs if she is unable to tell              an armed male airport inspector about the rape, but later tells the              judge.

One of the bill's most extreme provisions allows an asylum seeker              to be delivered back into the hands of her persecutors by barring a              U.S. federal court from issuing a "stay" to prevent her deportation              while her case is pending before the court.

The REAL ID Act was passed by the House of              Representatives as H.R. 418 on February 10, 2005.  Then, on              March 16, the House attached it to an emergency spending bill              relating to Iraq and to tsunami aid (H.R. 1268).

This move puts additional pressure on the Senate to accept the              REAL ID Act's anti-refugee provisions without sufficient              consideration or debate.

Please              contact your Senators and urge them to preserve our nation's              commitment to protecting refugees: Ask them to keep the REAL ID              Act out of the emergency spending bill.
What's Next?

The Senate is expected to take up this bill as early as the first              week of April.  It is extremely urgent that Senators hear              immediately from constituents who are concerned about these              anti-refugee provisions.

Human Rights First calls upon the Senate to remove the              anti-refugee language of the REAL ID Act from the emergency              spending bill.  Human Rights First, together with a diverse              group of faith-based, human rights, and refugee assistance              organizations, opposes this bill because it would harm refugees and              undermine this country's commitment to protecting those who flee              from persecution.
