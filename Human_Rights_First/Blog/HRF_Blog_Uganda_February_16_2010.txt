In addition to my dentist'sunwelcome inquiries, I've had my house set on fire, had several demands forinvasive body searches as a prerequisite for job interviews and churchmembership, and lost a job due to slanderous media coverage about my sexuality.My personal experiences speak to the harassment that affects LGBT Ugandans every day.The bill threatens to worsen persecution, sanctioning forms of discrimination against gays and LGBT individuals:The more controversial provisions of the Anti-Homosexuality Bill wouldsentence HIV-positive homosexuals to death for their sexual acts, make itillegal to publicly defend LGBT rights, or provide social and medical services to LGBT individuals, and turn Ugandan citizens into anti-homosexual informers.
