New Precedent Decision Portrays Haitians as Risks to National Security

The Attorney General issued a sweeping “precedent decision”                on April 17 which portrays Haitian asylum seekers arriving by sea                as threats to national security and effectively directs immigration                judges to indefinitely detain these Haitians.

"This is not a decision which is concerned so much with protecting                our security as it is concerned with sending a message to the Haitians                themselves," said Eleanor Acer, Director of the Asylum Program                at Human Rights First. "The thinly veiled message behind                this order reads: 'go home Haitians. You are not wanted here.'"

As a result of the Attorney General’s decision, Haitian men,                women and children – who have no intent to harm the United                States – will be detained in jails or other facilities for                months or years without being given a meaningful chance to demonstrate                that their detention is unnecessary.

“In essence the Attorney General – invoking the term                ' national security ' – is depriving asylum seekers of the                chance to prove that they, in their individual cases, present no                security risk and merit release on bond. Jailing asylum seekers                for months or longer and depriving them of the chance to show, in                their individual cases, that they present no risk and merit release,                is unfair and inconsistent with both American values and international                law,” added Acer.

This is yet another action taken by the Administration  which enforces                a discriminatory detention policy directed at Haitians,  Human Rights First said. The decision could also have a devastating  impact                on other asylum seekers and non-citizens given its overly  broad                invocation of "national security" to justify the  indefinite                detention of asylum seekers who mean no harm to the U.S.

In the decision (called In Re D-J-), the Attorney General refused                to release an 18-year-old Haitian asylum seeker who has been detained                since October 29, 2002, when he and about 200 other Haitian men,                women and children arrived by boat in Florida. The Attorney General's                action also vacated a decision made by the Board of Immigration                Appeals which had ruled that the young man was entitled to an individualized                determination of the need for his continued detention.

The Attorney General, in his decision, contends that releasing the                Haitian asylum seeker “or similarly situated undocumented                seagoing migrants, on bond would give rise to adverse consequences                for national security and sound immigration policy.” There                is no indication that the 18-year-old Haitian himself is any threat                to U.S. security. Instead, the Attorney General has concluded that                a surge in Haitian migration by sea would “divert valuable                Coast Guard and [Department of Defense] resources from counterterrorism                and homeland security responsibilities.” The Attorney General                also claimed that the State Department had asserted that it “has                noticed an increase in third country nations (Pakistanis, Palestinians,                etc.) using Haiti as a staging point for attempted migration to                the United States. This increases the national security interest                in curbing use of this migration route.”

A                full copy of the decision is available on the Department                of Justice’s website.

The Attorney General directed that immigration judges and the Board                of Immigration Appeals (the administrative appellate board that                reviews immigration judge decisions), in future bond release proceedings,                consider government submissions claiming that national security                interests are implicated. In so doing, the Attorney General sent                a clear signal that he expects immigration judges and the Board                to refuse to release Haitian asylum seekers as well as other non-citizens                based on U.S. government assertions of broad national security concerns                – even when there is no reason to believe the individual at                issue himself presents a risk of harm to the United States.

Human Rights First is troubled by the overly broad and contorted                arguments used by the Attorney General in order to justify his invocation                of the “national security” label in this case. “Attorney                General Ashcroft essentially says that giving Haitian refugees due                process is just too distracting,” said Acer. “And anything                distracting is by definition a danger to national security. Therefore                Haitian refugees are a threat to national security. And we're likely                to have less of them if we keep them all in jail.” Acer noted                that “this decision is yet another example of how the Administration                takes measures in the name of security that cause extreme hardship                to people without making Americans safer.”

At another point in the decision, the Attorney General also argued                that the 200 Haitian asylum seekers on the October 29 boat should                be detained rather than released on bond because the U.S. government                did not have the capacity to adequately screen them. The Attorney                General stated that: “Under the current National Emergency,                the Government’s capacity to promptly undertake an exhaustive                factual investigation concerning the individual status of hundreds                of undocumented aliens is sharply limited and strained to the limit.”                While it strains credulity to believe that the U.S., which is at                this very moment conducting security checks on many other non-citizens,                cannot handle screening 200 Haitian men, women and children, it                is also significant that nowhere does the Attorney General address                the substantial cost of detaining the Haitians for prolonged periods                – or the amount of money that could be better spent on directly                protecting national security if adequate resources were devoted                to promptly and thoroughly screening the Haitians, so that they                could be released from detention rather than jailed at substantial                government expense for months or years.

Human Rights First urges Attorney General Ashcroft to                revoke this decision and end discriminatory detention policies targeted                at Haitian Refugees.
