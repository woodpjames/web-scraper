Watch Cheney and Co. Respond to the Ghailani Sentence
January 27, 2011
In recent months we heard a lot of pundits wax hysterical  about the chaos and mayhem the federal court trial of a former Guantanamo  detainee would bring to New York. 

The folks at Keep America Safe – Liz Cheney,  Bill Kristol, and Debra Burlingame – called the trial  “dangerous,” “ reckless,” and “embarrassing”.  

But in New York the trial  proceeded with no disruptions. No street closures. No increased police  presence. And, this week, a federal judge sentenced Ahmed Ghailani to life in  jail with no chance of parole.

What’s the sound we’re hearing from the pro-Guantanamo  faction?  That’s right.  Crickets.

A fair trial led to a stiff sentence, leaving the  fear-mongers dumb.  The folks in the Obama Administration should keep that in  mind when they decide where to try KSM.
