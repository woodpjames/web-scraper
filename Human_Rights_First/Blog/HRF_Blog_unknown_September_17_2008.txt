Psychologists Take a Firm Stand Against Torture
September 17, 2008
APA members have voted in favor of a referendum stating that members may not work at detention sites beyond the reach of U.S. and international law.Be it resolved that psychologists may not work in settings where persons are held outside of, or in violation of, either International Law (e.g., the UN Convention Against Torture and the Geneva Conventions) or the US Constitution (where appropriate), unless they are working directly for the persons being detained or for an independent third party working to protect human rights.
