November 21, 2016
Today the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) voted to uphold the mandate of the Independent Expert on sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI). The UN Human Rights Council created the expert position in June of this year to investigate bias-motivated acts of violence and discrimination against the LGBT community, Vitit Muntarbhorn of Thailand assumed the role shortly thereafter. Human Rights First was one of 850 organizations from 157 countries that called for UN member-states to honor the mandate and respect the authority of the Human Rights Council.
