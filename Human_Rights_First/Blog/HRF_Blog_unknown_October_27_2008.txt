Al-Marri Amicus Cites HRF Report and Recognizes Usefulness of Federal Courts in Trying Terrorism Cases
October 27, 2008
On October 23, a group of former federal judges and  former senior Justice Department officials submitted an amicus brief in  the case of Al-Marri v. Pucciarelli.  The  brief asks the Supreme Court to reconsider a ruling by the Fourth  Circuit holding that the government has the power to arrest and imprison  suspected terrorists inside the United States – U.S. citizens included – and hold them indefinitely without criminal charge.

The  amicus calls the President’s actions an “unprecedented expansion of  Executive authority” that is “wholly unnecessary” since past cases prove  that federal courts are well-equipped to handle terrorism cases.  In  particular, the brief touts the success of the Classified Information  Procedures Act (CIPA) in protecting classified information in federal  prosecutions and supports its argument by citing a recent HRF report  entitled In Pursuit of Justice: Prosecuting Terrorism Cases in Federal Courts:  “Indeed, a recent study concludes that ‘CIPA has provided a flexible,  practical mechanism for problems posed by classified evidence,’ citing  at least eighteen terrorism cases where CIPA has been employed  successfully.”
