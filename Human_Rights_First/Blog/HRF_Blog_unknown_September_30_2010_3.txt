Ahmed Ghailani,  a former Guantánamo detainee, is charged with plotting with Al Qaeda in  the 1998 bombings of two American embassies in East Africa that killed  224 people. Not a nice guy.

Former Mayor Giuliani says these trials will make New York unsafe, even  though as Mayor he supported the federal court trial of the blind sheik  who bombed the World Trade Center. Karl Rove said, "we will see that  this was an utter unmitigated disaster for the security of the United  States."

Yet, our federal courts have convicted 400 terrorists since 9/11, while Guantánamo has convicted only 4. Politics based on fear rather then national security do not serve the public.

Here was the scene around the federal court house for the Ghailani  trial: The streets were not blocked off. There were no legions of  helicopters. Those who live and work near the court did not stay away.  The police didn't need an extra dime for added security. New York courts  and police have done the drill many times. It is just no big deal.

Help us spread the word about this trial, and the nonevent it turned out  to be. Watch our video and forward it to your networks! ...and if you  missed our previous Keep America Afraid videos, watch them too!
