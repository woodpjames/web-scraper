Statement by Maureen Byrnes, Executive Director of Human Rights First, Commending the Appointment of Jan Eliasson as Special Envoy to Sudan
December 19, 2006
"Mr. Eliasson's appointment is an important step on the road to a peaceful resolution of the Darfur crisis. It is welcome and we commend it. But to make this appointment a real turning point, the Special Envoy must use all his experience and stature to press the Sudanese government directly to fulfill its existing international obligations. He must persuade all parties to the crisis to engage in a meaningful and representative political process. He must also ensure that the U.S., the EU, China, Russia, and members of the Arab League are all effectively engaged in resolving the conflict. Finally, Mr. Eliasson will also have sanctions and other measures at his disposal, and he must stand ready to use them if Khartoumâ€™s intransigence continues."
