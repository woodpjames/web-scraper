Justice Kennedy Says Terrorism Cases Should Be Tried in Federal Courts
August 20, 2010
On Thursday,  Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy weighed  in publicly with a point that HRF has been making for a long time  now, saying that most terrorism cases  should be tried in civilian courts – not in the military  commissions now taking place at Guantanamo Bay.Addressing participants in the 9th Circuit  Judicial Conference in Maui, Hawaii, Justice Kennedy said that “Article III courts are  quite capable of trying these terrorist cases.” That conclusion agreed with the consensus reached  earlier in the week by a panel of conference participants.
