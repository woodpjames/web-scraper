Human Rights First Welcomes U.S. Membership on the U.N. Human Rights Council
May 12, 2009
New York  In a statement released today, Human Rights First praised the United States' decision to sit as a member of the United Nations Human Rights Council, noting the move is an important step forward in American efforts to serve as an international human rights leader.

"For too long, the United States has failed to play a constructive role at the United Nations Human Rights Council, standing aloof from the problems and controversies that have too often plagued its work. The Obama Administration's decision to join the Council marks a fresh start for the United States and will strengthen its ability to be a world leader in human rights," said Neil Hicks of Human Rights First. "Though imperfect, the Council is the United Nation's primary forum for addressing global human rights concerns. Today's election by the General Assembly provides the U.S. with a new opportunity to make the Council into an effective mechanism for the protection and promotion of human rights around the world."
