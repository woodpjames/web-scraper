During the last weekend of February 2004, President Jean  Bertrand Aristide left Haiti, and U.S. Marines reportedly arrived.    In response to the UN Security Council vote in favor of sending a  multinational interim force in to Haiti, French forces began to arrive  in Haiti today and Canada and Brazil are expected to be sending forces  as well.

Last week, President Bush said that the U.S. would "turn back any  refugee that attempts to reach our shore" from Haiti. Although U.S.  officials subsequently clarified that the U.S. would not return anyone  with credible concerns about persecution, the current practice for  identifying people who have such a fear is completely inadequate.

The U.S. Coast Guard confirmed that in the last week 881 Haitians have  been intercepted and returned to Haiti, including a group of 336  Haitians returned to Port-au-Prince on Saturday.  The U.S. has continued  returning those who flee Haiti by boat to Haiti despite the escalating  violence and uncertainty about safety and security.

In addition, given the deficiencies in US interdiction practices  (discussed below), the U.S. may very well be returning refugees to the  hands of their persecutors.

U.S. practices for interdicting refugees who flee by sea have been  widely criticized by Haitian community-based groups and national  advocacy organizations as well as by church groups, human rights  organizations and refugee advocates.

US Practices For Turning Back Haitians Endanger Lives

Under the 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol, the U.S. is          prohibited from returning refugees to countries where they will face persecution.          Yet, despite this obligation, U.S. practices for turning back those who          flee by sea are woefully deficient and fail to ensure that refugees are          not returned to the hands of their persecutors. Under U.S. procedures,          migrants who are interdicted on boats are not brought to the U.S. for          asylum processing, are not given access to lawyers and are not required          to be individually screened to make sure that they are not refugees who          are in danger of persecution if returned.

While Cuban migrants are read a statement in Spanish notifying them that          they may come forward and speak with a U.S. representative if they have          any concerns, this statement is deficient and encourages refugees to return          to Cuba to pursue in-country refugee processing. Haitian and other migrants          are not provided with any indication, written or oral, that they can express          their fears about being returned. Even if a Haitian asylum seeker should          voice a fear of persecution, the U.S. government does not require that          translators be present on every interdicted boat so their fears may never          be heard.

U.S. interdiction practices have been widely criticized as inadequate          to ensure that refugees are not returned to persecution in violation of          international law. Human Rights First has conducted an extensive examination          of U.S. interdiction practices, with the pro bono assistance of the Yale          University Lowenstein Human Rights Clinic. The results of that examination          will be issued later this year.

Recommendations and Action: Urge U.S. to Change Interdiction          Practices

Human Rights First urges the U.S. to change its policy of interdiction          and forced return of Haitians. No one fleeing Haiti should be returned          there while the situation is so dangerous that their safety cannot be          assured. The U.S. should not, under any circumstances, return people to          Haiti without first making sure that none on board are refugees who are          fleeing from persecution.

Those who are interdicted should be informed of their right to seek asylum          and should be individually and privately interviewed, with appropriate          translation, to ensure that they are not refugees who are in danger of          persecution if returned. Each person should be advised that he or she          can request asylum from the United States if they have a fear of return          to their home country. Interdicted Haitians should be brought to safety          - outside of Haiti - if not in the U.S., then in a safe third country          or other place where their safety and humane treatment can be ensured.
