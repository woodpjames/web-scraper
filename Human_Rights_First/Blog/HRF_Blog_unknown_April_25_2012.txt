Ride for Human Rights
April 25, 2012
By Jeffrey Heller I am a long-time volunteer attorney at Human Rights First.  Through them, I’ve helped hundreds of refugees win asylum in the United States. This April, I am embarking on my second Ride for Human Rights—a bicycle fundraising event in honor of Human Rights First’s work to defend refugees who reach the U.S., and to support human rights abroad. Human Rights First’s asylum work changes lives. Its network of pro bonoattorneys provides free legal help to refugees seeking asylum in the United States. Finding and training those lawyers is expensive.  Last year’s benefit ride from New York City to Postville, Iowa, and raised over $14,000. Along the way, I talked to school kids, retirees, farmers, whoever I met, to get them thinking about our legal and moral duty to refugees and about the benefits immigrants bring to the American heartland. This year, I’m hitting the road again. I’m biking south from New York City – a city that owes its wealth and culture to its millions of foreign-born residents—to Nashville, TN. A very generous Human Rights First board member has pledged to match all donations to the Ride for Human Rights – if we can raise $25,000! Please contribute today and help us reach this goal. Follow my on-the-road progress below and how we’re doing with contributions. Ride for Human Rights Progress Donors: 102
