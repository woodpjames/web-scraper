For many years we have focused onColombia as a country with particularly high levels of persecution againstdefenders. As the last witness today, I will briefly summarize some key themesthat have emerged in this hearing and present some recommendations forCongress.Today we have heard compelling evidence from a UN expert and twoColombian human rights activists about the reality on the ground in Colombia.(As an aside we are delighted that Gabriel Gonzalez is here today and thankyou Chairman McGovern for helping him obtain a visa to come the US.Human Rights First is honoring Gonzalez with its 2009 annual human rightsaward in recognition of his brave human rights advocacy and the harrowingbaseless prosecution he continues to suffer.)All speakers have voiced serious concerns about patterns of harassment againstColombian human rights activists. All speakers have described howColombian activists are subject to the full gamut of human rights violationsincluding killings, torture, threats, misuse of state intelligence, systematicstigmatization, unfounded criminal proceedings and impunity for violationsagainst defenders. Most shockingly as the Special Rapportuer concluded,activists are targeted “because of their legitimate work in upholding humanrights and fundamental freedoms.”Human Rights First welcomes the statement by Colombian President Uribe on17 September 2009 after his meeting with the Special Rapporteur that, "Thedefense of human rights is a necessary and legitimate action for democracy in acountry like Colombia which is proud to be completely open to internationalscrutiny in this field". We hope that this will signal an end to his dangerousstigmatization of human rights defenders as terrorists. We also welcome theconstructive relationship we have forged with various Colombian institutionsin particular to close baseless criminal charges against Colombian defenders.In February this year, HRF testified before this Commission and released a comprehensivereport documenting how trumped-up criminal charges are used to silence and stigmatizedefenders. Six months later, only one defender in the report remains imprisoned, CarmeloAgamez. Sadly, however, many more defenders have subsequently been unfairly detained inthose intervening months.As a source of approximately $500 million in annual aid to Colombia, the US can and mustplay a role in addressing the problems we have heard today. We have the followingrecommendations for Congress:US Congress should include in appropriations legislation a condition requiringcertification by the State department that Colombia is not violating the rights ofdefenders (a provision to this effect is in the draft Appropriations Bill and we urge thatit be retained in the final Act).The US Department of Justice should be a key ally for defenders in Colombia byensuring that its significant judicial reform aid is being used to defend those upholdingthe rule of law in Colombia. The US Congress should increase oversight of DOJ(through reporting requirements and budget hearings) to determine how DOJ is endingimpunity for violations against defenders, the misuse of state intelligence andunfounded criminal proceedings.As Gonzalez’s 4 months visa delay demonstrates, there is a desperate need forCongress to overhaul so-called “administrative processing” procedures so thatlegitimate human rights defenders can obtain visas in a reasonable amount of time.We also recommend that members of Congress encourage US foreign policy toColombia to adopt the detailed recommendations contained in the internationalcampaign for the right to defend human rights (copies of these recommendations areavailable at this hearing).Thank you.
