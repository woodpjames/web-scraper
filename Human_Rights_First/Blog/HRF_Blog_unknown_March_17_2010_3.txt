Thirty years after the signing of the landmark Refugee Act of 1980,  Senators introduced the Refugee Protection Act of 2010 (S. 3113),  legislation repairing many of the most severe problems in the U.S.  refugee and asylum systems. The introduction of the Refugee Protection  Act of 2010 coincides with the   commemoration of the 30th Anniversary  of the Refugee Act of 1980, the bipartisan bill that affirmed the U.S.  commitment to providing refuge to victims of religious, political,  ethnic and other forms of persecution.
