Human Rights First Statement on Khadr Ruling
June 04, 2007
"The dismissal of charges against Khadr is further evidence that this jury-rigged system is incapable of delivering justice," said Priti Patel, an associate attorney at Human Rights First, who is at the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, observing the military commissions. "The United States should seize on this opportunity to abandon the flawed military commissions system. If the United States has evidence that Khadr or any other detainee committed war crimes, it should prosecute them either in the tried and true military justice system or, where appropriate, the criminal justice system."
