HRF Applauds Release of Pakistan's Judges
March 24, 2008
Late last year Human Rights First Executive Director Maureen Byrnes traveled to Pakistan to get a firsthand view of events on the ground. She spoke with lawyers, judges and human rights activists about the need to restore the Constitution and to release those in prison and under house arrest. The following statement is her response to the release of the judges.

"We are delighted that one of Yousaf Raza Gillani's first acts as prime minister was to order the judges to be released from house arrest. 
Freeing the judges is just the first step in reversing the damage to Pakistan's courts and Constitution. Without truly independent courts, neither full respect for human rights nor long-term stability will be possible in Pakistan."
