Boston Globe: Release the Torture Memos
October 11, 2007
The editors of the Boston Globe today join the overwhelming chorus of Americans protesting the Bush Administration's new torture memos.  The paper calls on Congress to demand the release of the memos and an explanation from the Bush Administration -- if it can provide one -- of how the memos comply with the law.The Bush administration let Congress pass a law setting standards for interrogations that the administration had already decided - in secret - that it could ignore. Congress will deserve the low approval ratings it gets from the public if it lets itself be made a mockery of in this way.
