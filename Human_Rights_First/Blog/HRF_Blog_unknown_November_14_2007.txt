Would President Reagan condone torture?
November 14, 2007
Philip Giraldi, a former CIA counter-terrorism expert and current fellow at the American Conservative Defense Alliance says the answer to that question is a clear no.  In “Inside Track: Torture is Not a Republican Value” (National Interest online) Giraldi makes the case for why conservative Republicans should oppose torture. Reagan won the Cold War without torturing anyone.  Reagan would understand that torture dehumanizes and brutalizes the men and women who carry it out, the organization that orders it and the government that permits it.
