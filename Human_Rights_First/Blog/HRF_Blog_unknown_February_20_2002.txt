Refugee Resettlement Slowly Resumes

At House Hearings,                  Professor Argues Asylum-Seekers Need Not be Detained
Two Months After                  Program Resumes, Refugees Are Only Trickling In

The U.S. refugee resettlement program, shut                down after September 11, resumed on December 11 but it is still                only a faint shadow of what it has been for the last 25 years, when                the United States has accepted an annual average of about 90,000                refugees. During the first four months of this fiscal year, in which                the Bush Administration has committed to accepting 70,000 refugees,                only 2,790 actually arrived, according to the Refugee Data Center.                That is just 4 percent of the annual goal - although one-third of                the year has elapsed.

Thousands of people remain stranded abroad,                including about 20,000 who had been approved to come to the United                States before September 11. Part of the delay is caused by new security                measures. All refugees are subject to extra security checks before                they can travel, and they must now be fingerprinted upon arrival,                using new machines that are available at only four U.S. airports.                The fingerprinting has been taking so long that there is a limit                of 30 refugees per flight, to avoid long airport lines - further                restricting the number of people who can arrive each day.

Alarmed that U.S. refugee resettlement seems                to be eroding, refugee advocates have pointed out that with certain                efforts and planning, the United States could admit more refugees                without cutting corners on security. The decline in refugee admissions                this year, they say, is not only a consequence of September 11,                but also part of a long-time trend. Some U.S. officials in charge                of refugee resettlement have been dragging their feet for years,                according to refugee advocates, so that the United States has fallen                short of the refugee resettlement target set by the President each                year for more than a decade. In fiscal year 2000, for example, the                maximum was 90,000 refugees, but only 72,515 actually arrived. This                year the shortfall could be much higher. That would be tantamount                to sending lifeboats from a sinking ship with thousands of empty                seats, in the phrase of Merrill Smith, Washington representative                of the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service.

U.S. Officials Promise They Will Try                to Meet the Target of 70,000 Refugees 

In January, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State                P. Michael McKinley told a group of refugee organization officials                that he believed it would not be possible to resettle 70,000 refugees                this year, and that the Department would divert $38 million that                would have been used for resettlement. But on February 1, Immigration                and Naturalization Service Commissioner James Ziglar said that the                INS remained committed to bringing 70,000 refugees this year, and                Arthur "Gene" Dewey, the newly-appointed top State Department official                in charge of refugees, echoed Ziglar a few days later. The $38 million                was not diverted after all.

Senate holds hearing to Investigate                Slow Pace of Refugee Resettlement

On February 12, the U.S. Senate's Subcommittee                on Immigration heard Ziglar and Dewey repeat their pledges, when                both officials testified at a hearing entitled, "Empty Seats on                the Lifeboat: Are There Problems With the U.S. Refugee Program?"                Although he said refugee resettlement "resumed slowly, probably                too slowly" in December and January, INS Commissioner Ziglar said                he would make "an all-American college try" to reach the 70,000                target. He said INS will soon train 60 new people to go abroad and                interview refugees who seek resettlement. In September, INS recalled                all the officers who had traveled to conduct such interviews, for                security reasons. Without INS interviews, refugees cannot be approved                to come to the United States.

In his own testimony, Dewey said "it may take                a miracle" to bring 70,000 refugees this year, but he said the State                Department's Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration (PRM),                which he has just taken over, is committed to making the effort.                He promised Senator Edward Kennedy (D-MA), the subcommittee chairman,                and Senator Sam Brownback (R-KS), who attended and seemed to take                a keen interest, that he would "keep a running watch with you" on                refugee resettlement, and that there would be "total transparency."

A panel of refugee advocates testified next,                making blunt criticisms of the refugee program and specific suggestions                for improvement.

U.S. Committee for Refugees (USCR) director                Bill Frelick called for changes to the State Department's system,                in which refugees can only be accepted if they fit into certain                categories that are ranked in order of priority. Priority one or                P1 is meant to help refugees in acute need because of , for example,                medical trouble or imminent danger, but it has become a bloated                catchall category, Frelick said. He recommended that it be limited                to cases that are truly urgent. The second category, P2, is "refugee                groups of special concern to the United States."

"With more than 14 million refugees in the world                today, "Frelick said, "it is nothing short of scandalous" that the                United States recognizes only four such categories, and that all                of them have been on the list for more than a decade. The categories                of "special concern" all have Cold War origins, in other words.                The relevant countries are Cuba, the former Soviet Union, Vietnam,                and Iran. Frelick made many detailed recommendations, specifically                to protect refugee women-at-risk, to protect refugees who have been                persecuted because of their ties to the United States, to protect                disabled refugees and survivors of torture and violence, and to                promote family reunification among refugees.

Lenny Glickman, chairman of the Refugee Council                USA, a coalition of refugee resettlement agencies and other refugee                advocate groups including Human Rights First, bluntly criticized U.S. government                officials in charge of resettlement, especially at the State Department's                PRM. "I have never seen such an example of a government bureau failing                to meet both the President's commitment and the will of the American                people," he said. "With 14 million refugees in the world, why has                it been so difficult for the United States to find 70,000 to resettle?"                The answer, Glickman said, is that PRM has made the process long,                bureaucratic, and off-limits to most of the refugees in the world.                Even a P1 refugee in desperate straits must complete three lengthy                forms and undergo four interviews, so that the process tests for                "the survival of the most patient," he said. Like Frelick, Glickman                suggested that the priority categories be expanded, so that more                of the world's refugees can qualify.
