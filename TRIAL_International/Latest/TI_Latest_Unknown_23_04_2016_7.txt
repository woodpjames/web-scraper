facts

Marco Antonio Sanchez Samayoa served as a Colonel in the Guatemalan Army during the 36-year-long Guatemalan Civil War. During the early 1980s, the Guatemalan Army defeated a Marxist-led guerrilla movement, a move that included the killing of thousands of Mayan Indians as suspected insurgents. These military proceedings included a raid on the village of El Jute in the Chiquimula region, during which 8 persons were forcibly disappeared by the Guatemalan military. At the time, Colonel Sanchez Samayoa was the Commander of the Military Zone of Zacapa and oversaw counter-insurgency activities against suspected members of the guerrilla.
Remnants of various guerrilla groups that were defeated in the early 1980s later formed together as the unified Guatemalan National Revolutionary Union (URNG). The URNG continued its insurgency campaign until the passing of the 1996 National Reconciliation Law, which effectively ended the civil war while granting widespread immunity to the Guatemalan military for any alleged war crimes that took place during that period.
Sanchez Samayoa was taken into protective custody in 2005 for allegedly allowing for and overseeing the forced disappearance and illegal detention of 8 individuals during military proceedings in the El Jute village.
