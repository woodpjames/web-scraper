Reed Brody: “The greatest lesson from Habré’s trial is that justice is achievable”

An op-ed by Reed Brody 
Reed Brody fought at the side of Hissène Habré’s victims until Habré’s conviction and life sentence were upheld in April. Invited by TRIAL International, he recounted key features of the judicial saga. 
The 1998 arrest of Augusto Pinochet in London, was a turning point for international justice. It created a ripple effect, giving people hope to pursue their own tormenters. The idea that survivors could access international justice was new, powerful and exciting. I knew little about Hissène Habré when Chadian NGOs approached me in 1999 to take up their case. But the moment was right and the survivors had such a thirst for justice!
