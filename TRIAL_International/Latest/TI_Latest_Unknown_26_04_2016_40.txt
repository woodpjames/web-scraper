Russian national, Alexandre Kalaganski, was a lieutenant in the special unit of the Russian military intelligence services (the GRU).
On 11 January 2002, during an inspection at a road block between the villages of Chatoï and Daï, situated between Chechnya and Dagestan, Captain Edouard Oulman, who led the special unit of the Russian military intelligence services (GRU), ordered his men to open fire on a civilian vehicle with six passengers, after the driver refused to stop.
One of the passengers, Saïd Alaskhanov, head of a neighbouring village school, died instantly. Two others were injured.
Captain Oulman’s lower ranking men, Sergeant Vladimir Voïevodine and Lieutenant Alexandre Kalaganski, took the five survivors to a nearby abandoned farm.
Keeping them prisoners, the men treated the injured for the first time. Meanwhile, Captain Oulman radioed Major Alexeï Perelevski to report the incident, who then transmitted the information to the commander of the military unit. According to the prosecution, Major Alexeï Perelevski then radioed an urgent message from the commander to Captain Edouard Oulman ordering him to kill the civilian prisoners. Edouard Oulman passed this order onto his subordinates.
It is alleged that Oulman ordered his men to tell the five civilians that they were free to go, then to shoot them down as they began to move away. They carried out this order, killing the civilians, before putting their corpses into the car and setting fire to it. One managed to escape, but later died from their injuries.
Sergeant Vladimir Voïevodine, Lieutenant Alexandre Kalaganski and his two superiors, Captain Edouard Oulman and Commander Alexeï Perelevski were indicted following the events of 11 January 2002.
