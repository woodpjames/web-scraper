The US Navy Captain Ray E. Davis was the commander in chief of the United States Military Group at the American Embassy in Chile, in 1973, when the coup d’Etat resulted in the removal of the president Salvador Allende and the seizure of the power by Augusto Pinochet.
It is alleged that, in 1973, two Americans living in Chile – Charles Horman, a journalist, and Franck Teruggi, a student – were being monitored by US agents as part of a secret investigation carried out into the actions of Americans in Chile. Horman, 31, was a filmmaker and journalist and had settled in Chile in 1972. At the time of his arrest, he was researching a political murder and writing scripts for documentaries. Teruggi, 24, was a graduate of the California Institute of Technology and was studying in Chile. They were collaborating in a weekly news digest.
They were arrested in Santiago in early September 1973, transferred to the National Stadium, and executed without trial a few days after the 11 September coup. Neither of them was charged with any offense and both were identified as “subversives” on a list compiled by Chile’s military intelligence service. Their murders were later dramatised in the 1982 film Missing.
Captain Davis is charged with having provided information to his Chilean contacts which led to Horman’s death, as well as having failed to use those contacts to save Horman and Teruggi from their execution.
