facts 

Herbertus Bikker was born on 15 July 1915 in the Dutch town of Alblasserwaard. He joined the Waffen-SS (armed wing of the Nazi party’s protective squadron, the SS) during the German occupation of The Netherlands (1940-1945). Due to a decree issued by Adolf Hitler in May 1943, he obtained German citizenship by virtue of his membership in the Waffen-SS.
He worked with the regular police as prison guard at the correction and labor camp Erika near the town of Ommen in the Dutch province of Overijssel. He stood out for his remarkable cruelty against the prisoners, which led to his nickname “Butcher of Ommen”.
Herbertus Bikker and another man went to raid a farm in the district of Dalfsen, The Netherlands, on 17 November 1944. Their aim was to track down Dutch resistance fighters. Jan Houtman was hiding at that farm and when he tried to run off to escape, Bikker shot Houtman in the back, wounding him badly. Bikker then stepped up to Houtman, made a derogative remark and subsequently killed Houtman with another shot.
After World War II ended, Herbertus Bikker was put on trial.
