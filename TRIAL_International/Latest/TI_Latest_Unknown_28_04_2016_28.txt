facts

Alfons Götzfrid was born in Odessa, Ukraine, in 1919. He joined the German Armed Forces when they invaded Ukraine in 1941. At first he worked as a stableman, then as interpreter and finally he joined the security police in Lemberg (Lwow/Lwiw), Ukraine.
In 1943 he was assigned to the concentration camp Majdanek, situated in the outskirts of Lublin, Poland, to assist in the mass murder of Jews during “Operation Harvest Festival”. During this SS operation, up to 42’000 Jews from the Lublin District were killed over the course of two days, from 3 to 4 November 1943.
When World War II ended, he was captured by Soviet forces on 9 May 1945 and put on trial by the former Soviet Union in 1947. Götzfrid was sentenced to 20 years work camp in Siberia. He was released in 1958 and moved to Kazakhstan. In 1991 he moved to Germany where he obtained German citizenship under a program for “late repatriates” (Spätaussiedler) – people of German origin who had settled in areas of the former Soviet Union before 1945.
Götzfrid was called in for a witness hearing that was held in connection with unrelated Nazi war crimes in Dortmund, Germany, in April 1997. He unexpectedly admitted to having shot and killed 500 Jews in the Polish concentration camp Majdanek in 1943.
Alfons Götzfrid was arrested in Stuttgart, Germany, in March 1998.
