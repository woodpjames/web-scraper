General allegation to the Special Rapport on Violence Against Women
01.11.2014
In November 2014, TRIAL and 13 local associations working with women victims of rape or other forms of sexual violence during the war submitted a follow-up report to the Special Rapporteur to assess the level of implementation of her recommendations. Unfortunately, much remains to be done to fully guarantee access to justice and redress to women who were subjected to sexual violence during the war.
