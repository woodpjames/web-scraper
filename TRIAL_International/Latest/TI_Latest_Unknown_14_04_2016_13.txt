facts

Carlos Omar Herrero was born on 12 October 1925 in the town of Hinojo, in the province of Buenos Aires. He was a Lieutenant Colonel in the Argentine army and Police Chief in the province of Misiones from June to November 1976.
During the dictatorship (1976 – 1983), numerous clandestine detention centres were built around the country. Physical and psychological tortures, inhuman and degrading treatments were systematically used on detainees. They were confined in very small cell and received a very small amount of food. Three of these clandestine camps were known as « Casita de Mártires », « Casa de Rowing » and « Departamento de Infomationes ». All of them were run by the Police of Misiones.
Herrero, as Chief of Police in the province, is accused of having participated in organising some twenty clandestine detention centres in the province, including « Casita de Mártires », « Casa de Rowing » and « Departamento de Infomationes ».
Graciela Franzen, one of the victims, was kidnapped on 19 May 1976, tortured and raped for over two years. In 1984 Franzen filed a complaint before the Posadas’ court and an investigation was carried out. However no trial ever took place as the Due Obedience and “Punto Final” amnesty laws.
When the “Punto Final” law was repealed by the Constitutional Court in 2005, Herrero was no longer protected by amnesty laws.
