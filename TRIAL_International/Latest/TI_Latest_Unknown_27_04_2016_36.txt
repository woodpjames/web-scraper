Emilio Sandoval Poo was born in Lautaro, in the Southern part of Chile, on 23 April 1935.
During the years of Pinochet’s regime, Sandoval Poo was a well-known businessman in Temuco, important town in Southern Chile, and a reservist official with the rank of captain in the FACH (Chilean Air Force) in the air base of Maquehua, close to Temuco.
On 18 September 1973, around a week after the coup d’etat by Pinochet, Etienne Pesle, a former catholic priest of French nationality, was arrested in Temuco by a Chilean Air Force patrol. He was a member of the Chilean Socialist Party and of the Christian Movement for Socialism. Moreover, the new military establishment frowned upon the Institute of Agricultural Development (INDAP), for which Pesle used to work. The Institute indeed had the task to deliver technical assistance to the cooperatives created after the expropriations carried out under the Agrarian Reform to the detriment of the big landowners.
The arrest was carried out by a squad of four men dressed in FACH uniforms, including Emilio Sandoval Poo. According to the charges, Sandoval Poo first denounced Pesle to the military, then led the rest of the squad to the INDAP office, where the arrest took place. Being at the time quite famous in Temuco, Sandoval Poo was recognized by many witnesses as the driver of the white van which took Pesle away.
Pesle was not seen anymore. Witnesses affirmed that he was detained in the Maquehua air base, where he was tortured.
Following the arrest of Augusto Pinochet on 16 October 1998 in London, between October and November 1998 some Franco-Chilean families of victims of the Pinochet’s dictatorship – including the family of Etienne Pesle – filed complaints in France.
