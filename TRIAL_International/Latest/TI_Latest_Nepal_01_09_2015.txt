Nepal: Alternative report for the Universal Periodic Review 2015
01.09.2015
On 25 January 2011, the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (WG-UPR) reviewed Nepal. As a result, on 8 March 2011, the report of the WG-UPR was published, containing a number of recommendations to Nepal.
On 4 November 2015, Nepal will be subjected to a second review. In anticipation thereof, TRIAL submitted this report in March 2015, providing information to the WG-UPR on the state of implementation of a selected number of recommendations issued in 2011.
In September 2015, TRIAL issued this statement,Â emphasising the continued lack of implementation of the aforementioned recommendations. The statement draws particular attention to shortcomings relating to the codification of crimes under domestic law (both in relation to torture and enforced disappearance), the ratification of relevant international instruments, the failure to investigate and prosecute those responsible for gross violations of human rights, as well as other flaws of the newly established transitional justice mechanisms. For each particular issue addressed, the statement includes a number of concrete questions that TRIAL would encourage States to pose to the representatives of Nepal during its second cycle review, as well as proposed recommendations that it urges States present to make during the review.
