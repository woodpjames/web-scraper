facts 

Milivoje Ćirković was born on 3 November 1973 in Bratunac. He was a member of the Jahorina Training Centre of the Special Police Brigade (SBP) of the Republika Srpska’s Ministry of Interior (RS MUP).
The Training Centre at Jahorina, in the south-east of Bosnia and Herzegovina, was formed with the aim of training conscripts who had completed military service in the RS MUP. Training was carried out by instructors from the SBP and the MUP. In June 1995, in Serbia, police rounded up Bosnian citizens and sent them to the Centre. After training, they were sent onto the terrain around the besieged Bosniak enclave of Srebrenica.
Civilians from Srebrenica fled to the Dutch UN battalion headquarters at Potocari after the town centre fell to the VRS, led by Ratko Mladic. The members of the Jahorina Training Centre participated in coordinating the transportation of women and children to the Bosnian government-held town of Tuzla, as well as in the separation from them of all militarily capable men on July 12 and 13.
Members of the Training Centre captured the men who surrendered in the forests, having fled from Srebrenica towards Tuzla. The Members held them on the meadow in Sandici, and then took them to a warehouse in Kravica.
On 13 July, ten wounded men were killed in Sandici. Dragan Crnogorac, member of the Training Centre, pleaded guilty of involvement in this murder, and was sentenced in May 2011 to 13 years’ prison. Milivoje Cirkovic and Zoran Kusic, his colleagues from the platoon, also confessed to having killed one detainee.
According to the verdict handed down by the ICTY, about 100 to 150 men left the warehouse and then were executed by members of the Training Centre.
In September 2010, the Prosecutor’s Office of BiH has filed an indictment against Milivoje Ćirković for crimes against humanity under the Article 172 of the BiH Criminal Code.
