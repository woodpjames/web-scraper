Between discrimination and empowerment: testimony of a human rights defender in DRC
10.10.2018
What does it mean to be a woman in the Democratic Republic of Congo? What does everyday life of a human rights defender look like? Our colleague Ghislaine Bisimwa recounts her situation in Bukavu, the capital of South Kivu. 
The context in Eastern DRC is tense in this pre-electoral period. These tensions are compounded by structural difficulties: for a large part of the population, access to food, health, education or even drinking water and electricity is difficult.
In the most remote areas of Bukavu, insecurity is at its height â€“ and women and girls are the first victims. They are exposed to rape, for example when they go and collect water at nightfall.
