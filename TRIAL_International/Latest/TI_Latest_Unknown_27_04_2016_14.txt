facts

Pierre Célestin Halindintwali was born in 1965 in the city of Kibaye, prefecture of Butare in Rwanda. Before and during the genocide, Halindintwali held the position of Director of public works in the Ministry of public services (Minitrap). It would be through his cousin, the former prefect of Butare Alphonse Nteziryayo, convicted by the ICTR for his role in the genocide, that Halindintwali would have become acquainted with the “Coalition for the defense of the Republic” (CDR), a Hutu extremist party.
During the genocide, Halindintwali has allegedly used the means at his disposal as Director of public works to help the Impuzamugambi militia, under the control of the CDR. He would have provided means of transportation and gasoline to these militias. He also would have been seen supervising the digging of graves for the concealment of bodies in Butare during the genocide. Witnesses also referred to his presence at roadblocks held by Hutu militia.
Halindintwali has left in exile in Kivu in 1995 and is now believed to be in Canada, where he was seen in 2007. His name appears on the list of people suspected of having committed crimes of genocide in Rwanda and living abroad, issued in 2006 by the Prosecutor general in Rwanda.
An arrest warrant for Halindintwali has been issued by Rwanda for crime of genocide. According to the Rwandan government, an extradition request has been sent to Canada in 2007, without response for the time being.
