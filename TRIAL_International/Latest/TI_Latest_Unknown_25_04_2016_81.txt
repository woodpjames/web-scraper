facts

Vladimir Voievodine, a Russian citizen, was a Sergeant in the Russian army and a member of a special unit of the military intelligence service known as the GRU.
On 11 January 2002, during an inspection at a checkpoint between the villages of Dai and Shatoy (located between Chechnya and Dagestan), the Commander of the GRU named Captain Edouard Oulman ordered his men to open fire on a civilian vehicle with six passengers after the driver refused to stop.
Saïd Alaskhanov, one of the passengers who was also the Head of a school in a neighbouring village, died on the spot. Two of the other six passengers were wounded.
Captain Oulman’s subordinates, Sergeant Vladimir Voïevodine and Lieutenant Alexander Kalaganski, took the five survivors to an abandoned farm nearby.
They then administered first aid to the wounded, keeping them prisoners while Captain Oulman informed Major Alexeï Perelevski of the incident by radio. Major Alexeï Perelevski then passed on the information to the commandment of the military unit. According to the prosecution, Major Alexei Perelevskii then sent via Captain Edouard Oulman a radio message from the commandment ordering him to assassinate the detained civilians. He then passed on this order to his subordinates.
It is alleged that Oulman ordered his subordinates to tell the five civilians that they were free to leave and then shoot them when they tried to do so. His subordinates carried out this order, killing the civilians before placing their bodies in the car and setting it on fire.
One of the victims managed to escape but died later from his injuries.
Sergeant Vladimir Voïevodine and his two superiors, Captain Edouard Oulman and Commander Alexeï Perelevski, and Lieutenant Alexander Kalaganski were indicted following the events of 11 January 2002.
