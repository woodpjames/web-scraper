Facts

Reinhold Hanning was born on 28 December 1921 in Helpup, Germany. He grew up in Lippe where he attended elementary school. He then worked in a bicycle factory.
Hanning joined the Hitler Youth at the age of 14, and subsequently the Waffen SS, the armed wing of the SS in 1940, at the age of 18. He was sent to the concentration camp in Auschwitz in January 1942, after having been wounded in battle and having been declared unfit for war. In June 1944, he was transferred to Sachsenhausen concentration camp. Hanning became a prisoner of war in May 1945, and was released on 20 May 1948.
Hanning was accused of serving as a guard at Auschwitz from January 1943 to June 1944. As an Unterscharführer (junior squad leader), Hanning was allegedly responsible for guarding transports of people entering the camp in Nazi-occupied Poland.
Hanning was allegedly present at the death camp during what became known as the “Hungary Operation”, the period from May to June 1944 when over 430,000 Hungarian Jews were deported to Auschwitz and over 300,000 were gassed on arrival. The operation consisted of separating those able to work from the others (mainly elderly, sick, pregnant women and children), and sending the latter immediately to the gas chambers to be killed.
According to his indictment, Hanning, in his function of guard, was aware of the commission of the mass shootings taking place on a regular basis in the camp, and allegedly aided in the prisoner selection process.
