Facts

Ratko Romić was the chief intelligence inspector of the 6th Department of State Security (DB), the intelligence service of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
In this capacity, Romić allegedly participated in the murder of Serbian journalist Slavko Ćuruvija on 11 April 1999. The victim was shot in the back 17 times in front of his residence in Belgrade. According to his family and colleagues, Ćuruvija’s killing was motivated by his opposition against the regime of then-Serbian President Slobodan Milošević. Ćuruvija had been designated an enemy of the state due to his public criticism of Milošević and was systematically monitored by state security from 1996.
On 3 October 1999, the procession of former Deputy Prime Minister of the FRY, Vuk Drašković, was struck by a lorry filled with sand while circulating on the Ibar highway. Romić was suspected of being involved in the planning of the attack, in which four of Drašković’s aides were killed.
Romić and his former SDB colleagues Milan Radonjić and Stevan Basta were arrested and charged with helping to plan the assassination attempt on Drašković in 1999.
