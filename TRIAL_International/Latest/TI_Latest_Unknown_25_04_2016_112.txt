facts

Dragan Zivanovic was a colonel in the 125th motorized division during the international armed conflict in Kosovo from 24 March 1999 to 20 June 1999.
He is suspected of failing to uphold his duty to take all necessary and reasonable measures within his power to prevent war crimes against Albanian civilians in the Kosovo villages of Cuska, Pavijan, Ljubenic and Zahac between 1 April 1999 and 15 May 1999.
A truly horrendous campaign was undertaken during this period. The crimes were as follows: the murder of at least 118 people and serious injuries to 13 others, the destruction of 40 houses, looting of houses, forced evictions and the seizure and destruction of the inhabitants’ personal documents.
According to allegations made by the Serbian War Crimes Prosecutor, Zivanovic had ordered members of the 177th intervention squad of the former Yugoslav army in Pec to undertake a “search and cleansing” operation in the villages of Cuska, Pavijan, Ljubenic and Zahac. He therefore knew that these men had launched a large-scale attack against Albanian civilians in these villages, including murder and serious injury, as well as forced relocation and destruction of their belongings.
On 5 August 2014, the Serbian War Crimes Prosecutor began an investigation into Zivanovic. He is the first general suspected under Serbian law for being responsible, in his superior role, of war crimes committed by his subordinates during the international armed conflict in Kosovo.
