facts

Laurent Gbagbo was born on 31 May 1945 near Gagnoa. He has a doctorate from a Paris university, he became a strident opponent of Côte d’Ivoire’s founding president Felix Houphouet-Boigny.
Between 1971 and 1973 and again in 1992 he was jailed for political agitation. In 1982 he formed the opposition Ivorian Popular Front (FPI) and demanded a shift toward multi-party elections. He went into exile in France later the same year, returning in 1988 to step up the pressure for democratic reform. In 1990, Gbagbo and the FPI succeeded in pushing Mr Houphouet-Boigny toward Côte d’Ivoire’s first national elections since its independence.
Gbagbo was President of the FPI Parliamentary Group from 1990 to 1995 and became the country’s president in 2000.
Gbagbo’s original presidential mandate was supposed to expire on 30 October 2005, but he refused to hold new elections. Presidential elections were postponed six times until Gbagbo eventually agreed to hold them in 2010.
However, following the 2010 presidential election, Gbagbo challenged the vote count, alleged fraud, and refused to stand down. Alassane Ouattara was declared the winner with 54.1% of the vote and was recognized as such by election observers, the international community, the African Union (AU), and the Economic Community of West African States.
Due to Gbagbo’s refusal to cede power, tensions mounted in the country. Gbagbo allegedly responded by launching ethnic attacks on northerners living in Abidjan. He allegedly ordered the army to close the borders and foreign news organizations were banned from broadcasting from within the country.
On 30 March 2011 the Security Council imposed targeted sanctions against Laurent Gbagbo and his close associates and in its resolution 1975 firmly condemned the violence and other violations and abuses of human rights, in particular enforced disappearances, extrajudicial killings, killing and maiming of children and rapes and other forms of sexual violence, noting that the International Criminal Court might decide on its jurisdiction over the situation. The United Nations Human rights Council has also appointed a team of human rights experts as members of the Commission of Inquiry to investigate the allegations of serious abuses and violations of human rights committed in Côte d’Ivoire following the presidential elections of 28 November 2010.
