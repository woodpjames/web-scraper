Facts

Yim Tith was born in the Tram Kâk district of Takeo province in Cambodia. He is married to Ung Ken, the sister of the accused Ta Mok.
Buddhist monk in Takeo and Phnom Penh at first, Tith then became a member of the Cambodian Communist Party in the 1960s. During the 1970-1975 civil war, Tith became a high profile leader of the Kirivong district.
In 1976, Tith allegedly became party secretary of the Kirivong district. Reportedly, he exercised effective control over the individuals, security centres and other crime sites in the area. At the Kraing Ta Chan security centre, it is estimated that almost 15’000 individuals – so-called enemies of the regime and its ideology- were imprisoned, tortured and killed under his authority.
In 1977 and 1978, Tith and Mok are suspected to have planned and initiated a massive purge against the Northwest Zone cadres. Tith allegedly assumed the positions of leader of the Northwest Zone, Secretary of Sector 1 of the Northwest Zone and Deputy Secretary of the Northwest Zone Committee. Upon his arrival, it is believed that the number of arrests, killings and disappearances dramatically increased. He also supposedly became a member of the Communist Party of Kampuchea Central Committee at the 5th Party Congress.
