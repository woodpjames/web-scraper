facts 

Simo Zaric was born on 25 July 1948 in Trnjak in the Municipality of Odzak. At the time the events occurred, he held several positions related to intelligence gathering and security in the Bosanski Samac region. In particular, he was responsible for the interrogation of prisoners.
He was indicted by the Prosecutor of the ICTY for planning, instigating and ordering , in collaboration with other political leaders, a campaign of persecutions whose aim it was to get rid of all the non-Serbian inhabitants of the Municipalities of Bosanski Samac and Odzak.
The Serbian authorities in so doing arrested and imprisoned a large number of individuals and also forced many civilians to leave their homes. They also disseminated rules and regulations which discriminated against the non-Serbs, insisted that the great majority of them be put into forced labour and undertook a large scale appropriation of their personal and commercial property.
In carrying out this plan, led Simo Zaric reportedly committed serious violations of international humanitarian law. Most notably he participated in acts of torture.
This campaign lasted approximately from 1 September to 31 December 1993. The accused took an active part in it for a period of around three months.
Before 17 April 1992, the Municipality of Bosanski Samac was made up of close to 17’000 Muslims and Croatians living in Bosnia against an overall population of around 33’000. In May 1995, there remained less than 300.
Simo Zaric gave himself up voluntarily on 24 February 1998 and was transferred on the following day to the ICTY (International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia).
