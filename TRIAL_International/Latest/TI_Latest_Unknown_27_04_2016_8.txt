facts

Lucas Tecú was born in Guatemala between 1955 and 1956. At the beginning of the 1980s, in the framework of the internal armed conflict in Guatemala, Tecú held the office of Military Commissioner in the town of Rabinal, in the Department of Baja Verapaz. Later on he was elected deputy mayor of the town, running for the Guatemalan Republican Front (FRG, Frente revolucionario Guatemalteco) led by former dictator Efraín Ríos Montt.
In 1982 General Rios Montt endorsed the creation of paramilitary groups known as PAC (Patrullas de Autodefensa Civil) aimed at maintaining control over rural areas of Guatemala. The town of Rabinal and surrounding villages were frequently visited by the army and by paramilitary groups in order to search for insurgents and their supporters.
On 18 July 1982 the Maya hamlet of Plan de Sanchez, close to Rabinal, was surrounded by around 60 men in uniforms, allegedly members of the armed forces and of the PAC programme. On that day the village was full of people coming from other local communities, arrived there on occasion of the weekly market day.
Once entered in the village, girls and women were spared from the rest of the people, raped, tortured and eventually killed. The rest of the villagers were forced into a house, which was then targeted with grenades. Finally the perpetrators set the house on fire with gasoline. The massacre resulted in 256 casualties, including women and children. Lucas Tecú allegedly took an important part in planning the operations.
In 1992 ten survivors of the ‘Plan de Sanchez’ massacre lodged a complaint in Guatemala for the damages suffered in the event. After that evidence of the massacre was found in some mass graves in the region, in 1996 the Human Rights Ombudsman’s Office in Guatemala released a report indicating the responsibility of State agents for the events in Plan de Sanchez.
