On 3 January 2007 Nepal ratified the  Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of Children in Armed Conflict (OPAC). On 15 October 2012 Nepal presented to the Committee on the Rights of the Child its Initial Report (CRC/C/OPAC/NPL/1) pursuant to Article 8, para. 1, of the OPAC.
On 26 June 2014 TRIAL submitted an alternative report to the Committee containing information regarding the implementation of the OPAC by Nepal. In particular, the report focused on the obligations contained in Articles 1, 2, 4 and 6 of the OPAC concerning the prohibition and prosecution of crimes related to the involvement of children in armed conflicts. An executive summary is available.
On 20 October 2014, the Committee issued its “List of issues in relation to the report submitted by Nepal under article 8, paragraph 2, of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict” (CRC/C/OPAC/NPL/Q/1), whereby Nepal was requested to submit its written responses by 15 March 2015.
Between the submission of the June 2014 report and the scheduled date of the interactive dialogue, 22 May 2015, several events took place in Nepal. TRIAL updated the Committee on these developments through an update report submitted on April 2015.
Following the earthquake in April 2015, the review of Nepal by the CRC was postponed to May 2016. In this context, TRIAL submitted a second update report to provide the Committee with complementary information.
