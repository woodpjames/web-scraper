Facts

Milan Radonjić was the director of the Belgrade office of the State Security Service (SDB), the intelligence service of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
In this capacity, Radonjić allegedly participated in the murder of Serbian journalist Slavko Ćuruvija on 11 April 1999. The victim was shot in the back 17 times in front of his residence in Belgrade. According to his family and colleagues, Ćuruvija’s killing was motivated by his opposition against the regime of then-Serbian President Slobodan Milošević. Ćuruvija had been designated an enemy of the state due to his public criticism of Milošević and was systematically monitored by state security from 1996.
On 3 October 1999, the procession of former Deputy Prime Minister of the FRY, Vuk Drašković, was struck by a lorry filled with sand while circulating on the Ibar highway. Radonjić was suspected of being involved in the planning of the attack, in which four of Drašković’s aides were killed.
Radonjić and his former SDB colleagues Ratko Romic and Stevan Basta were arrested and charged with helping to plan the assassination attempt on Drašković in 1999.
