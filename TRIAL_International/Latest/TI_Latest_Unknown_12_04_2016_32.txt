facts 

Fuat Karaosmanoglu was the Director of the Metris prison located in Istanbul (Turkey). In 2008, he was involved along with other officials in acts of torture leading to the death of Engin Ceber.
Engin Ceber was a Turkish journalist and human rights activist who was 29 years old when he died. He had been arrested with three others on 28 September 2008 in the district of Sariyer in Istanbul, during a protest in support of Ferhat Gerçek, a human rights activist who was killed a year earlier by police gunfire. He was then taken into custody at the Istinye Police station for allegedly having distributed the magazine “Yürüyüs” at a press conference.
Whilst in police custody, he was tortured together with three others, namely Özgur Karakaya, Cihan Gün and Aysu Baykal. They were beaten by a metal rod, a wooden club, a metal pitcher and a chair, and then doused with cold water. These acts of torture continued unabated after his transfer to the Metris Prison. Witnesses reported that Ceber’s head was hit against the prison walls until he became unconscious. On 7 October 2008, he was transferred to Bayrampasa hospital and then to Sisli Etfal hospital, where he died on 10 October 2008.
An expert report indicated that Engin Ceber’s death resulted from a “cerebral haemorrhage following traumatic injuries likely to have been caused by blows to the head with a blunt instrument” over the course of the ten days he spent being detained.
Shortly after the report was released, a complaint was filed with the 14th Special Criminal Court of Bakirköy based in Istanbul, against 60 officials including 39 prison guards, three guards, 13 police officers, four soldiers and a doctor.
On 14 October 2008, after having issued an apology to the family of Engin Ceber, the government decided to open an investigation to clarify the circumstances of his death and punish those responsible.
