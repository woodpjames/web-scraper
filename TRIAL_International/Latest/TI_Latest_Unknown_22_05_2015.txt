Ivan Radivojevic is a Kosovo Serb born in Pristina. Radivojevic was a member of the Serbian Reserve Police during the Kosovo war in 1999. At the time of his arrest Radivojevic was thought to be 44 years old, worked as a taxi driver and lived in Blace in Serbia.
According to the indictment of the Basic Court of Pristina, Radivojevic violated the bodily integrity and health of approximately 40 Albanian male civilians in co-perpetration with at least ten other members of various Serbian forces such as the reserve police and other paramilitaries. According to witnesses the Serbian forces assaulted the 40 Albanian civilians at the Kosovo Polje (Serbian name)/Fushe-Kosovo (Albanian name) bus station near Pristina who were trying to flee the war on 26 March 1999.
According to witnesses, the Serbian forces separated the women and children from the men, who were then lined up against a wall, beaten with batons and kicked to the ground. Allegedly, the men were also made to kneel down with their hands behind their heads and forced to sing Serbian songs. Some of them were then taken to unknown destinations. Some of the abducted men were later discovered dead, buried in mass graves. Witnesses declared that they could identify Radivojevic because he was their neighbour.
Radivojevic was suspected of committing war crimes against civilians on 26 March 1999 in Kosovo Polje.
