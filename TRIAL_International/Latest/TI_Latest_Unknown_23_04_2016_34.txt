Toplica Miladinović, also known as “Top”, was born on 18 September 1957 in Rakoš, in the Istok municipality in Serbia.
He is a retired military officer, married and has four children. He finished military high school for ground forces in Zadar, Croatia. He was a serviceman in the army from 1976 until 2003.
Miladinović was a Yugoslav army commander of the 177th intervention squad in Peć, during the international armed conflict in Kosovo which lasted from 24 March 1999 until 20 June 1999.
After 24 March 1999, 177th brigade was mobilised. Miladinović was in charge of the brigade, while Nebojša Minić, who was allegedly under Miladinović’s direct command, was in charge of one platoon in the brigade. Since Minić was known as “Jackal-1”, his whole platoon became known as the “Jackals”.
The Jackal fighters were first considered paramilitaries, but they were all members of the Yugoslav army, with military identification, and they all received salaries from the army.
The four villages of Ljubetić, Pavlan, Zahač and Ćuška in the vicinity of Peć, which were mostly populated by Albanian population, were attacked in April and May 1999.
It was alleged that Miladinović, as a commander, ordered attacks against the civilian population in the area of the town of Peć. Civilians were killed after women and men were separated, their property was stolen, and houses burnt. It was also alleged that the bodies of those killed were burnt, so that their remains would not be found.
Miladinović was arrested in Serbia on 12 March 2010, upon the decision of the investigative judge of the War Crimes Chamber of the High Court in Belgrade.
