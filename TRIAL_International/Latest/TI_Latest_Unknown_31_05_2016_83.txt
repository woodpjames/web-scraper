Army General Sreten Lukic was born on 28 March 1955 in the municipality of Visegrad in Bosnia-Herzegovina. On 1 June 1998, he was appointed Chief of Staff of the Serb Interior Ministry in charge of Kosovo-Metojiha (“Headquarters of MUP”). He held this position during the war, which had been declared on 24 March 1999.
The original indictment alleged that Sreten Lukic as well as Vladimir Lazarevic, Vlastimir Djordjevic and Nebojsa Pavkovic, planned, instigated, ordered, committed or otherwise aided and abetted in preparing certain crimes. According to the indictment Lukic was part of a joint criminal enterprise which had the aim to expel a major part of the Kosovo Albanian civilians from the province in which they were living in order to maintain this province under Serb control.
 
Throughout Kosovo, according to the indictment, FRY and Serbian forces were alleged to have undertaken a widespread or systematic campaign of destruction of property belonging to Kosovo Albanian civilians. Numerous Kosovo Albanians who had not been directly expelled by force from their community were said to have fled due to the climate of terror which had been created in the region by the widespread and systematic campaign of physical aggression, harassment, sexual violence, illegal arrest, murder, bombing and pillaging.
In his position as Chief of Staff of the MUP in charge of Kosovo from 1 June 1998, Sreten Lukic planned, organised, coordinated and controlled the activities of the MUP in Kosovo, and was responsible for ensuring the protection and security of people and their belongings, for the prevention and investigation of crimes and for ensuring the maintenance of public order. Sreten Lukic, being in a position of hierarchical superior within the MUP, had the duty to make sure that the units of the MUP in Kosovo act in conformity with the laws and regulations of the Federation and of the Republic.
