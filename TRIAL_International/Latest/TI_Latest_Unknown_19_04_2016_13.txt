Mukhadi Aziyev was born in Russia. At the relevant time, he was an officer in the Vostok battalion, a regiment created in 2003 and composed of Chechen soldiers as part of the GRU Spetsnaz, the Russian foreign intelligence agency.
On 4 June 2005 a Vostok battalion unit is alleged to have carried out a special operation aimed at identifying combatants of illegal armed forces in the village of Borozdinovskaya. It has been alleged that the raid was carried out in retaliation for the murder of the father of a Battalion member.
On this day at about 03:00 p.m. two armored personnel carriers, and about 15 cars are alleged to have arrived to Borozdinovskaya and dispersed in the streets. Armed soldiers are said to have entered into houses, detained all men, including elderly and teenagers, and to have driven them to the village school. It is then claimed that the men were forced to lie face down and were kicked and beaten with machinegun butts for more than seven hours under heavy rain. Eleven men were then allegedly taken away by the battalion.
In the course of the operation, four houses are said to have been burnt down and one elderly man to have been burnt alive. All victims were Avars from the Tsuntinsky District of Daghestan.
The Office of the Prosecutor of the Grozny Garrison Military Court opened a criminal investigation into these matters and a special group was established in order to conduct an investigation on the allegations of murder, criminal fire and abductions.
