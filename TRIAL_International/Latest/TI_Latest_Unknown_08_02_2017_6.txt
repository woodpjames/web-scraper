On 17 February 2013, the Canadian national Carl Campeau, who had been working as a legal adviser to UN forces (UNDOF) in the Golan Heights, was allegedly abducted by the terrorist organization Jabhat al-Nusra in the Damascus area. As a member of this terrorist organization, Suliman Al-S allegedly participated in the abduction by keeping the victim under surveillance between March and June 2013. Campeau was held captive for 8 months until he managed to escape in October 2013. During this time his captors issued death threats against him and tried unsuccessfully to obtain a ransom for his release.
