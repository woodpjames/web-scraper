facts

Vedaste Banguwiha was born in 1963 in the former prefecture of Cyangugu (now Rusizi), Rwanda. Member of the Democratic Republican Movement for Democracy and Development (MRND), party of former President Juvenal Habyarimana, Banguwiha was an influential businessman in Western Rwanda.
During the Rwandan genocide, he allegedly purchased and provided weapons used for the genocide of Tutsis and moderate Hutus and incited the Interahamwe militia (a Hutu paramilitary organisation) to install roadblocks in the town of Cyangugu, near the hotel des chutes, so as to prevent the escape of Tutsi civilians and kill them. Witnesses also accuse him of facilitating the activities of militias by providing equipment and means of transport as well as rewarding them for the Tutsi killed.
Banguwiha then fled to Belgium, where he also obtained Belgium nationality. Following the transfer to the Belgian authorities of the Rwandese arrest warrant, he moved in 2009 to the Democratic Republic of Congo, where he conducted business with Belgium.
On 25 October 2012, Banguwiha was arrested by Interpol in Katanga in the Democratic Republic of Congo, before being transferred to the Congolese capital of Kinshasa.
