General Rafael Humberto Larios was born in El Salvador. He is a career military man and served as the minister of defence of El Salvador between July 1989 and August 1990.
At dawn on 16 November 1989, Salvadorian military troops invaded the campus of the Universidad Centroamericana “José Simeón Cañas” (UCA) and brutally murdered six Jesuit priests, including the headmaster, as well as the university’s housekeeper and her daughter. According to the report of the Salvadorian United Nations Truth Commission, Rafael Humberto Larios was present at a meeting on 15 November 1989, when the Colonel in charge of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, René Emilio Ponce, ordered Colonel Guillermo Alfredo Benavides Moreno to murder the UCA headmaster. Rafael Humberto Larios also admitted to the Truth Commission that he had met with the Salvadorian president, Alfredo Cristiani, and Rene Emilio Ponce a few hours before the massacre.
In March 2000, the UCA had asked the San Salvador prosecutor to open a new investigation into the murders of the Jesuit priests, including Rafael Humberto Larios’s involvement in the affair. No indictments resulted.
On 13 November 2008, the Spanish Association for Human Rights (APDHE) and the Center for Justice and Accountability (CJA) filed a suit with the Spanish National Court against Rafael Humberto Larios, 13 other Salvadorian military officers and Alfredo Cristiani, the former Salvadorian president.
