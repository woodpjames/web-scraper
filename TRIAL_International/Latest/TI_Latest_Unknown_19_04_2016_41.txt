Abduladhim Maktouf was born on 3 January 1959 in Basra, Iraq. He is a citizen of both Bosnia-Herzegovina and Iraq. He holds a masters in food technology. He was a member of the army of Bosnia-Herzegovina from 8 April 1992 until 17 February 1996.
From 1992 until 1995, an armed conflict was taking place in Bosnia-Herzegovina amongst its three communities- the Orthodox Serbs, Croatian Catholics and the Bosnian Muslims.
During the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Abduladhim Maktouf wilfully gave assistance to a certain Abu Dzafer and other members of the Al Mujahid Unit in the abduction of two civilians of Croatian origin in order to exchange them for five members of this unit who had been captured beforehand by the Croatian army.
Abduladhim Maktouf drove members of the Al Mujahid Unit in his bus to a building where there were Croatian civilians. Members of the Unit went into the building, armed with long barrelled rifles and bayonets, whilst Maktouf Abduladhim waited for them in the bus. They entered the apartment of Ivo Fisic where Kazimer Pobric was also present. Ivo Fisic was taken away forcibly then, under further threat, he was made to climb into the back of the bus waiting at the entry to the building. The same procedure was carried out for Kazimir Pobric. The hostages were then driven to the Ozarac camp, held by the Al Mujahid Unit, close to Travnik. During the same evening, three other civilians were abducted and taken to the Ozarac camp. One of them was decapitated during a ritual ceremony, whereas the others were subsequently released. Kazimir Pobric was released from the camp on 23 October 1993 and Ivo Fisc was freed on 6 November 1993. Maktouf Abduladhim participated only in the abduction of the latter two.
Abduladhim Maktouf was arrested on 12 June 2004.
