facts

Mirsad Repak was born in 1966. During the Bosnian War that broke out in the first half of 1992, Mirsad Repak was a member of the Croatian Armed Forces (HOS). He is married with two children.
The HOS, before being absorbed by the end of 1992 by the Croatian Home Guard (HVO), was a Croatian far-right militia, active in both Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina between 1991 and 1992. Confronted with the downfall of the central leadership of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the resistance of the Bosnian Croats was first organized around the HOS under the command of Blaz Kraljevic. Many detention centres were opened in Bosnia, where a lot of civilians, mostly Bosnian Serbs, were imprisoned, tortured and killed. Among these centres was the Dretelj camp, located in the south of the city of Mostar, that was particularly known for its degrading prison conditions and brutality of its guardians.
Several pieces of evidence report the harsh and unsanitary conditions of the Dretelj camp due to overcrowding, lack of nourishment and water but also due to mistreatments, humiliation and sexual abuse that were inflicted on a daily basis to the prisoners.
The bill of indictment alleges that, during the time the facts took place Mirsad Repak was not only, as he claims, the bodyguard of General Blaz Kraljevic and an average Dretelj camp guardian, but he also exercised greater power in this camp, acting as a chief inspector.
Between May and October 1992 Mirsad Repak was allegedly involved in illegal imprisonment, torture and other cruel treatments as well as in a reported case of rape against 18 Serb civilians, men and women confined in the aforementioned camp.
In 1993, Mirsad Repak moved with his family to Norway, to a suburb of Oslo, as an asylum-seeker. He was hired as an employee in an institution for children in need. He obtained Norwegian citizenship in 2001.
Mirsad Repak was arrested by the Norwegian authorities in May 2007.
