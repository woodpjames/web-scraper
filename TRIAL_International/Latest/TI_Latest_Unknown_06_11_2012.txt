facts 

Augusto Pinochet Ugarte was born on 25 November 1915.
General Pinochet came to power following the coup d’état of 11 September 1973 which led to the overthrow of President Salvador Allende. As a result a military junta was formed headed by Pinochet. He then declared a state of siege, introduced martial law, closed parliament, censored the media and began to suppress left-wing opposition parties. An official report estimated that 3,197 persons were killed and 967 disappeared during the 17 years of Pinochet’s presidency (National Commission of Truth and Reconciliation’s report, the so-called Rettig Commission).
In 1980 a new constitution came into force scheduling a presidential plebiscite in 1988 with Pinochet as unique candidate. Against all expectations Pinochet was not elected which led to the organization of open presidential elections in 1989. In 1990 Pinochet transferred power to his successor but remained Commander-in-Chief of the Army until March 1998. Upon leaving that post, Pinochet became senator for life, a position he gave up in 2002 because of health problems.
General Pinochet was accused of having taken part in “Operation Condor”, a campaign of assassination and intelligence-gathering, dubbed counter-terrorism, and conducted jointly by the security services of Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay in the mid-1970s with the aim of eliminating political opponents abroad.
Pinochet was also suspected of being the mastermind behind a military unit allegedly responsible for the execution of 75 opponents in different cities in Chile between September and October 1973 (Case known as the “Caravan of Death”). He was also suspected of having had knowledge of the operations undertaken in Chile and abroad by the secret police agency DINA – National Intelligence Directorate – and its role in the implementation of Operation Condor.
