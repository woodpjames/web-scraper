Saadi Gaddafi was born on 25 May 1973 in Tripoli, Libya. He is the second son of the former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and Safia Farkash.
It is alleged that in 2005 Saadi Gaddafi murdered national team player and Tripoli football club coach Bashir Al-Ryani, a noted critic of Muammar Gaddafi. Saadi Gaddafi is also alleged to have misappropriated property by force and armed intimidation during his tenure as President of the Libyan Football Federation.
Saadi Gadaffi, along with his elder brother Saif Gaddafi, has also been charged with committing war crimes while serving as commander of Libya’s Special Forces during Libya’s 2011 civil war.
Specifically, both brothers have been charged with coordinating a campaign of murder, torture, and bombardment of civilians during the conflict.
Among other purported crimes committed during the war, an eyewitness accused Gaddafi of ordering soldiers to open fire at over 200 unarmed protesters in Benghazi. While Gaddafi has acknowledged he was at the protest site when soldiers opened fire, he has denied giving the order.
In September 2011, Gaddafi escaped to Niger.. This was confirmed in November 2011 by the President of Niger, Mahamadou Issoufou, who also stated that the Nigerien authorities had granted Saadi Gaddafi asylum for “humanitarian reasons”.
