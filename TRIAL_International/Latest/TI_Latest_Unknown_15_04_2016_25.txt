Adam Nagorny, born in 1917, was a Ukrainian who served as a soldier in the Red Army and was taken prisoner by the Germans and trained in the Trawniki camp to become a guard of the Nazi camp system.
Nagorny served as an armed SS guard at the Treblinka I concentration camp whose prisoners were used to build the nearby Treblinka II camp where he is accused of participating in more than 3000 killings of the inmate between 1941-42.
A German prosecutor in Munich opened a murder investigation against Nagorny after he had received evidence against him in another investigation on John Demjanjuk.
