Baghdadi Ali Al Mahmudi was born in Zaouïa, Libya in 1945. He has a diploma in medicine and has specialised in obstetrics and gynecology. He was secretary to the health department and served as Deputy Prime Minister to Prime Minister Shukri Ghanem until he was appointed to replace him. He was a part of Gaddafi’s inner circle prior to his escape in mid-2011.
From 2006 until 2011, Mahmudi was the Secretary of the General People’s Committee and headed the Liaison Office of the Revolutionary Committees in Libya. He also held the chairmanship of both the Libyan Investment Authority (large wealth funds) and the Libyan Oil and Gas Council.
On 26 February 2011, the United Nations Security Council issued Resolution 1970 which imposed a travel ban on him.
On 21 August 2011, Mahmudi fled to Djerba in Tunisia but was captured on 22 September 2011 by the Tunisian authorities and sentenced to 6 months in jail for illegal entry in Tunisia.
On 8 November 2011, a Tunisian court ruled that Mahmudi should be extradited to Libya. His lawyer, Mabrouk Korchid fearing that he would be subjected to torture if returned to Libya, said that it was an unfair and political decision. On 4 December 2011, Tunisian interim President Foued Mebazaa confirmed that he would not sign a decree to extradite Mahmudi
On 24 June 2012, after a lengthy process, it was reported that Mahmudi was finally extradited to Libya. His lawyer argued that he was beaten by Libyan security officers in Tripoli after his extradition.
