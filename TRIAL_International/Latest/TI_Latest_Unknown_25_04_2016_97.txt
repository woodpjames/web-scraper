facts

Perica Adzic was a fighter in the Croatian Defence Council (HVO) during the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the armed conflict between units of the HVO and the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
He is accused of having tortured and caused great suffering to wounded and captured members of the Bosnian Army. The soldiers were being treated and held by the HVO at Rade Kondić primary school in the town of Žepče in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The indictment alleges that Adzic entered the school in July 1993 with another member of the HVO and proceeded to threaten wounded prisoners with his pistol, smash the saline drips of two wounded prisoners, shoot a wounded prisoner, and threaten with his pistol a young child visiting his wounded mother.
The indictment charging Adzic with the war crime of torture and inhumane treatment against the wounded and sick was confirmed on 7 January 2014.
