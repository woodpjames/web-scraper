UN examination of the Burundi: civil society condemns a human rights crisis
26.07.2016
Geneva, 26 July 2016 – A coalition of Burundian NGOs[1], with the support of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), the International Federation of Action by Christians for the Abolition of Torture (FIACAT), TRIAL International, the Centre for Civil and Political Rights (CCPR) and DefendDefenders (East and Horn of Africa Human Rights Defenders Project) have submitted a report condemning a resurgence in extrajudicial executions, enforced disappearances, arbitrary arrests and cases of torture.
During the 58th session of the United Nations Committee against Torture (CAT) from 25 July to 12 August, Burundi will exceptionally be examined by experts of the CAT following the deterioration of the human rights situation in the country, triggered by a deep-rooted political crisis affecting the country since 2015.
Civil society has provided experts with an alternative report describing the alarming situation in the country since its last review by the CAT in 2014, and in particular the worsening situation in light of the 2015 political crisis. The report documents numerous violations of the Convention, such as the increased use of torture, poor treatment during arbitrary arrests and detention, and a significant increase in extrajudicial executions and enforced disappearances.
The signatories are also deeply concerned by the lack of investigations into these violations and by the culture of impunity prevailing throughout the country.
The recommendations of the report call on the Burundian government to put a stop to these violations, to prosecute those responsible, and to guarantee compensation for victims.
The report is available in French and English.
The review of Burundi can be followed live at www.treatybodywebcast.org (10:00 CET on 28 July; 15:00 CET on 29 July).
