On 24 March 1976, a military junta seized power and began the “Dirty War” in which successive juntas (1976-1983) wanted to eliminate what they called “subversive and terrorist thinking,” which means “all persons who spread ideas contrary to Western and Christian civilization.” The soldiers opened several hundred secret prisons where they tortured the opponents and made them disappear. It is estimated that soldiers killed or disappeared between 10,000 and 30,000 people. More than 500,000 Argentines went into exile to escape repression.
On 22 April 1985, after the return of democracy, the Judiciary opened proceedings against members of the three juntas that governed Argentina until 1983. This produced a flood of charges and complaints against the soldiers. To put an end this situation, on 23 December 1986, Parliament and the government of Raul Alfonsin adopted Law 23.492 “the Final Point” which gave the judges 60 days to end all of the trials against the soldiers for crimes against humanity.
In February 1987, at the end of this 60-day period, several officials that had been called to testifying before the court, locked themselves in a barracks in Cordoba. In June 1987, fearing a coup, Parliament enacted a new law called “Due Obedience” which declared that all military personnel under the rank of lieutenant colonel could not be tried because they only obeyed their superiors. This reduced the “triable” to less than 30 officials. The two laws are known as “the amnesty laws”.
In 1989, President Carlos Menem released all of the soldiers and police (and some Montoneros) with a decree of amnesty.
In March 2001, Federal Judge Cavallo declared the laws unconstitutional. In October of the same year, Federal Judge Bonadio sustained that declaration, and the Supreme Court upheld those positions.
In August 2003, the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate overrode both laws. On 14 June 2005, the Supreme Court ruled the annulment valid. Therefore, there are no obstacles to prosecute all of the torturers.
Little is known of General Verplaetsen’s past. He made his entire career in the Army. It is known that at the end of the dictatorship, in 1983, he was the Chief of Police in Buenos Aires. During this period, he officially decorated Luis Patti, who is currently accused of crimes against humanity.
In 2005, the Supreme Court confirmed the nullity of the amnesty laws and therefore there are no obstacles to re-open the trials against the military officials.
General Verplaetsen (and others) is accused of the murder of Floreal Avellaneda.
