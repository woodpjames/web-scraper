facts

Bedi Mobuli Engangela was born in 1974 in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Engangela first joined the Armed forces of the Democratic Republic of Congo (FARDC) when it was under the direction of former DRC President Joseph Mobutu. However, he soon defected from the FARDC to join a militia group. Engangela was reintegrated into the FARDC in 2005 as part of a peace deal adopted by the DRC Parliament, and consequently assigned to the 106 battalion in the DRC’s South Kivu province.
It is alleged that Engangela deserted the FARDC for a second time from 2005-2007 to form a militia group that trained child soldiers. Engangela is accused of leading a series of raids targeting several villages in the South Kivu province. These raids are said to have primarily involved acts of murder, mass rape, kidnapping and sexual slavery against an estimated 900 civilian villagers. During this time period, Engangela also purportedly collaborated with the Democratic Forces of the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), a Rwandan rebel group based in the DRC.
In 2007, Engangela was arrested and placed into preventative custody in the DRC, while Congolese authorities investigated accusations of his militia’s unlawful conduct.
