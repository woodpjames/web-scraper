TRIAL acts before the UN Committee against Torture
01.04.2014
In April 2013, TRIAL submitted an alternative report to the UN Committee against Torture.
The report analyses the state of implementation of the Convention against Torture by Kenyan authorities and it focuses in particular on the human rights situation prevailing in Kenya’s Mont Elgon disctrict, notably the massive violations committed there in 2008 and the enduring and complete state of impunity that still lingers.
