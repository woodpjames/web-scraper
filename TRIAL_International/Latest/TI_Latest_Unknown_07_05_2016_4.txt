Petar Kovačević was born on 23 October 1943. He was a member of the Republika Srpska army during the conflict in the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s and, as such, he allegedly participated in the systematic attack by the Republika Srpska army, police and paramilitary formations, against the Bosniak civilian population in the municipality of Višegrad from May 1992 through late August 1992.
Kovačević, as a member of the Republika Srpska army, participated in the persecution of the civilian population of Višegrad between May and late August of 1992 through the shooting and raping of civilians as well as the destruction and burning of buildings in the area.
Some specific allegations have arisen through the course of the legal proceedings stating that allegedly Kovačević set fire to the houses and barns of civilians, Asim and Dervis Kustra, in Zlatnick in late July 1992; three women were killed in the fire.
Kovačević also allegedly sought out another civilian man, tracking him down in a religious school in Dobrun and shooting and killing him with a rifle.
Another courtroom witness has testified that Kovačević allegedly took her brother, along with others, for questioning and when her brother would allegedly not answer the questions they took him to a stream and shot him.
Summarily, Kovačević’s actions were part of the attack on the civilian population of the Višegrad municipality on political, national, ethnic and religious grounds, by way of detention, murder, forcing another person by the use of force or threat of imminent attack on their lives as well as rape.
The Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina confirmed on 16 July 2014 the Indictment under which Kovačević is charged with the criminal offense of Crimes against Humanity in violation of Article 172(1)(h) of the Criminal Code of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
