facts 

Mikhail Gorshkow, an ethnic Russian born in 1923 in Estonia, was a former interpreter and interrogator for the Gestapo in Minsk.
Alleged to have been an interrogator for the Gestapo, he was accused of involvement in the murder of about 3,000 men, women and children in the Jewish ghetto of the city of Slutsk, in Belarus in 1943. Three thousand men, women and children were shot to death or burned alive when the Nazis set fire to the ghetto and prevented Jews from leaving. In addition to Gorshkow’s participation in the mass killings at Slutsk, he was suspected of having helped interrogate political prisoners and of having participated in so-called “anti-partisan” operations involving the torture, deportation, and murder of thousands of civilians.
Around 1,000 Estonian Jews were killed during the German occupation of Belarus, and more than 4,000 Jews and others were brought to the country and murdered.
In 1951, Gorshkow immigrated to the United States from Germany. He became a United States citizen in 1963. The United States revoked Gorshkow’s citizenship on 31 July 2002, because he had allegedly obtained it illegally by lying about his wartime past. He was later extradited to Estonia, where state officials opened an investigation into Gorshkow’s alleged participation in Nazi war crimes in Belarus.
