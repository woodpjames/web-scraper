facts

Heinrich Boere was born on 27 September 1921 in Eschweiler. From September 1940 he decided to volunteer in the Waffen-SS. In June 1941, he left in order to fight at the Eastern front and the Caucasus.
From 1943 onwards, Boere became a member of the Waffen-SS squad of Dutch volunteers—the Sonderkommando Feldmeijer—which is argued to be responsible for killing 54 alleged members of the Dutch resistance in retaliation for anti-Nazi acts.
According to the allegations, in July 1944, Boere and another SS member, Jacobus Petrus Besteman, killed pharmacist Fritz Hubert Ernst Bicknese after being ordered to do so by the Security Services.
In addition, Boere and Henrik Kromhout are accused of having killed in September 1944, Teun de Groot, a bicycle-shop owner, who hid fugitives in his shop. Then they went to F.W. Kusters, a member of the Dutch resistance, and shot him after having forced him into their car.
