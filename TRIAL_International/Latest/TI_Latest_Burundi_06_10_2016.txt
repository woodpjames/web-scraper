06.10.2016
Geneva, 6 October 2016 – Today, one of TRIAL International’s representatives has been asked by the Burundian authorities to leave the country, following the revocation of her visa.
Ms Capizzi joined TRIAL in September 2014. She is a Legal Advisor and Head of TRIAL International’s Burundi program. Prior to that, she did previous assignments for the International Committee of the Red Cross, the European Court for Human Rights and the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Pamela Capizzi was on a professional mission in Bujumbura since 2 October when her visa was revoked:
“Burundian authorities granted me with a visa, knowing that I was going to Burundi to deliver a legal training. The reasons to revoke it while I was still in the country were not communicated to me. I could nonetheless leave the country without any problem”, said Pamela Capizzi.
TRIAL International’s mission in Burundi is to contribute to durably improve the judiciary system and to facilitate access to justice to victims of international crimes.
“Pamela Capizzi is a tremendously committed staff member with an irreproachable work ethic. She delivered a training with the corresponding rigor and professionalism. She has our full support and endorsement ”, said Philip Grant, TRIAL International’s Director.
