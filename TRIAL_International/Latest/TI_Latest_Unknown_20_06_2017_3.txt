Facts

Abdelkarim El B. was born in Germany in 1986. After radicalising in Germany, he moved to Syria in September 2013, where he was a registered member of the so-called “Islamic state” (IS) fighting close to Aleppo.
During his time in Syria, he allegedly filmed with his mobile phone IS members mutilating a dead soldier of the opposing side while commenting on the incident in a degrading manner. After the head of the soldier had been severed from his corpse, El B. and his fellow fighters allegedly played with it.
