facts


Alfredo Astiz was born on 17 November 1950. He was lieutenant of a frigate belonging to the Navy Mechanics School (ESMA), and at that time he was put in charge of an undercover group. Very quickly, he tried to infiltrate the “Mothers of the May Square” organisation under the name of Gustavo Niño, under the pretext of having a brother who had “disappeared”.
In December 1977, Astiz was implicated in the disappearance of two French nuns, Sister Alice Domon and Sister Leonie Duquet, whose remains have never been found.
In 1978, he was to be found in France, with a mission to infiltrate the Argentinean refugee community.
In June 1979 he was appointed assistant naval attaché to South Africa.
During the Falklands war between Argentina and Britain, he was responsible for the main island of Georgia, and it was he who signed the surrender treaty on 10 June 1982. He was taken prisoner by the British.
On 22 December 1987, Alfredo Astiz was promoted to become Captain of a war frigate.
In January 1998, President Carlos Menem signed a decree discharging the officer due to an irresponsible attitude on his part which had led to a situation seriously affecting the prestige of the navy, as well as other institutions.
