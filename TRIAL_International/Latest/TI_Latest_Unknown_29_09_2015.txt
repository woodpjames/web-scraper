The region of Srebrenica was a key battleground during the Bosnia conflict, with many civilian fatalities. Bosnian Muslims gathered in the municipality’s centrally located town, which became a UN Protected Zone. The town was subsequently captured by the Serbian Army. It is estimated that 8,000 Bosnian Muslims were massacred. The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia ruling in Prosecutor vs Krstic referred to this incident as the “Srebrenica Genocide”.
Together with other members of the Unit, Vaso Todorovic allegedly participated in the genocide of 1,000 Bosnian Muslim men in Srebrenica during the period 10th July 1995 to 19th July 1995
It is alleged that Vaso Todorovic was carrying out security duties in the Bratunac Municipality on 13th July 1995. It is alleged that Vaso Todorovic and the other security personnel of the Second Squad Šekovici Detachment separated a group of up to 30 Muslim men from thousands detained in the village of Sandici and handed them over to unknown members of the Army of Republic Srpska. The men in question subsequently disappeared without trace. It is also alleged by the Prosecutor that Vaso Todorovic and the Second Squad Šekovici Detachment detained and later executed over 1,000 civilian Bosnian Muslim men in a warehouse in Kravica, near Srebrenica.
Vaso Todorovic further allegedly participated in the forced relocation of 25,000 Bosnian Muslim women, children and elderly persons on 12th July 1995 and 13 July 1995.
