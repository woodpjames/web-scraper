facts


Zeljko Jukic was a member of the Croatia Defence Council (HVO), the main military force of Croats in Bosnia and Herzegovina during the Bosnian war.
Between July and September 1993, Jukic allegedly took part in a widespread and systematic attack against Bosnian cilivians. He was later accused, together with two other Bosnian Croat fighters, of having taken three men from the local High School Centre in Prozor, which was used as a makeshift prison, to a rubbish dump in August 1993. While one of the captives managed to escape, the other two prisoners disappeared and were never seen again. The same happened to two other men who were held as prisoners in the High School Centre. They also disappeared without a trace after Jukic separated them from the other prisoners and took them away.
Besides these two incidents, Jukic allegedly took other Bosnian civilians from Prozor to the Dretelj detention camp and subjected them to mistreatment by beating them with sticks, punching and kicking them. In addition, he was accused of having looted in the villages of Visnjani and Lapsunj. In the village of Ustine he allegedly forced imprisoned Bosniak civilians to fight each other for his entertainment in 1993. Finally, Jukic allegedly tortured a man in July 1993 at a fire station in Prozor by putting a lit cigarette to his cheek and burning the manâ€™s beard.
Jukic was found guilty of the forced disappearance of five people, torture, looting and forced displacement of people during the period of July and September 1993.
