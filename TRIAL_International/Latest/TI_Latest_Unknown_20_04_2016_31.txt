Mikhail Farbtukh was born around 1919.
In 1940, as Latvia was being occupied by the USSR, he became head of the NKVD (predecessor of the KGB) for the city of Daugavpils. As such, he took part in the deportation by the USSR of thousands of Latvians.
In 1941, he allegedly supervised the deportation of 31 Latvian citizens to Siberia. Most of them were patriots, member of the Latvian intelligentsia (lawyers, doctors, academics, …) who had supported the nationalist government in-between the two wars. Out of these 31 persons, 4 were executed in Russia, the rest of them died of cold and hunger during deportation.
Mikhail Farbtukh was indicted in the late 1990’s, as prosecutions were being launched in the Baltic States against criminals of the soviet period.
