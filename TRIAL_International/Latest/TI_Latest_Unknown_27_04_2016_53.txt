facts

Rasema Handanovic was born in 1972 and she was a member of the “Zulflikar” Special Purposes Detachment with the headquarters of the High Command of the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 1996, Rasema Handanovic emigrated to the United States where she obtained US citizenship in 2002. She lived with her son and parents in the Portland suburb of Beaverton in Oregon.
Handanovic was allegedly involved in an attack on the village of Trusina in Bosnia on 16 April 1993. During the attack, 16 civilians and four members of the Croatian Defense Council, who had surrendered, were allegedly killed. Furthermore, four civilians were seriously injured during the event, including two infants.
According to the Prosecutor of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Rasema Handanovic is believed to have personally taken part in executing three soldiers of the Croatian Defense Council who had surrendered to the Bosnian Army, as well as in the execution of three civilians. According to the extradition request, Handanovic is suspected of having personally shot a civilian woman in the chest two or three times, which led to the woman’s death. Handanovic is further suspected to have shot and killed an elderly couple, between 65-70 years of age, with an automatic rifle. The same day, Handanovic allegedly took part in the “firing-squad”-style execution of unarmed, captured soldiers of the Croatian Defence Council. It is alleged that after the shooting stopped, Handanovic went to the individuals on the ground that still showed signs of life and fired additional shots at close range at them.
Following an extradition request by Bosnia and Herzegovina, Handanovic was arrested in April 2011 and extradited to Sarajevo on 27 December 2011.
