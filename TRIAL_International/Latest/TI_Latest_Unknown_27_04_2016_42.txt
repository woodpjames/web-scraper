facts

Evariste Bicamumpaka was born in the city of Nyaruhengeri, Butare district, Rwanda in 1962. Although his youth is undocumented, information are available from 22 May 1991, date on which he has been nominated as sub-prefect in charge of social affairs in Butare district, at the age of 29. Bicamumpaka was also an active member of the National revolutionary movement for development (Mouvement révolutionnaire national pour le développpement, MRND).
Using this political mandate, Bicamumpaka supposedly supported the interahamwe militia by furnishing weapons and participating as well as organizing self defence committees in Butare. A local administration meeting scheduled by Bicamumpaka in the Prefect’s name on 17 June 1994 comprised orders of the day such as “modalities for the creation of warring units in the cities” and “organisation of searches in houses”.
Bicamumpaka’s name appears on the list of people suspected of having committed crimes of genocide in Rwanda and living abroad issued in 2006 by the Prosecutor general in Rwanda. Bicamumpaka is believed to have escaped to Canada and would have been seen in Vancouver in 2010.
An arrest warrant for Bicamumpaka has been issued by Rwanda for crime of genocide. According to the Rwandan government, an extradition request has been sent to Canada in 2007, without response for the time being.
