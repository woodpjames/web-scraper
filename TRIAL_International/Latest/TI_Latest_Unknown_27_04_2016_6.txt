facts

Herbert Stommel was born on 20 September 1918. Major of the German Armed Forces (Wehrmacht), during the Second World War was deployed in Northern Italy with his unit, the ‘Gebirgs-Pionier-Bataillon 818’.
On 26 June 1944 a group of partisans operating around the little town of Falzano di Cortona, in Tuscany, killed in an operation two members of a Wehrmacht patrol. The only soldier who survived the attack reached the unit commanded by Stommel and by Josef Scheungraber, which was fixing a damaged bridge in the same area. The two officers, informed of the attack, planned a reprisal against the surrounding population.
The German troops first shot dead six randomly met farmers. The troops commanded by Stommel were mainly sappers, and were provided with high amounts of explosive. They pushed other 11 civilians inside an house, and blasted it using dynamite. There was only one survivor.
Stommel and Scheungraber went unpunished for nearly 50 years, until new documents were found in Italy in 1994 about the crimes committed by the occupying power in Italy during World War II. On 16 February 2004 Herbert Stommel and Josef Scheungraber were indicted by the Military Tribunal of La Spezia.
