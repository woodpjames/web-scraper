Shigetaro Shimada was born on 24 September 1883; he graduated from the Naval Academy in November 1904. Shimada rose through the ranks of the Imperial Japanese Navy and eventually became an admiral. Prior to World War II, Shimada held a variety of senior naval positions including Vice Chief of the Naval General Staff and Chief of the China Fleet. In October 1941, Shigetaro Shimada became Navy Minister in the Tojo (see “related cases”) Cabinet and held that office until August 1944. For a period of six months from February to August 1944 he was also Chief of the Navy General Staff. Appointed to the Supreme War Council in August 1944, he retired to the Reserve in January 1945.
According to the judgement handed down by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East (IMTFE), from the formation of the Tojo Cabinet until the Western Powers were attacked by Japan on 7 December 1941, Shimada took part in all the decisions “made by the conspirators in planning and launching that attack”.
After war was declared he played a principal role in carrying out war operations. Shimada was captured by the Allies in 1945 and put on trial by the IMTFE.
