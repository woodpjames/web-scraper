facts

Karl-Leonhard Paulov was born in 1925.
This former agent of the NKVD (the Ministry of State Security’s secret services) took part in Stalinist repression of opponents in Baltic countries occupied by the USSR, and participated in the deportation of 40 Estonians to Siberia.
In 1945, he killed three ‘Forest Brothers’, members of the Estonian resistance who engaged in armed resistance to the Soviet occupation, and who took refuge in the forests of the county of Võru. Aleksander Sibul was killed on 18 October 1945, Alfred and Aksel Pärli on 27 October 1945. The last two were shot in the back. Karl-Leonhard Paulov allegedly received payment for executing these three members of the resistance, as well as a guarantee that he would not be sanctioned by the Soviet authorities for having previously enrolled in the German army. As proof of his compliance, he is said to have brought to his superiors a false tooth belonging to one of his victims.
In the late nineties, Karl-Leonhard Paulov was charged with crimes against humanity for the murder of the three members of the resistance.
