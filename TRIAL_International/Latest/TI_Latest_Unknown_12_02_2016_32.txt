General Context 
It is estimated that between 100,000 and 200,000 persons died as a consequence of the conflict in BiH during the period 1992-1995 and that between 25,000 and 30,000 were victims of enforced disappearance. As of today, between 8,000 and 10,000 people are still missing without trace. The enforced disappearance of the 39 victims in this case took place during the first wave of the “ethnic cleansing” operations perpetrated by the Serb army during the military attack on a number of villages and towns surrounding Sarajevo between May and June 1992.
