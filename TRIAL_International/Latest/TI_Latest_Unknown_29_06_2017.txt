“Justice is never easy, but universal jurisdiction is here to stay”

An op-ed by Manuel Vergara 
Manuel Vergara, Legal Director at FIBGAR and a collaborator to TRIAL’s universal jurisdiction annual report, on victims’ clout, the Habré trial and legal setbacks.  
The reason behind universal jurisdiction’s success is unquestionably the commitment of victims seeking justice beyond their countries’ boundaries. This is itself connected to better information on international criminal law and its mechanisms, the dissemination of clauses like aut dedere aut iudicare* in treaties and the professional work of independent judges and prosecutors.
Universal jurisdiction has known its ups and downs. Many commentators and scholars feared it would disappear after two of the most active countries in this field, Spain and Belgium, backpedaled on their power to prosecute international criminals. But it has proved it is here to stay. The proliferation of new cases in Africa and South America is an encouraging sign for the future.
