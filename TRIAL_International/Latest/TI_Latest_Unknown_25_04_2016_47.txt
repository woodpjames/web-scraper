facts


Jean-Claude Iyamuremye was born in Rwanda in 1978. A member of the Hutu ethnic group, he is suspected of having been a leader of an Interahamwe militia during the Rwandan Genocide and of having been complicit in the murder and attempted genocide of the Tutsi people on several occasions.
The indictment by the Government of Rwanda alleges that on 7 April 1994, Iyamuremye lead an Interahamwe militia to invade the homes of two Tutsi Rwandans. When they did not find the Tutsis for whom they were looking, the Interahamwe militia led by Iyamuremye is alleged to have burned down the homes.
On 11 April 1994, he is alleged to have led an Interahamwe militia in bringing a group of Tutsi refugees to the Official Technical School (ETO) in Kigali, Rwanda. He is alleged to have then participated in the ensuing Interahamwe massacre in the ETO and to have participated in a subsequent deadly attack on those who had escaped the massacre alive.
In May 1994, he is accused of having attacked a pharmaceutical dispensary where Tutsi refugees had taken refuge. The attacking force consisted of several Hutu extremists and left at least eight Tutsis dead. He is also accused of having, between 7 April 1994 and 17 July 1994, rounded up Tutsis in his white Toyota pick-up truck and brought them to the town of Rubirizi, Kicukiro where they were subsequently murdered and thrown into a common grave.
After the genocide, Iyamuremye fled to the Netherlands where he lived in the village of Voorburg for almost 20 years with his wife and children. On 25 September 2013, the Rwandan government requested that the Dutch government extradite him in order to face trial in Rwanda for genocide and war crimes. He was arrested and detained by the Dutch police in July 2013 in response to this request of the Rwandan government.
