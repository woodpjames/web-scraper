Ignace Murwanashyaka was born in 1963 in Butare, Rwanda. Since 1989, he has been living in exile in Germany. In 2000, Germany granted him political asylum.
In 2001, Murwanashyaka became the head of the Democratic Liberation Forces of Rwanda (known by their French acronym FDLR), formerly the « Armée de libération du Rwanda ». The FDLR are considered to be the main cause of insecurity in the African Great Lakes Region.
Murwanashyaka is accused of coordinating human rights vilations committed by the FDLR between January 2008 and July 2009. In particular, Murwanshyaka is allegedly responsible of attacks in Kipopo, Mianga, Busurungi, Kubua and Manje. The FDLR reportedly killed several hundred civilians, pillaged and burned down numerous villages and left many women raped or subjected to other forms of sexual violence. Numerous child soldiers were allegedly recruited by force in order to carry out such operations.
In 2005, the United Nations Security Council issued sanctions against the Rwandan Hutu rebels and Congolese militia. For Murwanashyaka these sanctions included travel bans and the freezing of his foreign assets.
