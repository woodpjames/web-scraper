facts

Johan Tarculovski was born on 17 November 1974 in the town of Skopje in the Republic of Macedonia, then a part of the Federal Socialist Republic of Yugoslavia.
In 2001 he was a civil servant in the police forces with the title of “Escort Inspector” to the presidential security service.
Between Friday 10 August 2001 and Sunday 12 August 2001, a land offensive was launched by the army and the Macedonian police against Albanian civilians and their private property in the village of Ljuboten. During this attack, which was not justified by any pressing military requirements, several Albanian civilians were arrested, placed in detention, subjected to cruel and inhumane treatment and murdered. Several hundred private dwellings and other private holdings were either partially or totally destroyed (cf. Annex A of the Indictment).
Between July and August 2001, Johan Tarculovski was said to have personally recruited and provided equipment to the police forces which took part in the offensive against Ljuboten.
Between 10 and 12 August 2001, it was he who allegedly planned the attack against the village. He chose the timing, the methods used, the implementation, the objectives and the targets to be hit.
He was said to have personally and directly taken part in the attacks by giving out orders and, in person, leading his troops.
Johan Tarculovski was charged on the 22 December 2004 together with Ljube Boskoski on three counts of violations of the laws and customs of war.
He was transferred from Skopje to The Hague on 21 March 2005.
