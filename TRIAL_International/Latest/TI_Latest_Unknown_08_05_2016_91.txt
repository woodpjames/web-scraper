facts 


Innocent Bagabo was born on 4 December 1966 in Umwiga, in the prefecture of Kibungo, now the District of Kayonza, Eastern Province, Rwanda. Bagabo was a school teacher.
Bagabo’s parents are of two different ethnic origins: while his mother is Tutsi, his father is Hutu. During the genocide of 1994, his mother’s family was massacred because of its ethnic origin, while his father and sister were murdered by the troops of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF). Reportedly, Bagabo managed to escape the mass killing by fleeing to Tanzania, where he obtained refugee status.
When the genocide was over, Bagabo returned to Rwanda where he joined a reconciliation committee. He then became a human rights investigator (Enquêteur des Droits de l’Homme).
Bagabo alleges that, during his mandate, he was pressured to falsely accuse certain persons, but refused to do so. Bagabo eventually left Rwanda to move to France, where he obtained asylum, then French citizenship.
According to the Rwandese justice, Bagabo actively participated to the massacre during the genocide. Bagabo is thus charged on three counts: one count of genocide, another of aiding and abetting the genocide, and one count of crimes against humanity.
