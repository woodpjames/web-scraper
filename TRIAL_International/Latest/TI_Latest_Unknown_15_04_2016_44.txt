Renato Petrov, who was born in 1969, is a former Serbo-Croatian police officer. His indictment for war crimes goes back to the conflict in former Yugoslavia, at the end of 1991.
The village of Skabrnja in Croatia was taken by force by Serbian paramilitary units and by troops of the Yugoslav Peopleâ€™s Army on 18 November 1991. The following day, these same forces attacked the neighboring village of Nadin, where many civilians had sought refuge. Between 18 November 1991 and the month of March 1992, 62 civilians and 7 prisoners of war were executed. Overall, 86 persons were killed amongst which were many women and elderly people.
The allegations concerning Petrov dated back to 18 November 1991. He was found guilty in 1995 by the Court of Zadar due to his presumed role in the murder of 43 civilians on that date. He was sentenced in absentia, to 20 years imprisonment, as were 15 other defendants. This decision was confirmed by the Supreme Court of Croatia in 1998. He was then later acquitted in 2011 for lack of evidence against him. He never, therefore, spent any time behind bars.
