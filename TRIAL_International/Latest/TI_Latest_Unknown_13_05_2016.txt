Vlastimir Golijan was a member of the Bosnian-Serb armyâ€™s special Sabotage Unit, which was founded by Bosnian-Serb army leader Ratko Mladic.
One of the leaders of this unit, Franc Kos, admitted during a trial against him that his unit participated in the execution of about 800 Muslim men and boys aged between 16 and 80 years on 16 July 1995. The victims were driven in buses to an army site at Branjevo, situated about 70 km north of Srebrenica. There they were lined up and shot in the back. Golijan allegedly participated in this crime as part of the unit.
Vlastimir Golijan was under the age of 21 when he committed the executions.
