Enforced disappearance of Mr. Yahia Kroumi in August 1994
12.02.2016
General Context 
These events took place within the context of the Algerian civil war during which thousands of persons, among which Mr. Yahia Kroumi, disappeared. Coming out of a bloody national liberation war, Algeria was plunged into a fratricidal conflict leading to a disproportionate use of violence and massive violations of human rights. According to different information sources, 7,000 to 20,000 persons were arrested or abducted by all corps of Algerian security services and the militia armed by the government between 1992 and 1998, and are still missing.
To date, none of the victims’ families have received information about their relatives, no investigation has ever been opened as a result of the criminal complaint and the procedure they have completed, and, thought the persons who committed the crimes and the backers are known, none of them have ever been prosecuted or troubled.
Furthermore, since the promulgation in February 2006 of the Charter for Peace and National Reconciliation, the victims’ families are confronted with the legal prohibition of bringing their cases, such as that of Mr. Yahia Kroumi, before courts at the risk of being sanctioned by the Algerian criminal system because Algeria considers that taking these steps would be tantamount to “exploit and take advantage of the wounds of the national tragedy” and undermine the on-going national reconciliation process.
