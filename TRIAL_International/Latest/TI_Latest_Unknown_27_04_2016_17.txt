facts

Emmanuel Mbarushimana was born in 1961 or 1962 in Rwanda. He was a former primary school inspector in Butare prefecture. During the Rwandan genocide that took place from 6 April 1994, when Juvénal Habyarimana was assassinated, through mid July, he allegedly played a role of a leader of two road blocks, ordered a twelve years old boy to be executed, led a number of people to attack Tutsis on Kabuye’s hill between 21 to 25 April.
According to Jean Marie Vianney Rugemintwaza, a survivor of the genocide, Mbarushimana was involved in the genocide planning meetings with Elie Ndayambaje, the former Mayor of Muganza. He was very active even before the start of genocide in this area, he moved around on a motorcycle mobilising people to set up road blocks where many Tutsis were killed. Mbarishimana also plotted the killing of Rugemintwaza’s brother in-law, Paul Bideri, who was 10 years old. Bideri was shot dead by a policeman on Mbarushimana’s orders.
Another witness, Margarita Mujawamariya accused Mbarushimana of having been part of several Interahamwe militias that killed thousands of Tutsis at Kabuye Hill. Mbarushimana was among those who hurled grenades at her group, some shot at them before descending on them with machetes. She added that her group was forced back by the Interahamwe led by Mbarushimana when trying to flee to neighbouring Burundi.
Another genocide survivor, François Munyaneza said that Mbarushimana clearly expressed that the enemy were the Tutsis. Mbarushimana attended genocide planning meetings in Ndora, and gave instructions to local residents on how they will carry out the killings.
Mbarushimana was granted asylum under the false name of Emmanuel Kunda, and has been living in Denmark since 2001. He was handed a life sentence in absentia in Rwanda in 2008. He was arrested at his home in the Zealand region of Denmark in December 2010, and has been in the custody of Danish police since his arrest.
