Lieutenant Colonel Yayat Sudrajat was born in Cimahi, Indonesia on 15 June 1959. He has a military background. At the time the events occurred he was Commander of the Intelligence Service of the Indonesian Army in East Timor.
The accusations of criminal responsibility go back to the events which took place in East Timor in 1999.Around 1400 people were killed in the months leading up to a referendum on independence for the region, organised by the United Nations on 30 August 1999, and during the days following this vote . In addition, more than 250’000 people were transferred by force or fled to West Timor or Indonesia. A large number of people were also victims of other violations of human rights, notably of torture and rape. These crimes were carried out by the militia with the support and coordination of members of the armed forces, the police and the Indonesian Civilian Authorities in order to influence the outcome of the referendum and to upset adoption of the results of the referendum.
More precisely, from November 1998, Yayat Sudrajat was said to have actively participated in the campaign aimed at destabilising the referendum process. He was accused in particular of training, financing and arming the pro-Indonesian militia responsible for the massacres. Moreover, he was also reported to have been implicated in the attack against the church in Liquica on 6 April 1999, which resulted in the loss of at least 26 lives (and even up to 60 deaths, according to certain reports).
On 22 February 2003, Yayat Sudrajat, and seven other highly placed military and civilian individuals, were indicted by “The Serious Crimes Unit”, a body set up by the United Nations Transitional Administration of East Timor (UNTAET)
