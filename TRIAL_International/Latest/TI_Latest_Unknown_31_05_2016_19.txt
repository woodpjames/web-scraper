Pierre Oba was born in July 1953 in the district of Ollombo, in northern Congo. Pierre Oba was Chief of Security to President Sassou Nguesso, (during the one-party regime), and Director-General of the National Police. He became Minister of the Interior of Congo in 1997.
During the 1998-1999 internal armed conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), the governments of Congo and the DRC and the High Commissioner for Refugees reached an agreement aimed at facilitating the voluntary repatriation of Congolese civilians who had been forced into exile by the violence.
Between 5 and 14 May 1999, 6599 refugees from Kinshasa, voluntarily crossed the River Congo, towards Brazzaville Beach. These refugees were separated into groups: soldiers, women, and able-bodied men. The latter were taken out of the line and transferred to secret locations from which they disappeared.
