facts

In 1991, the unilateral declaration of independence by Croatia brought about a Serb rebellion which was aimed at regaining Croatian territory with the help of Belgrade. At the time, Sasa Radak was a member of the Vukovar Territorial Army and more specifically of a volunteer detachment of the regular Yugoslav Army called “Leva Supoderica”, one of the units of the Serb rebellion in Croatia.
The allegations pertain to the participation of Sasa Radak in the events at the Ovcara Farm, which took place on the night of 20 November 1991, close to Vukovar, and during which 192 Croatian prisoners of war were executed.
Sasa Radak was arrested in May 2005.
Three Serbian officers, Mile Mrksic, Miroslav Radic and Veselin Sljivancanin (See “related cases”) were tried for the same events before the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.
The office of the Prosecutor of the Belgrade District Court indicted Sasa Radak in April 2005 for criminal acts committed against prisoners of war in violation of national legislation, and for war crimes committed against prisoners of war in violation of the rules of international law of armed conflicts.
Radak was arrested in May 2005. His trial opened on 7 July 2005, before the Belgrade District Court.
