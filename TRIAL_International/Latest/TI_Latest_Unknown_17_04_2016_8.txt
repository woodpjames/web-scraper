In 1994, Manasse Bigwenzare was president of the Murambi county court (the former Byumba region), in the East of Rwanda. He was accused of contributing to the planning and organisation of the 1994 genocide. Supported by eleven witnesses, the French Collective of Civil Parties for Rwanda (CPCR) accused him of participating in the massacre of the Kiziguro parish and hospital on 11 April 1994 with the former magistrate Jean-Baptiste Gatete, and of leaving two of his kin to die at the Kwangire border. Gatete was sentenced to life imprisonment in 2011 for his involvement in the genocide.
On 31 December 2003, after having lived in France for a period of time, Bigwenzare was granted political refugee status. On 22 June 2010, he obtained French nationality. He currently lives in Bouffemont, near Paris, in a retirement home.
