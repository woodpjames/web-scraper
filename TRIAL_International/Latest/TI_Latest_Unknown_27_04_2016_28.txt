facts

Désiré “Dési” Bouterse was born on 13 October 1945. He then went to the Netherlands to undergo military training.
In 1980, five years after Suriname’s independence from the Netherlands, Bouterse rose to power by instigating a military coup d’état, and became President of the National Military Council. He established a military regime accused of being responsible for numerous human right violations.
In the night of 8 to 9 December 1982, 15 opponents to the military regime (lawyers, journalists, soldiers) were kidnapped and led to a military base where they allegedly were tortured and executed. These events are known as the “December murders”.
Bouterse was accused of being directly involved in those murders. The only survivor from this massacre, Fred Derby, confirmed Bouterse’s involvement. However he passed away in May 2001 before being able to testify in the proceedings.
In 1999, Bouterse was sentenced in abstentia by Dutch Courts to 11 years in prison for drug trafficking. An arrest warrant was issued against him, however Suriname refused to extradite Bouterse to the Netherlands.
On 19 July 2010, Bouterse is elected President of Suriname.
