facts

Isaac Kamali was born in 1949 in Nyabikenke in Rwanda. He is on the list of the alleged criminals who led the genocide against the Tutsis in 1994.
Originally of Rwandan nationality, he became a French citizen in 2002 after he received permission to enter France as a refugee. He is accused by the Rwandan government of genocide and crime against humanity. Rwanda wants him to answer charges concerning his presumed implication in the 1994 genocide in his commune of Nyabikenke (Giterama Prefecture) in the south of Rwanda.
Kamali was arrested on 22 June 2007 at the Paris airport of Roissy, Charles-de-Gaulle after being refused entry to the USA due to the fact that his name appeared as suspect 26 on an Interpol list of 93 persons wanted by Rwanda. It was during this attempt to enter the United States that he was intercepted by the American authorities and, given that he had French citizenship which he acquired in 2002, was sent back to France where he was arrested and placed in detention on 7 July 2007 to await his extradition hearings.
He is suspected by the Rwandan authorities of having contributed to genocide and crime against humanity in the Gitamara region. In addition he is suspected of having participated in and supervising of the massacres committed by the Interahamwe. He is the subject of an extradition request issued by Rwanda which was the very first case to be examined by the Paris Court of Appeal which, until then, had only reviewed cases put before it by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) in Arusha, Tanzania.
