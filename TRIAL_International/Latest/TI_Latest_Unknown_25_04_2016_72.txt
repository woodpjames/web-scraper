On 6 December 1991, Miodrag Jokic, together with Pavle Strugar and Vladimir Kovacevic, allegedly commanded the terrestrial, naval and airborne attack launched by the Yugoslav National Army (JNA) against the city of Dubrovnik in Croatia and its surrounding area. Soldiers under his command shelled the Old Town of Dubrovnik, a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage site, provoking the destruction of the 68.3% of its historic centre. Two civilians were killed and three more were injured in the bombardment.
