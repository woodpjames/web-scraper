facts

Nazif Mehmeti, also known as “Dini”, was born on 20 September 1961 in the village of Shajkofc, in Kosovo. He was Deputy Commander of the special KLA units on the territory of the Lab region. He was also Police Commander in the same territory during the Kosovo war.
It is alleged that between August 1998 and June 1999 Nazif Mehmeti aided and abetted Rrustem Mustafa and Latif Gashi to illegally imprison Kosovo Albanian citizens in the detention centre of Llapashtica. Mehmeti reportedly supervised the detention centres, whilst knowing that prisoners were detained in inhumane conditions which lacked basic sanitation. It is also alleged that the detainees under suspicion of collaboration with the Serb forces were subjected to beatings and torture to force them to confess acts of disloyalty to the KLA. Some are said to have died in custody. The illegal detention also deprived them of their right to a fair trial.
Sometime before April 1999, it is alleged that Nazif Mehmeti carried out Rrustem Mustafa’s order to kill five Kosovo Albanians detained in the Majac and Potok detention centres.
