Rosauro Martinez was born on 11 November 1950 in Chillán, Chile. He joined the Chilean army in 1970 and retired in 1987. Between 1989 and 1992 he was the mayor of Chillán and then elected as a member of the conservative National Renewal party in 1993 and re-elected a further four times, in 1997, 2001, 2005 and 2009.
During the dictatorship, Martinez was a member of Augusto Pinochet’s political police who hunted down and killed rebels and those who opposed the regime.
Martinez was accused of being behind the killing of three militants from the Revolutionary Left Movement (MIR): Prospero del Carmen Guzman Soto, Patricio Alejandro Calfuquir Hernandez and José Eduardo Monsalve Sandoval, which took place on 20 September 1981 in the region of Valdivia in the south of the country. He was, in fact, in charge of the military unit who committed these crimes.
