Facts

José Mardoqueo Ortiz Morales was born on 26 April 1962 in Guatemala.
In 1980, Morales joined the Special Counterinsurgency Force of the Guatemalan Army, also known as the “Kaibiles”. The group was tasked with conducting military actions against members of the Fuerzas Armadas Rebeldes (FAR), a left-wing rebel group active in Guatemala since the 1960s.
On 4 December 1982, Morales was deployed together with sixteen other members of the Kabiles to the airbase of Santa Elena, Petén, in order to conduct an operation against suspected rebels in the village of Las Dos Erres.
On the night between 6 and 7 December, the Kaibiles entered Las Dos Erres and began removing residents from their homes. During that night, 251 villagers were subjected to extreme violence, including of sexual nature, and killed. The bodies of more than 160 victims were found crammed inside a well.
In August 1988, Morales illegally entered the US and established himself in Maryland where he resided and legally worked for many years. He applied for and was granted Lawful Permanent Resident (LPR) in 1990.
On July 13, 2006, Morales sought US citizenship by submitting a naturalization application to the US Citizenship and Naturalization Services (CIS). On application and during a CIS official interview, Morales falsely claimed under oath that he was not a part of any group reportable to CIS, when, in fact, he was a member of the Kaibiles and sought to conceal his involvement with that military unit.
