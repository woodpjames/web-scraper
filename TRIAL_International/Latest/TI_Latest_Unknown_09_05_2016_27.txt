Marko Radić, also known as Maka, was born on 13 August 1959 in the settlement of Livać, in the Municipality of Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina. Of Croat ethnicity, he holds both Bosnian and Croatian citizenships. Radić served his military term in Obrenovac in 1981, then became a teacher.
On 20 September 1991, Radić joined the First Battalion of the Second Brigade of the Croatian Defence Council (HVO). He later became Commander of the Battalion, then Commander of the Ivan Stanić Ćićo Sabotage Unit.
During the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Radić and the forces under his command operated in the Bijelo Polje area, in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Radić participated in the establishment of the prison facility in the village of Vojno, in the Mostar Municipality of the Bijelo Polje area. Allegedly, Radić ordered the unlawful arrest and detention of more than 70 Bosniak women, children and elderly people. Radić, who had effective control over the prisoners, reportedly abused them both physically and mentally. Radić was accused, among other things, of having forced a woman detainee into sexual intercourse.
Allegedly, Bosniak men were also brought to Vojno and detained separately from the women, children and the elderly under Radić’s command. There, they were submitted to brutal, degrading and inhumane conditions of detention and subjected to daily beatings by guards and soldiers, which resulted in the death of a number of prisoners.
On 2 June 2006, Radić was arrested by the Bosnian State Investigation and Protection Agency. He was immediately remanded in custody.
