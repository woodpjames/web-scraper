facts

Charles Ryandikayo was born around 1961 in Musenyi, in the Gishyita commune of Kibuye prefecture, Rwanda. At the time of the allegations, he was manager of a restaurant in Mubuga in the Gishyita commune. Ryandikayo was accused of playing a preponderant role in the systematic extermination of the Tutsis in different places throughout the Kibuye prefecture in 1994.
Between 9 April and 30 June 1994, Ryandikayo is alleged to have been present at and to have participated in the massacre of Tutsis throughout the Kibuye prefecture.
By about 14 April 1994, thousands of Tutsi were congregated in the church in Mubuga -located 20 km from the town of Kibuye – seeking refuge from the attacks against them which had already taken place all over the Kibuye prefecture. Ryandikayo and others (notably Clément Kayishema and Charles Sikubwabo; see “related cases”) were said to have given the order to members of the National Gendarmerie, to the Communal Police of Gishyita, to the Interahamwe (an extremist Hutu militia), and to armed civilians to carry out an attack on the church. Furthermore, Ryandikayo was charged with having personally participated in this attack against the church in Mubuga between 14 and 16 April which resulted in the death of thousands of these refugees.
In July 1994, faced with the advance of the troops of the FPR (the Rwandan Patriotic Front, an opposition movement composed essentially of Tutsi refugees and led by Paul Kagame), Ryandikayo fled Rwanda most probably in the direction of the Democratic Republic of Congo. As of today’s date, he has still not been arrested.
