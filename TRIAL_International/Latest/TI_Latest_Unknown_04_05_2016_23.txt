facts

Paul Touvier was born in 1915. He joined the SOL – Service d’ordre legionnaire – and later the French Militia, from the very formation of these organisations in 1942 and 1943 respectively.
In April 1942, he was made secretary of the SOL in Chambéry. His duties included in particular establishing files on Resistance members. His policing skills were soon discovered, and he was put in charge of the Second Service of the Militia in Savoy. Touvier was then called to Lyon where he became regional leader of the Militia for ten departments, National Police Superintendant and, in January 1944, head of the state office for the Maintenance of Public Order. Politics and the political police brought Touvier social success, psychological satisfaction and material advantages. He infiltrated the Resistance, interrogated prisoners, carried out raids, pillaged and avenged the death of Henriot by having seven Jews shot dead in Rillieux-la-Pape on 29 June 1944.
From September 1944 onwards, Touviers went into hiding under a false identity (“Trichet”). He later re-adopted his real identity after the period of prescription for his crimes had lapsed in 1967.
He was not however to escape justice. He was accused of criminal actions constituting crimes against humanity, committed while carrying out his function as local leader of the Second Service of the Militia in Lyon. The criminal investigation concerned the following alleged facts (see decision of the Cour de Cassation from 1992, under ‘related links’):
1. Aggression committed on 10 December 1943 in the synagogue on Quai de Tilsitt in Lyon, in the course of which grenades were thrown, causing injuries to certain people
(complaint lodged by Rosa Eisner-Vogel)
2. The arrest of Jewish people in the same place, on 13 June 1944, who were subsequently deported and died in a concentration camp (complaint by Rosa Eisner-Vogel, Jacques and Laurent Darcueil and Nicole Heymann)
3. The arrest of Victor Basch and his wife née Hélène Furth, both Jewish, in Caluire on 10 January 1944 and their execution in Neyron (complaint by the Basch family)
4. The arrest of Jean de Filippis, Resistance member, on 16 January 1944 in Lyon, who was tortured and deported to a concentration camp by the occupying powers (complaint by Filippis)

6. The arrest of Albert Nathan in Lyon, on 9 May 1944, who was executed by the Germans on 17 August 1944 (complaint by Robert Nathan)
7. The raid in Montmélian, on 24 April 1944, in the course of which Alexandre Munoz-Rojo, José Lopez and Michel Charvier were arrested and later deported to a concentration camp where Charvier died (complaint by Georgette Charvier, Munoz-Rojo and Lopez)
8. The arrest of Emile Medina in Vaulx-en-Velin, on 19 May 1944, who was later tortured (complaint by Medina)

11. The arrest of Lucien Meyer, Eliette Meyer and Claude Bloch in Crépieux-les-Brosses, on 29 June 1944, killing of Lucien Meyer and deportation of the other two which led to the death of Eliette Meyer (complaint by Claude Bloch)
Paul Touvier was sentenced to death in absentia for treason by the Cour de Justice in Lyon in December 1946. The following year he was convicted of conspiring with the enemy by the Cour de Justice in Chambéry and again sentenced to death.
