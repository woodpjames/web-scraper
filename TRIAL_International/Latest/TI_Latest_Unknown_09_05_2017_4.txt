Facts

Ibro Merkez was born on 15 November 1942 in Foča, in Bosnia and Herzegovina. He was a former police commander in charge of the Public Security Station of Goražde between May and late August 1992. He was also member of the Presidency of the Goražde Municipal Assembly in the state of war.
During his period as police commander in 1992, Merkez, through his subordinates, allegedly detained Serb civilians, including children, in the Goražde police station and other buildings in the town, often in inhumane and unhygienic conditions, which caused them great physical and mental harm.
In particular, from July to late October 1992 approximately 70 civilians were held in custody in four different apartments located near the police station. While the police station was shelled in the summer of 1992, Merkez allegedly prohibited the detainees to take shelter in the basement of the building: as a result, one person was killed and three more wounded. Other 35 civilians were illegally detained in police buildings in Goražde from July 1992 to February 1993.
It has also been alleged that some detainees lost their lives for denial of medical assistance in custody: two died in the police station, four deceased right after their release, while one tried to commit suicide and died in hospital after this attempt.
