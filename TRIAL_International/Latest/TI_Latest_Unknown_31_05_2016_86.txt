Real Rights Now
31.05.2016
Introduction 
Real Rights Now is part of a wider campaign to push for implementation of the Views of Human Rights Committee relating to cases of gross human rights violations in Nepal.
In a collaborative effort to ensure victims receive the redress to which they are entitled under international law, the partner organisations of this campaign – Advocacy Forum, Juri-Nepal, REDRESS, and TRIAL – are working together on a number of different activities, in addition to Real Rights Now. These include trying to bring together relevant government officials to understand and define their responsibilities, arranging meetings between victims and government officials, media outreach, holding meetings to update the Human Rights Committee and publishing a policy paper on compensation.
As part of the campaign, this portal serves as a central point of reference – in both Nepali and English – on the decisions of the Human Rights Committee concerning Nepal, their implementation status, and planned actions to push for further progress and the realisation of victims’ rights.
