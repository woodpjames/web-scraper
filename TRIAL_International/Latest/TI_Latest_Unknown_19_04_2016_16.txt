Facts

Khieu Samphan was born on 27 July 1931 in Rumchek commune of Rumduol district, Cambodia.
In 1968, Samphan joined the Kampuchea Communist Party (CPK), which later became known as the ‘Angkor’ and its members known as the ‘Khmer Rouge’. In the following years, Samphan participated in the deliberations of CPK’s high-level decisional bodies such as the Central Committee and the Standing Committee.
On 17 April 1975, after several years of military conflict between the CPK forces and the governmental forces of the Khmer Republic, the CPK took control of Phnom Penh and created the state of Democratic Kampuchea. On 11 April 1976, Samphan was appointed as Democratic Kampuchea’s Head of State.
From 17 April 1975 to at least 6 January 1979, killings and episodes of extreme violence were committed throughout the territory of Cambodia against civilians, including members of the Cham and Vietnamese minorities, and enemy soldiers of the defeated Khmer Republic.  Notably, a significant portion of the entire Cambodian population was forcibly moved from urban to rural areas and forced to work in agricultural sites. During this period, nearly two million Cambodians were killed or died from diseases, starvation, execution, or exhaustion from overwork.
