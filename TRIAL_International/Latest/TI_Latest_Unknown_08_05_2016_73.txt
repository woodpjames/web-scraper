facts

Sylejman Selimi, also known by the nickname “Sultan”, was born in the village of Drenica, Kosovo. He became a commander of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) in the Drenica area of Kosovo between 1998 and 1999, and commanded the Kosovo Protection Corps from 2006 to 2009 and the Kosovo Security Force from 2009 to 2011, before becoming ambassador to Albania.
DRENICA GROUP CASE
The Drenica Group was allegedly a KLA wartime guerrilla cell, in which Selimi was suspected to have been involved. The Group is reported to have committed torture and mistreatment of detainees at the Kosovo Liberation Army headquarters in Likovc/Likovac (Skënderaj/Srbica municipality) in 1998 and 1999.
The Drenica Group reportedly abducted at least 30 Serb and 11 ethnic Albanian civilians, as well as several policemen, during attacks on towns and villages.
In September 1998, Selimi is alleged to have abused a prisoner referred to as ‘Witness A’ reportedly by beating him with fists and with sticks. He is also alleged to have ordered Witness B, another civilian held in the Likovc/Likovac detention centre, to repeatedly strike Witness A with a wooden plank, and pinched Witness A’s genitals with an iron tool, subsequently dragging him on the floor with it.
ALLEGED WAR CRIMES AGAINST FEMALE PRISONERS
Selimi, in his capacity of a high-ranking member of the KLA and together with other unidentified KLA members, was accused of repeatedly assaulting two ethnic Albanian women who were being held at a KLA detention centre in Likovc/Likovac during the conflict at the end of 1998 and the beginning of 1999.
