Miroslav Radic was born on 10 September 1962 in Zemun, Serbia. He was captain in the Yugoslav Peoples Army (JNA) and commanded a special infantry unit of the first battalion of the Elite Motorised Guards Brigade. In this capacity, he was reported to have taken part in the attack on Vukovar which took place from the end of August until 18 November 1991.
During this attack hundreds of civilians were killed by the Serbian forces and the vast majority of the non-Serbs still remaining were forced to leave. The accusations brought against Miroslav Radic concern more specifically the fate of the people who had taken refuge at Vukovar Hospital in the belief that it would be evacuated in the presence of international observers. On 20 November 1991, 400 of these people were led away by JNA soldiers. Miroslav Radic was said to have taken part personally in the removal and the selection of the detainees who were then loaded onto buses. The detainees were transported to the JNA barracks where they were said to have been humiliated and threatened. They were then transported to a farm where they were beaten up by soldiers. Afterwards the soldiers reportedly drove the detainees by groups of 10 to 20 people in the direction of Grabovo until reaching a ravine surrounded by forest. There, the soldiers allegedly killed at least 264 Croats and other non-Serbs taken from the Vukovar Hospital to Ovcara. After the massacre, the Serbian forces were reported to have buried the bodies of the victims at this same spot.
Miroslav Radic voluntarily surrendered on 15 May 2002 and was transferred on the same day to the ICTY (International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia).
