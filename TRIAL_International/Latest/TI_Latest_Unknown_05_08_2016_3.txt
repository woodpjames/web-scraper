Facts

Mohibur Rahman was born on 1 January 1950 in Kumurshan, in what is currently Bangladesh.
Mohibur Rahman, his brother Mojibur Rahman and his cousin Abdur Razzak were said to be strong followers of Syed Kamrul Ahsan, a local potential leader of Nejam-e-Islami, a pro-Pakistani political organisation. They allegedly sided against the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971 and joined the local Razakar, a paramilitary force organized by the Pakistan Army in East Pakistan during the Liberation War. The local Razakar Camp and torture cell was reportedly located in Syed Kamrul Ahsanâ€™s house, in the village of Khagaura.
According to the Prosecutor, the Rahman brothers and their cousin Razzak were involved in the following incidents:

One day in February or March 1971, with a group of Razakars, they captured a civilian and brought him to the Razakara Camp, where he was subjected to torture and physical assault that resulted in fracture of one of his hands. They detained him there for one day and one night.
On 26 October 1971, accompanied by a group of armed Razakars and Pakistani soldiers, they were accused of having launched an attack against a number of houses belonging to civilians of the Hindu community, causing great destruction by looting households and setting the houses on fire. On the same day, a number of the Pakistani soldiers were said to have raped two women in presence of the Rahman brothers and Razzak.
On 11 November 1971, accompanied by a group of armed Razakars, on Mohibur Rahman orders, the three accused allegedly raided the house of an independentist, resulting in the death of two civilians. They furthermore captured another civilian and took him to the Razakar Camp where he was subjected to torture.
