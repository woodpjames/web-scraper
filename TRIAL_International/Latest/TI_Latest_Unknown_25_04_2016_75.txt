facts

Goran Damjanovic was born on 12 July 1966 in Sarajevo, in Bosnia and Herzegovina. He is a Serb national and citizen of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
On 2 June 1992, Goran Damjanovic and his brother Zoran Damjanovic, both members of the Bosnian Serb Army (Army of Republika Srpska â€“ VRS), allegedly tortured approximately twenty to thirty Bosniak men who had been taken prisoners at a supermarket in the residential zone of Bojnik in Sarajevo. The victims had been captured on that same day by the Serbian military forces: some had been wounded, and others had surrendered. They were kicked and punched and subjected to beatings with firearms and clubs, in reprisal for having resisted the Serbian army during the attack on the residential zone of Ahatovici. The action was also allegedly motivated as a discriminatory retaliation against the victims because of their Bosniak nationality.
On 26 April 2006, day of Goran Damjanovic arrest, firearms and ammunitions illegally possessed were impounded at his residence.
