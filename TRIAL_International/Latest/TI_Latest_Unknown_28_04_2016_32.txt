facts

Ramón Genaro Díaz Bessone was born in Mendoza, Argentina, in 1925. He enters the military college in 1943. He is appointed governor of the Mendoza province then promoted to Commander of the Second Army Corps based in Rosario (Santa Fe province) from September 1975 till October 1976, in charge of six provinces and thus, their detention centres. General Videla appoints him minister of Planification. Bessone leaves the army in 1978.
In 1985, he is indicted for crimes committed in the Parana province but is freed thanks to the Final Point laws of 1987.
In 1989, president Menem grants pardon to most indicted army personnel, including Bessone.
In 1994, Bessone is elected president of the ‘Military Circle’ and re-elected in 1998 when he expels from the Circle general Martín Balza, ex-commander in chief of the Army who, in 1995, had criticized the Army conduct during the dictatorship.
In 2003, French journalist Marie-Monique Robin presents a documentary called « Death Squads, the French school » in which Bessone admits that the argentine military used techniques applied by the French army in Algeria, taught by French militaries in Buenos Aires in 1959. In the interview, he justifies the use of torture and admits that the Armed Forces choose to execute “around 7.000 people secretly so as to avoid criticism from the Pope”.
That same year, president Néstor Kirchner starts a procedure that will lead to the abrogation of the 1987 impunity laws. It is the beginning of numerous trials, including that of Bessone in June 2004 for crimes committed during the dictatorship.
In 2007, he is indicted for the disappearance of a woman opponent but is freed by a Court of Appeal in accordance with a longer than reasonable time of preventive detention. This will be cancelled by a superior court.
In 2010, Bessone and five policemen are put on trial for the illegal arrest and torture of 93 opponents, 17 of which are still disappeared.
