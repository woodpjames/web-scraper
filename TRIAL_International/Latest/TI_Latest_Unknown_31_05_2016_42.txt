facts

Vincent Ntezimana was born in September 1961, in Murambi.
He became President of the Association of Academic Personnel at the University of Butare. Many employees of the university beseeched him to organise their evacuation following the outburst of the Rwandan genocide. For that purpose, and with the agreement of the Vice-Principle, he allegedly drew up three lists indicating the names of those persons who wished to escape. One of the lists contained only the names of Tutsis who wanted to get to Burundi. He handed over this list to the Vice-Principal, who later was to be designated as one of the principal persons responsible for the death of numerous personnel from the university. In addition, Ntezimana was said to have hindered individual escapes by a few families by giving them assurances that they would be able to take advantage of a collective evacuation organised under the auspices of the university.
Ntezimana was also accused of complicity in the murder of five members of the Karenzi family. He was said to have done so by giving his agreement by telephone to the murder of the wife and children of one of his colleagues at the university.
Furthermore, Ntezimana reportedly did not intervene when one of his employees killed a badly wounded young woman in his garden where she had tried to hide. He also allegedly participated in the murder of a young man by handing him out a beating just before the same employee battered him to death with the butt of a rifle.
He was also accused of reporting a woman and her young child to the military. The woman and the child were killed soon afterwards.
After the genocide, Ntezimana left Rwanda and asked for asylum in Belgium.
Vincent Ntezimana was arrested on 27 April 1995 at his Belgian residence and placed in temporary detention.
