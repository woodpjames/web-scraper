Facts

Colonel Yusuf Abdi Ali, also called Tukeh, is a Somali native and a resident of the United States.
 In 1984, Abdi Ali and his soldiers allegedly terrorized the dominant Isaaq population by arbitrarily detaining individuals and subjecting them to torture and cruel and inhuman treatment, including starvation and beatings, and summary executions. They allegedly also burned homes, looted the wealth of dwellers and ransacked livestock. Abdi Ali is alleged to have personally participated in many instances of torture and summary executions.
In December 1997, soldiers under Abdi Ali’s command arrested a 16-year-old boy, Farhan Mohamoud Tani Warfaa, a native and resident of north-western Somalia, along with several other men. They were then imprisoned. During his detention at the Fifth Brigade Army headquarters in Gebiley, which lasted approximately three months, Warfaa is said to have been tortured and interrogated on numerous instances, including by Abdi Ali himself.
Warfaa was finally freed by Abdi Ali’s soldiers who secretly agreed to release him in exchange for a payment from Warfaa’s family.
Abdi Ali is also accused to have disarmed Isaaq soldiers under his command in June 1988 and to have sent them to Hargeisa to be executed as a part of the mass execution of Isaaq people taking place there at that time.
Abdi Ali fled to Canada and applied for asylum. However, in October 1992, he was deported when evidence of his alleged brutality emerged. In 1993, he went to the US, where he filed for permanent residency. Despite facing deportation in 1994, in 1996 he was permitted to return to the US where he has lived openly ever since.
