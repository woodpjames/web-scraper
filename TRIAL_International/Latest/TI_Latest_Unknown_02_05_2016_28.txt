facts

Born on 4 October 1903 in Austria, Ernst Kaltenbrunner studied law and became a lawyer. He joined the Nazi party in the early thirties and became a member of the SS.
Kaltenbrunner was a strong proponent of the Anschluss, the annexation of Austria into the German Reich. Indeed he later became a member of the German parliament, and occupied several positions of authority.
It was after the assassination of Rheinhard Heydrich, the head of the Reich’s Security Service (Reichssicherheitshauptamt, RSHA), that Kaltenbrunner took over his most important functions. As the new head of the RSHA, he reported directly to Himmler.
Kaltenbrunner was accused of having taken advantage of his different functions and his personal influence in order to promote the consolidation of control over Austria after annexation by the Nazi conspirators as set forth in count 1 of the indictment. Moreover Kaltenbrunner authorized, directed and participated in the war crimes, set forth in count 3 of the indictment, and in crimes against humanity, set forth in count 4 of the indictment, in particular with respect to the atrocities committed in the concentration camps.
By way of example, Kaltenbrunner was accused of having given the order to execute all of the prisoners in the Matthausen camp. The commandant of the Auschwitz camp, Rudolph Hoess specifically stated that “all the mass executions in the gas chambers took place under the direct orders, the supervision and the overall responsibility of the RSHA. I received orders directly from the RSHA to proceed with these mass executions.”
Kaltenbrunner was arrested on 15 May 1945.
