Facts

Carlos Vielmann Montes was born in 1956. He was a Guatemalan politician and Minister of Domestic Affairs of Guatemala between 2004 and 2007, when he resigned following scandals for extrajudicial executions ascribed to the police. He then moved to Spain, where he was granted Spanish citizenship in 2009.
During his mandate, several murders of detainees occurred at the hands of the police and paramilitary forces under the alleged direct responsibility of Erwin Sperisen, who Vielmann himself had appointed Chief of the National Civil Police (PNC). Ten prisoners have allegedly been summarily executed during two operations to recapture fugitives and quell prison riots:

In October 2005, after 19 inmates had escaped from the high-security compound of the Infiernito prison, officials of the PNC put in place the “Plan Gavilán”, to track down and execute the escapees and cover up the crime. Three escapees were reportedly murdered. The crime scene was later allegedly altered to hide the disproportionate use of force.


On 25 September 2006, an operation to regain control of the Pavón prison, taken over by a group of criminals, mobilized 3’000 policemen, members of the military and penitentiary officials. During the operation, 7 prisoners were executed and the crime scene was allegedly camouflaged to give the impression of individual fights resulting in inevitable casualties. Vielmann had allegedly authorised the operation, was himself on the crime scene and was constantly updated on the phone.
