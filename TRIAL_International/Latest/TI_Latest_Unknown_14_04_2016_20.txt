facts

Raúl Lucio Gerard Pedernera was born on 9 September 1925 in Buenos Aires. On 4 March 1974, Pedernera retired from the army where he held the position of Colonel.
On 8 October 1975, Perdenera was appointed as Head of Police in Río Negro by the constitutional governor. Pedernera played an active role in the “Condor Plan”, under which Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay – all then ruled by dictators – coordinated efforts to enforce the disappearance of and regularly torture political opponents. The Condor Plan operated in three main areas: political vigilance of dissident refugees and exiles; secret counter-insurrectional activities; and joint extermination activities.
On 2 April 1976, Daniel Orlando Avalos and Carlos Apolinario Lima were kidnapped in Sierra Grande in the Rio Negro province. Avalos was secretary general of the Sierra Grande branch office of the “Unión Obrera de la Construcción de la República Argentina” (the Argentinean Building Workers’ Union) while Lima collaborated with Avalos. In 1975, they participated in a prolonged strike at the Hipasam mining complex. Following these events, Avalos was arrested at his home. Lima went to the police voluntarily, and was arrested and tortured. On 5 April 1976, both were transferred to a police cell in Viedma. There, Avalos and Lima were allegedly interrogated and tortured for a month. Avalos was released on 20 April 1976 and Lima later that year, on 5 July.
Pedernera supposedly knew what was happening in the Rio Negro province in the fight against subversion and as head of the provincial police force, he is alleged to have used all the material means and all the necessary personnel within his power to help the repression.
