Christian: Kidnapped, reported missing, and eventually executed
20.09.2018
In December 2015, in Burundi, unidentified armed individuals carried out attacks on four military bases, in and around Bujumbura.
Following these attacks, the law enforcement authorities conducted an unprecedented repressive campaign in several opposition-affiliated neighborhoods. According to certain estimates, approximately 160 people were reportedly killed and many people were victims of arbitrary arrests, torture and rape.
The day after the attacks, Christian (real name withheld) was arrested by a group of police officers and forcibly taken into a NIS (National Intelligence Service) van.
A few days later, Christianâ€™s lifeless body was found. His remains showed numerous marks of abuse and several bullet holes.
