Marinko Ljepoja was born on 20 May 1966 in Suhaca (municipality of Bosanski Novi). During the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, he was a member of the Serbian special police unit “Intervention Squad”.
In August 1992, while an armed conflict was taking place between Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (later Serbia and Montenegro) and Croatia on the territory of in Bosnia and Herzegovina, a widespread and systematic attack was launched by the Bosnian Serb military, paramilitary and police forces against the non-Serb civilian population of the municipality of Prijedor.
Marinko Ljepoja is accused of having taken part in an event that took place on 21 August 1992. It is alleged that on that day, a group of non-Serb prisoners, detained in the Trnopolje concentration camp, were informed that they would be “exchanged” against Serbian prisoners and transported to Travnik. That same morning, several hundreds – perhaps over a thousand – civilian men, women and children gathered in the village of Tukovi. They had been told that a convoy would be organized that day to Travnik. It is alleged that the convoy transporting the non-Serb men stopped along the way at a location called Koricanske Stijene, and the detainees were ordered to leave the buses with their heads down, and to kneel at the edge of a cliff. The police then allegedly started firing at the men. Apart from twelve persons who survived the massacre, it is estimated that more than 200 men were killed.
On 7 September 2009, Marinko Ljpepoja was arrested by the State Investigation and Protection Agency (SIPA).
