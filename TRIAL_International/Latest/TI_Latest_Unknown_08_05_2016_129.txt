facts 


Armin Cruz was born in Texas in 1980 and joined the US army as a reservist. During the Iraq war in 2003/2004, he was a member of the 205th intelligence unit.
In late 2003, rumours started circulating that members of the US army had been mistreating and torturing Iraqi detainees in Abu Ghraib prison. In January 2004, Joseph Darby, a member of the US military police, informed the army leadership about these abuses and supplied the officer in charge with photographic material. The pictures documented scenes in which naked Iraqi detainees were being beaten and forced to simulate sexual acts.
At the end of January 2004, the commander-in-chief of the multinational troops in Iraq, General Ricardo Sanchez, instructed General Antonio Taguba to set up an inquiry into the affair. The findings of his investigation were handed over to the authorities in charge on 4 April 2004.
The so-called Taguba report (see ‘links’) concluded that American soldiers carried out acts of humiliation which severely violated international law. It stated that numerous ‘sadistic abuses’ were inflicted upon detainees of Abu Ghraib between October and December 2003. The guards had set up their own rules, which were condoned more or less explicitly by their superiors.
The report cited numerous examples of maltreatment towards detainees, such as physical and sexual abuse, torture, intimidation by the use of military dogs and the threat of rape and killing.
As an intelligence operative, Cruz was in charge of collecting and analyzing information obtained from interrogations of detainees, but his presence at the interrogations was not required. However, it was reported that Cruz often participated in them, sometimes actively. He was charged with forcing naked detainees to simulate sexual acts and to carry out other degrading actions.
Armin Cruz was indicted by the US army.
