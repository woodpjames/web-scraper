01.01.2016
In March 2015 TRIAL and 8 associations from Mexico and Central America submitted a follow-up report to the United Nations Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances (WGEID) on the level of implementation of the recommendations formulated by the latter in 2011, on the occasion of its visit to Mexico.
In January 2016 TRIAL, the Fundación para la Justicia y el Estado democrático de derecho and two associations of relatives of disappeared persons from El Salvador and Honduras submitted a report to the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances (WGEID) on the obstacles faced by relatives of disappeared migrants in the struggle for justice, truth and reparations. The report aims at illustrating the unique challenges faced by migrants and their relatives, in view of the thematic study on “disappearances in the context of migrations” that the WGEID is currently drafting.
