Clarification in the Nezzar case
09.11.2011
Following various assertions published in the media in connection with the Khaled Nezzar case, TRIAL wishes to clarify the following:
1. TRIAL (Swiss association against impunity) is an independent, apolitical and non-confessional organisation and has consultative status before the United Nations Economic and Social Council. The main objective of TRIAL is to put the law at the service of the victims of international crimes (genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, torture and enforced disappearances).
In this sense, TRIAL fights against the impunity of the perpetrators and instigators of the most serious international crimes and their accomplices and defends the interests of the victims (whoever they are) before Swiss tribunals, international human rights organisms and the International Criminal Court.
Contrary to what has sometimes been stated, TRIAL does not side with any faction, party or State: it initiates proceedings against individuals suspected of serious violations of human rights, without discrimination. Its only purpose is to defend victims of the most heinous crimes.
The organisation does not answer to the CIA or Islamist networks and is not a member of any Masonic Lodge, as it has sometimes been asserted.
TRIAL reserves the right to take any legal action in case of defamatory statements.
2. At this stage, only two criminal complaints and a denunciation have been filed in the Khaled Nezzar case.
TRIAL challenges any assertion to the contrary.
3. TRIAL has a clear and transparent communication. The organization regrets that several articles and reports containing erroneous facts in connection with the case have been published by certain media without prior consultation.
TRIAL remains available to journalists who wish to check and validate information.
