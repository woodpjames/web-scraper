facts

Erwin Sperisen, a Swiss and Guatemalan national, was born on 27 June 1970 in Guatemala.
On 22 July 2004, Sperisen was elected as Chief of the National Civil Police (PNC) in Guatemala City, a position he maintained until his resignation on 26 March 2007.
After having resigned from his position, Sperisen established himself in Geneva, Switzerland.
During his mandate as PNC’s Chief, Sperisen was entrusted with directing and running the national law enforcement corps of Guatemala.
After the escape of 19 dangerous prisoners from the high security prison of Infiernito in Guatemala City, on 22 October 2005, the Guatemalan security apparatus implemented a plan to locate and arrest the escaped prisoners (the Gavilan Plan). In furtherance of the Gavilan Plan, nine prisoners were captured and three prisoners allegedly killed. After the events, the crime scene was allegedly manipulated to make the murders look like resulting from a confrontation.
On 25 September 2006, the Guatemalan police carried out an operation aimed at re-establishing police’s control over the Pavón detention centre in the outskirts of Guatemala City, which was for a long time ruled by some of the criminals detained in the prison. During the operation, which mobilised officials of the PNC, the penitentiary authorities and the army, seven prisoners were arrested and killed. Signs of crime scene manipulation were found.
