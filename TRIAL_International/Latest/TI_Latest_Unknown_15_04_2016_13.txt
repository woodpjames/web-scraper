Julián Acoj Morales, born in Guatemala between 1955 y 1956, was a member of the Civil Defence Patrols (Patrullas de Autodefensa Civil, PAC) created in 1982 by the former dictator Efraín Ríos Montt aimed at maintaining control over rural areas of Guatemala.
The town of Rabinal and surrounding villages were frequently visited by the army and by paramilitary groups in order to search for insurgents and their supporters.
On 18 July 1982 the Maya hamlet of Plan de Sanchez, close to Rabinal, was surrounded by around 60 men in uniforms, allegedly members of the armed forces and of the PAC programme. On that day the village was full of people from other local communities, having come for the weekly market.
Once the men had entered the village, girls and women were separated from the rest of the people, raped, tortured and eventually killed. The rest of the villagers were forced into a house, which was then targeted with grenades. Finally the perpetrators set the house on fire with gasoline. The massacre resulted in 256 deaths, including of women and children.
In 1992 ten survivors of the ‘Plan de Sanchez’ massacre lodged a complaint in Guatemala for the damages suffered in the event. After evidence of the massacre was found in some mass graves in the region, in 1996 the Human Rights Ombudsman’s Office in Guatemala released a report indicating the responsibility of State agents for the events in Plan de Sanchez.
