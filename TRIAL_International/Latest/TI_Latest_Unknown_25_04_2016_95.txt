facts

Dusko Sikirica, alias Sikira, was born on 23 March 1964 in the Prijedor municipality of Bosnia-Herzegovina. At the time of the events in question, he was the Commander of the Keraterm prison camp. The Trial Chamber of the ICTY found, however, that even though he happened to carry out certain administrative functions from time to time, he had no effective role in the overall administration of the camp.
Dusko Sikirica was indicted for crimes against the non-Serbian population of the Prijedor municipality in the Keraterm camp committed during a period stretching from 24 May 1992 to around 5 August 1992.
The detainees were notably subjected to inhumane living conditions. Among these conditions for example, were lack of food and water, lack of medical care overcrowding, limited opportunities to have fresh air and exercise, as well as the absence of adequate toilet facilities. Moreover murder, physical abuse, rape, sexual assault, and various other forms of physical and psychological abuse were common practice in this camp. Of particular note, Dusko Sikirica confessed to the murder of one of the camp detainees, whom he killed with a bullet to the head.
Dusko Sikirica was arrested on the 25 June 2000 by the NATO soldiers in Bosnia- Herzegovina and transferred on that same day to the ICTY (International Criminal Tribunal for ex-Yugoslavia).
