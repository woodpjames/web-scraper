facts 

Darko Jankovic was born on 12 May 1972 in Kraljevo. He graduated from a secondary school for traffic engineering. He is married and father of two children.
The acts he is accused of were allegedly committed during the armed conflict in Bosnia Herzegovina between 1992 and 1995 in his capacity as a member of the Pivarski unit which was part of the Zvornik Territorial Defence and the overall Serbian armed forces.
Between 10 and 11 June 1992, Jankovic allegedly made several unauthorised entries into the Cultural Centre in Čelopek, where 162 Muslims from the village Divić were unlawfully held as hostages between 5 June and mid June 1992. Jankovic allegedly entered the centre and forced several inmates, in particular fathers and their sons, to undress and perform oral sexual intercourse with each other while, other detainees were forced to watch them. In addition, Jankovic is claimed to have entered the Cultural Centre on 13 June 1992 mutilating some detainees and forcing them to eat their removed body parts.
Between 12 May and late July 1992, around 20 Muslim civilians who had been detained in the farm Ekonomija were transferred to a site known as the Brickyard, where Darko Jankovic engaged in acts of inhumane treatment against the detained civilians.
It is argued that Jankovic has killed 19 civilians by stabbing them with a knife or slitting their throats.
Jankovic was arrested by the Serbian police on 4 January 2010.
