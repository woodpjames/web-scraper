facts

Roberto Eduardo Viola was born on 13 October 1924. He took up a military career and was appointed Commander in Chief of the Argentine Army in 1975. He was a fervent supporter of the 1976 coup d’état and was promoted to the rank of Brigadier General in 1977 and then to Commander in Chief with the rank of Lieutenant General.
He replaced Videla as the Head of State on 29 March 1981, but was himself ousted from power by General Galtieri on 11 December 1981.
During the years of dictatorship, in what was later to be termed the “dirty war” (1976-1983), the Argentine military resolved to eradicate what successive juntas called “subversive thoughts” as well as “terrorists”, namely “anyone who disseminated ideas contrary to Western Christian civilisation”. During the years that followed, the military murdered or forcibly “disappeared” from 10’000 to 30’000 people. In addition, some 500’000 opponents of the regime found themselves forced into exile to escape from its repression.
Several hundred secret detention centres were set up throughout the country. Torture was practised systematically in these centres. Also in these places numerous prisoners were murdered or disappeared. Young women prisoners who gave birth there had their children taken away from them and placed in military families after falsification of the relevant documents.
In the course of 1983, the military regime, weakened by its resounding defeat by the British navy in the Falklands war, gave way to a democratically elected civilian government with the Radical, Raul Alfonsin,as its President.
After the fall of the military junta, Roberto Eduardo Viola, together with others in positions of responsibility during the dictatorship, was indicted and put on trial.
