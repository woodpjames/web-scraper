Salim Jamil Ayyash was born on 10 November 1963. He was Hezbollah’s southern military commander and a veteran of Hezbollah’s war with Israel in 2006. He holds a U.S. passport and is a volunteer with Lebanon’s Civil Defense.
On 14 February 2005, Rafik Hariri, former Prime Minister of Lebanon, was assassinated as a result of a terrorist act in which a suicide bomber detonated explosives in Beirut. The explosion killed Hariri and 21 other persons and injured 231 persons. At that time, Hariri was a Member of Parliament. After the explosion, AI-Jazeera in Beirut received a video on which a man claimed to be the suicide bomber and a member of a fictional fundamentalist group called “Victory and Jihad in Greater Syria”.
The investigation using communications analysis, witness statements and documentary evidence, identified four persons among others who played a role in that terrorist act. The investigators identified Salim Jamil Ayyash, Mustafa Amine Badreddine, Hussein Hassan Oneissi and Assad Hassan Sabra.
Salim Ayyash is suspected in particular of leading the team which executed the assassination of Hariri.
