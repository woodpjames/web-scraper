Zlatko Aleksovski was born on 8 January 1960 in Pakrac, Croatia.
In 1993 Zlatko Aleksovski was commander of the prison facility at Kaonik, near Busovaca, Bosnia Herzegovina. He was in charge of Kaonik Prison and was in a position of superiority to everyone else in the camp. After May 1993, he left Kaonik to become the Head of the prison «Heliodrom» of the Croatian Defence Council («HVO»), in Mostar.
From January 1993 until the end of May 1993, Zlatko Aleksovski accepted the internment of hundreds of Muslim civilians at the detention centre of Kaonik. Many of the detained under his control were said to have been subjected to inhumane treatment, including, but not limited to, excessive and cruel interrogation, physical and psychological violence, exposure to forced labour under dangerous conditions and being used as human shields. Some were murdered or otherwise killed.
Zlatko Aleksovski was arrested by Croatian authorities in Split on 8 June 1996 and was transferred to the ICTY on 28 April 1997.
