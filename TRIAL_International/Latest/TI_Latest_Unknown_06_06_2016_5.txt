Torn away from his family and deprived of a dignified funeral
06.06.2016
Jules (not his real name), married with four children, was a long-standing member of the National Liberation Front (FNL), an opposition party.
In 2010, a post-election crisis swept across the country, resulting in a deterioration of the safety of political opponents and a surge in extrajudicial executions.
That was when Jules began to be persecuted and threatened by the Burundian national police and intelligence services.
These intimidations amplified until 2012 when, fearing for his life, Jules was forced to go into hiding. Despite these precautions, that very year he fell into a trap set by an old friend and was abducted, tortured, and finally executed.
His decapitated body was found bearing signs of torture. His family did not get a chance to see his remains or even to organize a dignified funeral for him.
