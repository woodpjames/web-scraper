facts 

Jean-Bosco Barayagwiza was born in 1950 in Mutura commune, Gisenyi prefecture, Rwanda. He was a founding member of the Coalition for the Defense of the Republic (CDR) and the Mille Collines Free Radio and Television (RTLM) during the course of the events in question.
As a member of the CDR, Barayagwiza allegedly conducted several meetings to plan the execution of Tutsis and some moderate Hutus in the commune of Mutura. He distributed arms and money to militia, provoking and ordering the execution and violence against Tutsis and moderate Hutus. He knew or had access to information that the members of the CDR killed or committed other acts of violence against Tutsis and moderate Hutus, without taking the necessary and reasonable measures to prevent this from happening.
In addition, together with Ferdinand Nahimana, Félicien Kabuga and others, Barayagwiza created the Mille Collines Free Radio and Television (RTLM) to promote the extremist Hutu ideology. In November 1993 and then in February 1994, Barayagwiza was summoned to the Ministry of Information of Rwanda where he was ordered, among other things, to stop spreading messages that incite ethnic hatred and inter-ethnic division. However, the RTLM continued to broadcast its provocative programmes until the end of July 1994.
Furthermore, during his exile in Cameroon in 1995, Barayagwiza published a book titled “Is Hutu blood red?” exposing his anti-Tutsi political views.
Barayagwiza was arrested and detained in the Republic of Cameroon at the request of the Rwandan authorities in 1996. However, the prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) brought no charges against him at the time. Subsequently, on 21 February 1997 the Court of Appeal of Cameroon in Yaoundé rejected the Rwandan Government’s request for extradition of Barayagwiza.
