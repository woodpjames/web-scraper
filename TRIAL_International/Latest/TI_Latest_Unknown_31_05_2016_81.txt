facts

Major-General Zacky Anwar Makarim was born on 14 April 1948 in Jakarta. He came from a military background and, of note, served in East Timor and Irian Jaya in the course of his career. In 1997, he was appointed Director of the Intelligence Service of the Indonesian Army. He held this position until 1999.
The accusations of criminal responsibility against him go back to the events which took place in East Timor in 1999.
Around 1’400 people were killed in the months leading up to a referendum on independence for the region, organised by the United Nations on 30 August 1999, and during the days following this vote. In addition, more than 250’000 people were transferred by force or fled to West Timor or Indonesia. A large number of people were also victims of other violations of human rights, notably of torture and rape.
These crimes were carried out by the militia with the support and coordination of members of the armed forces, the police and the Indonesian Civilian Authorities in order to influence the outcome of the referendum and to put off adoption of the results of the referendum.
Although he did not hold an official position at the time of these events, Zacky Anwar Makarim nevertheless wielded decisive power. It was he that General Wiranto was said to have entrusted with the organisation of the overall campaign to destabilize the referendum procedure.
He was reported to have planned the whole operation and to have incited and armed those groupings favourably inclined to Indonesia. Moreover, he was said to have ensured the coordination between the regional authorities and the authorities in Jakarta.
On 22 February 2003 Zacky Anwar Makarim together with seven other high placed military and civilian personalities, were indicted by the Serious Crimes Unit, a body set up by the United Nations Transitional Administration of East Timor (UNTAET).
