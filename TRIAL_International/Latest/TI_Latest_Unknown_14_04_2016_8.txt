Zbigniew Siemiątkowski was born on 8 October 1957 in Ciechanow, Poland. He studied at the University of Warsaw, completing a Masters degree in Political Science in 1981 and a Doctorate degree in 1987. From 1981 to 1991, Siemiątkowski worked in the Department of Journalism and Politics at the University of Warsaw. Already in 1978, he became a member of the communist Polish United Workers’ Party (PZPR) and its successors-Social Democracy of the Republic of Poland (SdRP) and Democratic Left Alliance (SLD). On 7 February 1996, Siemiątkowski was appointed Minister of Internal Affairs and served in this position until 1997. From 2001 to 2002 he held the position of the Secretary of State. In 2002, Siemiątkowski was appointed Chief of the Polish Intelligence Agency (Agencja Wywiadu), the position he held until his resignation in April 2004.
The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in cooperation with the Polish Intelligence Agency, is supposed to have used the Polish army base in Stare Kiekuty, 180 km North of Warsaw, as a secret detention facility for high-value Al-Qaeda suspects between December 2002 and September 2003, the time when Siemiątkowski was at the head of the Polish Intelligence Agency. He allegdly signed an agreement between the CIA and the Polish intelligence service, which shows a local contractor was to build a cage that was to be used for torture purposes at Stare Kiekuty. Siematkowski claimed that if his signature was on the document, it was classified and he was not allowed to speak about it. Consequently, Siemiątkowski refused to confirm the existence of the document.
In 2008, Polish prosecutors opened an investigation concerning the secret detention site in Stare Kiekuty.
