On 15 January 2009 during Operation Cast Lead led by the Israeli Defence Forces against Hamas in Gaza, Staff Sgt. A. and Staff Sgt. H., two Israeli soldiers whose identities have not been made public who served in the Givati Brigadeâ€™s elite Reconnaissance Battalion, ordered a 9 year-old Palestinian boy, Majeh Rabah to open a number of bags suspected of containing explosives. The bags were found in a building located in the neighbourhood of Tel al-Hawa, south of Gaza City. The boy opened a number of bags and spread out their contents, and when he feared opening the last one, they removed him from the vicinity and fired at it. No explosives were found. He was then returned to his mother.
The Palestine section of Defence for Children International (DCI), filed a complaint before Israeli military authorities on behalf of Majeh Rabah in April 2009.
