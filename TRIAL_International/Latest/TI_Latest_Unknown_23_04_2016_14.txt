facts

Sixty five year old Rafael Francisco Ahumada Valderrama from Argentina is a former officer of the artillery Regiment of Tacna in the Chilean army. He was involved in acts of torture and forced disappearances during the dictatorship of General Augusto Pinochet (1973-1990), leaving thousands of victims, many of whom were French, including Georges Klein.
Ahumada Valderrama was an advisor to President Salvador Allende. It was confirmed that, on the morning of 11 September 1973, the day of the coup d’état, Georges Klein was found at the bombed presidential palace, La Moneda. Around 2 o’clock in the afternoon, he was taken as a prisoner along with approximately forty of President Allende’s staff by members of the Chilean army. These prisoners were driven to the Tacna Regiment. On 12 September 1973, the 16 police officers that were among the prisoners were freed. The following day, at around 2 o’clock in the afternoon, Georges Klein and the other prisoners that remained in detention were tied up and locked away in a dumper truck. They were then driven to the Peldehue firing ranges. Here, following the orders of Rafael Ahumada, they were forced to dig their own graves before being killed with machine guns.
There were no legal proceedings following the disappearance of Georges Klein, nor after the disappearances of several other victims of the Chilean dictatorship, until the arrest of General Augusto Pinochet on 16 October 1998 in London. This arrest was carried out in compliance with an international arrest warrant issued by the Spanish judge, Baltasar Garzón. The families of nine French victims sought justice from this country, which began legal proceedings against Rafael Francisco Ahumada Valderrama and 18 Chileans.
