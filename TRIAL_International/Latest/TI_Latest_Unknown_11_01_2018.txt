Facts

Gambia was under the control of Yahya Jammeh from 1994 to 2017. For more than two decades, all opposition was brutally repressed: torture, extrajudicial executions and enforced disappearances were widespread.
Ousman Sonko was commander of the Presidential Guard (elite corps), then a member of the Gambian army. He was finally the Inspector General of Police.
After the re-election of Yahya Jammeh in September 2006, Ousman Sonko was appointed Minister of Interior. He held this position until September 2016, when he was dismissed from office and left Gambia.
