facts

Kingoro Hashimoto was born in 1890 in Okayama, Japan. He became an officer in the Imperial Japanese Army and Chief of the Japanese Special Service in Manchuria.
Throughout the period between 1 January 1928 and 2 September 1945, Hashimoto, as a military leader, is reported to have played a pivotal role in the formulation and execution of a common plan leading Japan to wage wars of aggression to secure its domination of East Asia and the Pacific and Indian Oceans. With that purpose, Hashimoto allegedly participated in the March and October 1931 failed coups to establish a military dictatorship and in the 1932 plot to assassinate Prime Minister Inukai. He repeatedly expressed his public support for a policy of conquest and military expansion and was the founder of several radical right-wing societies within the army.
Hashimoto is also said to have plotted the military seizure of Manchuria by participating in the planning of the Mukden incident of 18 September 1931, which provided the pretext for the annexation of the region by Japan a few months later. In that occasion, Japanese militaries orchestrated a fake sabotage to a Japanese railway line in north-eastern China, which was later attributed by the Imperial Army of Japan to Chinese dissident and assumed as justification to invade China. Therefore, Hashimoto was allegedly the major instigator of the second Sino-Japanese war and acted as a commander in the field during the military campaign.
In 1944, Kingoro Hashimoto was elected to the Chamber of Representatives. A few months later, he became Vice-President of the Diet, the Japanese Parliament.
