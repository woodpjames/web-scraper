facts 

Klaas Carel Faber was born on 20 January 1922 in Haarlem, North Holland. He is the son of Pieter Faber who was a baker at Heemstede and Carolina Josephine Henriëtte Bakker, and the brother of Pieter Johan Faber who was executed for war crimes in 1948 in the Netherlands. Klaas Carel Faber settled down in the Bavarian town of Ingolstadt in 1957 with his wife Jacoba and worked for Audi as an office clerk. He has three children.
Like his brother, Faber joined the Dutch SS (Protection Squadron) soon after the German occupation of the Netherlands and worked for the SD (Nazi Security Service), particularly in the northern part of the Netherlands, being based at the SD-headquarters for this region at the Scholtenhuis in Groningen.
Afterwards Faber became a member of a death squad, the Sonderkommando Feldmeijer that was responsible for the codenamed “Operation Silbertanne” (silver fir). The death squad was supposed to murder civilians who were presumably connected to the resistance, who hid Jews or who were orange-minded.
After Operation Silbertanne was cancelled in the autumn of 1944, Faber was briefly part of the bodyguard of the leader of the Nationalist Socialist Movement (NSB), Anton Mussert, and reportedly participated in raids by the SS and SD in Groningen, where he allegedly mistreated and executed hostages and members of the resistance. He and his brother were also reportedly part of a firing squad in Westerbork concentration camp, where teenage diarist Anne Frank was held. Both brothers were actively involved in the execution of several dozens of detainees in the woods surrounding Exloo, Westerbork and Norg.
After the war, Klaas Carel Faber and his brother were tried by a Dutch court and sentenced to death by firing squad in June 1947 for the murder of at least 22 persons during the war, but during his trial the court held that he personally carried out mass shootings and experts believe the real toll was much higher.
