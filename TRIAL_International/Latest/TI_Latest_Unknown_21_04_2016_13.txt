According to Jean-Pierre Christian in its work “Rwanda, the media of the Genocide”, she would have congratulated young people of a district which had massacred an entire family Tutsi: “I saw your work; you have been a model for the youth. It was necessary to kill these people and you killed them well. You should not kill the father with a bullet in the head, it was necessary to cut him in small pieces”.

Bemeriki was arrested on 13 June 1999, by the Rwandan army in Minova in the South-Kivu Province, and was transferred to Rwanda few days after her catch.
