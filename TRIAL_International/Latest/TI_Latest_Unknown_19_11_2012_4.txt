facts 

Miroslav Tadic was born on 12 May 1937 in Novi Grad, in the Municipality of Odzak. He is a school teacher by profession.
According to the Office of the Prosecutor of the ICTY (International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia), he was President of the “Commission for (Population) Exchange” in Bosanski Samac from 17 April 1992 until 1995. He was also a member of the “Crisis Cell of the Municipality of Bosanski Samac”, an executive body peremptorily instituted by the Serbs in July 1992.
He was indicted by the Prosecutor of the ICTY for planning, instigating, and ordering, in collaboration with other political leaders, a campaign of persecutions whose aim it was to get rid of all the non-Serbian inhabitants of the Municipalities of Bosanski Samac and Odzak.
The Serbian authorities in so doing arrested and imprisoned a large number of individuals and also forced many civilians to leave their homes. They also disseminated rules and regulations which discriminated against the non-Serbs, insisted that the great majority of them be subjected to forced labour and undertook a large scale appropriation of their personal and commercial property.
In carrying out this plan, Miroslav Tadic reportedly committed serious violations of international humanitarian law. Most notably acts of torture were said to have been committed under his supervision.
This campaign lasted approximately from 1st September to 31st December 1993.
Before 17 April 1992, the Municipality of Bosanski Samac was made up of close to 17’000 Muslims and Croatians living in Bosnia against an overall population of around 33’000. In May 1995, there remained less than 300.
Miroslav Tadic gave himself up voluntarily on 14 February 1998 and was transferred on the following day to the ICTY.
