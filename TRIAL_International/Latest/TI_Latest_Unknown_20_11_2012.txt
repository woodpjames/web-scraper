In 1994, during the massacres, Ephrem Nkezabera was said to have played a key role within the Interahamwe (an extremist Hutu militia which was heavily involved in the genocide), as a member of its National Committee.

Ephrem Nkezabera initially fled to the Congo, before going to the Netherlands. He was arrested on 21 June 2004 by the Belgian authorities whilst in hiding at the home of one of his sons in Brussels.
