Assad Hassan Sabra was born on 15 October 1976, in Beirut, Lebanon. He is the son of Hassan Tahan Sabra and Leila Saleh.
On 14 February 2005, Rafik Hariri, former Prime Minister of Lebanon, was assassinated as a result of a terrorist act in which a suicide bomber detonated explosives in Beirut. The explosion killed Hariri and 21 other persons and injured 231 persons. At that time, Hariri was a Member of Parliament. After the explosion, AI-Jazeera in Beirut received a video on which a man claimed to be the suicide bomber and a member of a fictional fundamentalist group called “Victory and Jihad in Greater Syria”.
The investigation using communications analysis, witness statements and documentary evidence, identified four persons among others who played a role in that terrorist act. The investigators identified Sabra, as well as Salim Jamil Ayyash, Mustafa Amine Badreddine, and Hussein Hassan Oneissi.
