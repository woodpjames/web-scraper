facts

Saeed Mortazavi was born in 1967.
On 18 May 2003, he was appointed Prosecutor General of Tehran and remained in this position until 29 August 2009.
In 2003, the Canadian government accused him of having arrested and supervised the torturing of Canadian-Iranian photographer Zahra Kazemi who eventually died in custody. In late 2003, a national parliamentary report found that Mortazavi attempted to falsify the facts about the death of Kazemi. Mortazavi has denied all accusations.
Mortazavi has become known as “the butcher of the press”, a name he has earned by shutting down 60 pro-reform newspapers. In 2004, he ordered the detention of 20 bloggers who were forced to confess alleged illicit activities. Journalists have reported to have received threats after testifying about torture in custody. In 2008, he ordered the detention and torture of students who were protesting against the government.
Moreover, he played a key role in the repression of protesters after the 2009 election which resulted in the reelection of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad by allegedly arresting 600 government opponents. In 2010, the Iranian parliament identified Mortazavi as the main responsible for the mistreatment of 147 prisoners in the Kahrizak detention centre. Three detainees who were held in Kahrizak were beaten to death, namely Mohammad Kamrani, Amir Javadifar and Mohsen Ruholamini.
The Supreme Leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, ordered the closure of the detention centre and to prosecution of those responsible for the crimes committed against the detainees.
