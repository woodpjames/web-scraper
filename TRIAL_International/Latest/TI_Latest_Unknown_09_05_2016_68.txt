facts


Milkan Gojkovic was born on 16 July 1966 in Maravici in the Rogatica municipality of Bosnia-Herzegovina. During the conflict which raged in Bosnia-Herzegovina from 1992 to 1995, Gojkovic decided to join the Serb army of Bosnia-Herzegovina, otherwise known as the “Army of Republika Srpska”.
At the same time as the town of Sarajevo was under siege and the Grbavica district was under the control of the Bosnian Serbs, Gojkovic and three other men, including one known as Veselin Vlahovic, called “Batko”, broke into a house in Grabavica during the night of 29 September 1992. This house was inhabited by a Bosniak couple with their two year old girl. Whilst one of their companions stood guard outside the house, Gojkovic was said to have threatened and submitted the woman to sexual violence in a way which was later described as being particularly cruel. Her husband was forced to witness the aggression by Batko and the other soldier. Batko then reportedly killed the husband whilst his wife managed to escape and fled with her child to a nearby house.
Ever since the end of the conflict, Gojkovic has resided in Rogatica in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
Gojkovic was arrested on 27 November 2014 by the State Investigation and Protection Agency of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
