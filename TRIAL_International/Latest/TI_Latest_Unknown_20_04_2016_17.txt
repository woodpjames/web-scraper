On 11 September 1973 Krassnoff took part in an attack on the house of president Allende which left completely wrecked. From 7 January until 8 February 1974, he was sent to the School of the Americas in Panama where he took a course on urban counter- insurgency operations. On his return, he was promoted to the rank of Captain and acquired a reputation of being particularly tough.
He became third man of the DINA’s Metropolitan Brigade (Santiago) under the command of Morén Brito and commander of the Halcón Brigade which operated the Villa Grimaldi Torture Centre..
Krassnoff is promoted by General Pinochet for his « good offices » to the rank of Major and in 1990, shortly before the return to democracy, to Brigadier General. He became commander of the Tucapel Regiment, later Chief of Staff of the army 4th Division. In October 1998, he discreetly retired from the army, as part of the policy of the new Commander in Chief of the army, general Juan Emilio Cheyre, who chooses to ‘purify’ the institution from its most polemical characters. He is accused of involvement in the disappearance of 91 persons. However, all accusations against him are systematically dismissed by the military justice applying the 1978 amnesty laws.
Until 2001, he ran a military hotel in Santiago. Since 2001, several legal proceedings against him have been opened.
