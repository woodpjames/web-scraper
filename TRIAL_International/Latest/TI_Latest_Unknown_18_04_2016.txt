Lino Efrén García Castillo, a Guatemalan national, is a former officer of National Civil Police (PNC) in Guatemala.
In the year of 2009, three people (Rosa del Carmen Coyoy Ixcot, Lauro Osvaldo Andrino and Jonhy Estuardo Sac Rojas) were murdered by the alleged parallel structure existing within the Police and the Ministry of the Interior in Guatemala. This structure, allegedly led by Marlene Raquel Blanco Lapola, a former PNC director and deputy-minister of security, is suspected of performing contract killings. The officers working in PNC, including García Castillo, are suspected of being given instructions by their superiors to locate, abduct and take tough measures, like torture or even killing, against suspected criminals who extorted money from transport businessmen. It is additionally alleged that this structure ran a campaign of “social cleansing”.
The alleged members of this parallel structure and suspects in the case are Blanco Lapola, García Castillo, Israel Chavez and Edwin Nathanael Chipix Nox.
The arrest warrants for them were issued by the Court of the First Criminal Instance for extrajudicial killings and criminal association charges.
On 23 March 2012, PNC officers, Ministry of the Interior and the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala arrested García Castillo and other suspects.
