Algeria: mother of disappeared seeks justice before UN
09.07.2008
The Advocacy Center – TRIAL (ACT) has submitted an individual communication to the UN Human Rights Committee against Algeria. The case relates to the enforced disappearance of Mr Mohamed LEMMIZ

The Advocacy Center – TRIAL (ACT), representing Mohamed Lemmiz’s mother, lodged an individual complaint against Algeria before the United Nations Human Rights Committee in July 2008.
Mr. Lemmiz disappeared after having been arrested by members of the Algerian army, on 30   April 1996. His family, despite tireless efforts, never obtained from the national authorities any information regarding his fate or whereabouts.
The ACT requests the Human Rights Committee to declare that Algeria violated the fundamental rights of Mohamed Lemmiz as well as his mother’s, and that, as a result, redress should be granted.
