Born in 1924, Anibal Guevara Rodriguez joined the Army in 1947. After a long military career during which he climbed in the hierarchy, he became brigadier general in 1976, then chief of staff. In January 1980, General Fernándo Romeo Lucas García appointed him minister of defence.
On 31 January 1980, Guevara Rodriguez allegedly attacked the Spanish embassy, where 36 peasant representatives of the CUC trade union (Comité de Unidad Campesina) had taken refuge. Upon his alleged orders, the embassy was burnt, provoking the death of 35 peasants and three Spanish members of the embassy. A wounded peasant was allegedly abducted from the hospital, tortured and killed. Guevara Rodriguez allegedly organized many other enforced disappearances, tortures and murders of members of Mayan ethnicity, political opponents and trade unionists.
Representing the Popular Democratic Front Party, he won the presidential elections of 4 March 1982 but was immediately accused of electoral fraud. Many manifestations were organized by his opponents, culminating in the coup of 23 March 1982, by which General Efrain Rios Montt seized power.
He stood again for elections in 1995 but was defeated by Alvaro Arzú.
In December 1999, the Rigoberta Menchú Foundation, as well as several families of victims of repression, filed a complaint against Guevara Rodriguez and seven other Guatemalan high-ranking officials before the Spanish National Court, the highest judicial body of Spain, for torture and genocide.
