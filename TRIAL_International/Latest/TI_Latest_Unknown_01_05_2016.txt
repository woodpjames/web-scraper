Abdul Zahir, is thought by American Intelligence to have been born in 1972. He was said to have served as a translator for the Taliban in Kabul and had later been chosen to work as a money courier for Abdul Hadi al Iraqi, a commander and accountant for al Qaeda.
He allegedly purchased a photocopy machine to mass produce anti-American leaflets. These leaflets were, according to the U.S. Pentagon, designed to recruit anti-American Afghans to plan and conduct operations against U.S. soldiers, and to spread anti-American propaganda.
Abdul Zahir was said to have been entrusted by Al Qaeda with US$ 50,000 to fund terrorist acts against coalition forces. He reportedly distributed this money to other terrorist cells to support terrorist operations.
In early 2002, Abdul Zahir allegedly travelled to Peshawar, Pakistan and joined Abdul Hadi al Iraqi and others to plan explosives attacks against U.S. forces and civilian foreigners in the Zormat and Paktia provinces in Afghanistan.
On 4 March 2002, Abdul Zahir and others were said to have targeted a passing vehicle carrying foreign journalists through the eastern town of Zormat. They threw a grenade through the window of the vehicle. In the attack, Toronto Star correspondent Kathleen Kenna suffered severe leg injuries and life-threatening internal injuries.
Abdul Zahir was arrested in July 2002. He is currently detained at the U.S. military base at Guant√°namo/ Cuba. He was charged by the Pentagon on 20 January 2006.
