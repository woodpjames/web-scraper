He subsequently obtained a doctorate at the Belgrade University’s Faculty of Law on 26 November 1979. In December 1979, Seselj joined the Yugoslav People’s Army to serve the mandatory military service and was stationed in Belgrade. He founded, on 23 February 1991, the “Serbian Radical Party” (SRS) and was elected in June 1991 at the Parliament of the Serbian Republic.
According to the indictment, Seselj participated in a joint criminal enterprise, the purpose of which was the permanent forcible removal of a majority of non-Serbs, in particular the Muslims and the Croats, from about one third of the territory of Croatia, vast portions of the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina and certain parts of the autonomous province of Vojvodina in Serbia, in order to integrate these regions in a new State under Serb domination. Seselj is reported to have participated in this joint criminal enterprise from 1991 until September 1993.
After 1993, Seselj continued to play an important political role in Serbia. On 30 May 2015, he was re-elected leader of the Serbian Radical Party.
