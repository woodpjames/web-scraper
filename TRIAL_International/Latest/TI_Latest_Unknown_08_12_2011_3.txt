In 1999, Sasa Cvjetan was a reservist in the “Scorpions” a special anti terrorist unit of the Serbian police force, which reported to the Interior Ministry.
The allegations against Sasa Cvjetan were related to the 28 March 1999 massacre by the “Scorpions” of 19 Albanian civilians in Podujevo, a massacre in which Cvjetan participated.
In March 1999, around one million Albanians fled Kosovo after the Serb leader,Slobodan Milosevic, initiated one of the most deadly ethnic cleansing operations in the Balkan region. It was during this period that a squadron of the special police forces, the “Scorpions”, was sent there.
On 28 March 1999, reservists of this special unit entered the town of Podujevo and ordered the inhabitants out of their homes. Amongst the residents was a family of 19 members who were riddled with bullets by the reservists in their own garden: amongst those hit and killed were seven women and seven children.
The Serb Justice Minister of the time decided to open an inquiry into the murder of Albanians from Podujevo during that same year right in the middle of the war. The Serb police then arrested Sasa Cvjetan, who confessed to his participation in the Podujevo massacre in a written affidavit. Nevertheless, he was later released by the police authorities.
In January 2001, Sasa Cvjetan was again arrested by the Serbian police. The inquiry into his involvement in the Podujevo massacre was reopened and ended in his being indicted in April 2002.
