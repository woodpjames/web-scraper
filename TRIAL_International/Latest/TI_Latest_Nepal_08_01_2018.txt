Nepal extends Transitional Bodies’ mandates
08.01.2018
Nepal’s Cabinet of ministers announced on 5 January 2018 the extension by one year of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) and the Commission on Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons (CIEDP).
Both transitional justice bodies were created in 2015, nearly a decade after the end of the civil war. Their mandates were supposed to close last year, but with still thousands of complaints to settle, their mandates were extended.
Back then, TRIAL International and four other NGOs welcomed this decision. They also insisted, however, that the extension of the transitional justice mechanisms’ mandate was but the first step, and should be part of a bigger effort towards accountability.
Today, these conclusions still apply. The bodies’ amount of work is titanic. Every year the clock seems to be ticking louder and history is repeating itself: Nepalese war victims are still waiting for justice and reparation.
