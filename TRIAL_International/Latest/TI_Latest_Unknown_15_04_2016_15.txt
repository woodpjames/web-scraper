Solomon Maldonado Rios, a Guatemalan national, was a military commissioner in El Jute, Guatemala.
On 19 October 1981, Jacobo Crisóstomo Chegüen, Miguel Ángel Chegüen Crisóstomo, Raúl Chegüen, Inocente Gallardo, Antolín Gallardo Rivera, Valentín Gallardo Rivera, Santiago Gallardo Rivera and Tránsito Rivera–all from the municipality and department of Chiquimula, were abducted in the village El Jute by military personnel of the military area of Zacapa.
Marco Antonio Sanchez Samayoa was in command of the military Area of Zacapa and responsible for controlling the civilian population. The day the facts occurred, Maldonado Rios was one of the military commissioners in El Jute, along with Álvarez Ramos and Domingo Rios Martinez. The commissioners informed the commandant of the area that there was a guerrilla centre in that community. On 19 October 1981, the three military commissioners accompanied the militaries to locate and abduct the eight aforementioned people.
The victims, presumed members of the armed guerilla, allegedly suffered cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment upon being abducted. They were transferred to the military area of Zacapa without having been made available to the competent authority. Their fate remains unknown.
On 13 June 2005, warrants for arrest and preventive detention as well as indictments were issued against Maldonado Rios, Sánchez Samayoa, Ríos Martínez and Álvarez Ramos.
