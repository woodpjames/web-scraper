facts

Pedro Octavio Espinoza Bravo was born in Chile on 19 August 1932. He was a Major, then colonel and finally general brigadier, second in command of the DINA (the secret police under Pinochet’s regime lead by Juan Manuel Guillermo Contreras Sepulveda)
On 11 September 1973, General Pinochet succeeded in a coup d’état and brought a military junta in to rule Chile. During the 17 years of the dictatorship, parliament was closed, the media were systematically censored and political opponents were kidnapped, tortured and murdered. Over 3000 people were murdered and around 100 others disappeared under the dictatorship.
Espinoza Bravo was a member of the “Caravan of Death”, a group from the Chilean army that travelled around Chile in 1973 in a helicopter and had as its mission “to accelerate trials and standardise the criteria for administering justice” for those who had been detained following Pinochet’s military coup. These soldiers brutally executed 75 political prisoners and buried them in unmarked graves. He was also in charge with Raúl Iturriaga, director of the external service of the DINA, of the assassination of General Carlos Prats in Buenos Aires in September 1974.
In November 1993, Espinoza Bravo was condemned by a Chilean Court for complicity in the murders committed in 1976 of Orlando Letelier, a former government minister under the previous president, and Ronni Moffit, his assistant in Washington DC. The United States did not obtain Espinoza’s extradition and he stayed in position at the DINA until 1995. Because the crime was committed outside the country, he did not benefit from the 1978 amnesty laws. Espinoza was condemned to 6 years in prison and was detained in a special military prison.
