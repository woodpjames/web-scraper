Gustavo Cardoso Mejía was a Second-Lieutenant and Instructor in the Rangers Special Forces Regiment, an elite brigade in the Bolivian army located in the town of Challapata.
At the end of September 2010, during what the military referred to as a training program within the context of a course on the subject of prisoners of war, Corporal Guido Flores Cortez was strung up from a tree by his feet, with his hands tied behind his back. His head was then immersed several times in a tank of water. One of his colleagues filmed the scene and handed over this document to Canal 9 of Oruro Television, which aired this film on 28 September 2010.
One week later, the Commander of the Armed Forces, General Ramiro de la Fuenta, issued a pronouncement which “placed four military personnel at the disposition of the civilian judiciary”.
Cardoso and his three colleagues, Lieutenant Colonel Roberto Quiroz Pinto and Second-Lieutenants José Luis Copa Flores and John Henry Rojas Catacora, were charged with torture. They were initially held in the barracks of the Special Anti-Crime Force in La Paz, the capital, whilst awaiting their transfer to a prison in San Pedro de Oruro.
