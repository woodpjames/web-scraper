DRC: TRIAL intervenes as expert in reparations case

An op-ed by Daniele Perissi 
Could the ordeal of Lemera’s victims finally end? An unrelated case before African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights may disentangle their situation in unexpected ways.
2009, in the village of Lemera, South Kivu. Seven women, two of which are pregnant, are raped by Congolese soldiers.
November 2014. The NGO REDRESS files a complaint with the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights (ACHPR). The victim they represent, S.A., was also raped by soldiers.
What do these two events have to do with each other? Perhaps surprisingly, the case of S.A. could be instrumental in obtaining reparations for the victims of Lemera – and many others.
