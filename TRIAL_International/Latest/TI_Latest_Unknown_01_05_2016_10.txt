facts

Predrag Banovic was born on 28 October 1969 in Prijedor, Bosnia and Herzegovina. Predrag Banovic regularly performed duties as a guard at the Keraterm camp.
The indictment alleged that during the early morning hours of 30 April 1992, Bosnian Serb police and army forces seized physical control of the town of Prijedor. Following the forcible take-over of Prijedor, severe restrictions were imposed on all aspects of life for non-Serbs, principally Bosnian Muslims and Bosnian Croats, including movement and employment. According to the indictment, Bosnian Serb authorities in the Prijedor municipality unlawfully segregated, detained and confined more than 7,000 Bosnian Muslims, Bosnian Croats and other non-Serbs from the Prijedor area in the Omarska, Trnopolje and Keraterm camps between May and August 1992.
It was alleged that interrogations were conducted on a daily basis at the Omarska and Keraterm camps. Severe beatings, killings as well as other forms of physical and psychological abuse, including sexual assault, were said to have been commonplace at the Omarska and Keraterm camps. In addition, Omarska and Keraterm camps also operated in a manner designed to discriminate and subjugate the non-Serbs by inhumane acts and cruel treatment. These acts included the brutal living conditions imposed on the prisoners.
The crimes enumerated in the indictment were the result of a joint criminal enterprise, which operated within the Keraterm and Omarska camps.
Predrag Banovic was arrested in Serbia on 8 November 2001 and transferred to the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) on 9 November 2001.
