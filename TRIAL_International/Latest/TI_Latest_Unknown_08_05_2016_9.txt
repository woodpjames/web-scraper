facts


Dervis Cavalic and his brother Esad Cavalic were born in Derventa, Bosnia and Herzegovina. During the war in the former Yugoslavia they were both members of the Croatian Defence Council (HVO).  Dervis Cavalic and Esad Cavalic were involved in the mistreatment of Serb civilians in Derventa between April and June 1992.
On 26 April 1992 they beat and kicked civilian prisoner Blagoje Djuras in a detention centre of the Yugoslav People’s Army (JNA) in Derventa and thereby caused severe rib fractures  to the detainee. Djuras had been imprisoned on the accusation of having killed someone. However, he was later killed by other HVO members in the same room in which he had earlier been mistreated by the Cavalic brothers.
The Cavalic brothers also physically abused Pero Novakovic, another detainee at the same detention facility, and beat prisoners in the Rabic detention camp near Derventa, also run by the JNA.
The trial against the Cavalic brothers started on 1 October 2012 at the District Court in Doboj, Republika Srpska, Bosnia and Herzegovina.
