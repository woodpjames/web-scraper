facts

Heinz Fritz Traeger was born on 9 August 1923 in Zeulenroda-Thüringen. During the Second World War he served in Italy as a soldier in the 16th armoured reconnaissance company of the « Reichsführer-SS » under the command of Walter Reder. Traeger is jointly responsible for one of the worst war crimes committed by German soldiers in Italy during the Second World War.
In the massacre of Marzabotto, a municipal in the Emilia-Romagna, the « Reichsführer-SS » destroyed large parts of the region and killed more than 770 civilians, most of them old men, women and children. Out of the 770 listed victims, 213 were children under the age of 13. The SS-men broke into houses, schools and churches, where they killed their targets with machineguns, threw grenades and set buildings and churches on fire. The few survivors could only get away by hiding themselves from the bullets under the dead bodies of their relatives and neighbours.
Only with the finding of documents on German war crimes committed in Italy during World War II, that were stored in the so named « Schrank der Schande » between 1960 and 1994, ten SS-men were convicted for their joint responsibility in the massacre in Mazabotto. One of them was Heinz Fritz Traeger who was absently convicted to lifetime imprisonment for multiple murders of civilians by the military tribunal of La Spezia.
