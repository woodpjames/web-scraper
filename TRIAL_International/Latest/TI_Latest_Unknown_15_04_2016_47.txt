facts

Alberto Julio Candiotti was part of Argentinian army’s Battalion 601, lieutenant of the Amphibian Engineers Group 601 of Santa Fe.
During the seven-year military dictatorship in Argentina an estimated 30,000 people disappeared and were taken to government facilities where they were tortured and eventually killed. Many victims were opponents of the government, but there were also ordinary citizens among them. In the 1980s, the Argentinian government passed amnesty laws, preventing the perpetrators from facing prosecution. This changed in 2003 when Argentina’s Congress overturned the amnesties.
Alberto Candiotti was allegedly involved in abductions, torture and forced disappearances in the clandestine detention center “Brigada de Investigaciones de San Justo”, which was part of the “Circuito Camps” during the military dictatorship. Between January 1978 and April 1979 he was assigned to the command “Inteligencia 101 de La Plata”, which was verifiably connected to the illegal repressive actions of the army.
Interpol has been looking for him since 2011. On 6 March 2012 Argentina also issued a national arrest warrant for Candiotti. The Argentinian Ministry of Justice and Human Rights had offered an award of 100,000 pesos for details on his whereabouts.
The charges filed against him with the National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons (Conadep) in 1983 alleged his involvement in the disappearance of Roberto Daniel Suárez, who was doing his mandatory military service when he was abducted on 1 August 1977 and Candiotti was his superior.
Candiotti was arrested in his apartment in Montevideo (Uruguay) on 23 May 2013.
