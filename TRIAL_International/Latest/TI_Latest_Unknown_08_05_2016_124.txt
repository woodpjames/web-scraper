William Calley was born on 8 June 1943. At the time of the events, he was a lieutenant in the US Army.
On 16 March 1968, around eight o’clock in the morning, Charlie Company, one of the three units making up the Barker Task Force of the US Army, entered the village of My Lai in Quang Ngai Province situated in South Vietnam. The Company was under the command of Captain Ernest Medina. In little over three hours, members of this company executed around 500 civilians including children, women and elderly people.
Lieutenant William Calley, as leader of one group, played an active role in the massacre. With the help of one of his soldiers, he fired on a group of some 80 civilians, which had been assembled in the village square. The quasi-totality of these people were shot to death. He also ordered his soldiers to kill approximately another 80 people who had been gathered together in a ditch. He himself took an active part in these executions.
In March 1969, Ronald Ridenhour, an ex GI, having heard of what had happened in My Lai, decided to report the incident to the US authorities. At that time the case was transmitted to the Inspector General of the army for investigation. It was then subsequently committed to the army’s Criminal Investigation Division.
Parallel to this, the Defence Department had held its own investigation. These proceedings culminated in a report (the Peers Report), which recommended prosecution for several soldiers and officers – notably for incidents of murder and rape.
