facts 

Emmanuel Uwayezu is a Hutu Rwandese born in Muremera the 18 March 1962. He was the Director of the Kibelho College of Arts in the Southern Province where 80 Tutsi students, aged from 12 to 20, were killed by militiamen the 7 May 1994.
He allegedly committed various hostile acts against the Tutsi students, as detailed in a report issued in may 2009 by the NGO African Rights, such as allowing to spread ethnic hatred at the school, labelling all Tutsis as inyenzi  [cockroaches] and enemies of Rwanda, or having various contacts with the participants of the killings in the days before the attack.
The 7 May 2009, he allegedly abandoned the school laying the groundwork for the killings. Uwayezu then moved to Italy, where he was reached, while working as a vicar in a parish in Empoli, within the Diocesis of Florence, by an international arrest warrant issued by the Prosecutor General of the Republic of Rwanda for crimes against humanity, genocide complicity and genocide conspiracy.
The arrest warrant was implemented by Interpol’s National Central Bureau in Rome and Italian Carabinieri, who arrested Uwayezu on 20 October 2009.
