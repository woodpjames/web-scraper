facts

Percy Mahendra Rajapaksa also known as Mahinda Rajapaksa was born on 18 November 1945 in Hambantota, Sri Lanka. His family was very active in politics and his father and uncle were famous politicians. Rajapaksa went to college in Colombo but when his father died in 1967 Rajapaksa took over as the candidate for the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and in 1970 he was elected to the Parliament as the youngest member in history. During the years that followed, Rajapaksa went to law school in Colombo and he was accepted as an attorney in 1977.
In 1989, after several years of not having a seat in Parliament, Rajapaksa was re-elected to represent the Hambantota District. In 1994, after SLFP won the election Rajapaksa was appointed the Minister of Labour and subsequently Minister of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources. In 2001 the SLFP lost the election to the United National Party (UNP) and in 2002 Rajapaksa was chosen as the Leader of the Opposition. On 17 November 2005, Rajapaksa won the presidential election with 50.3% of the votes.
Rajapaksa and his Government are accused of committing war crimes during the end of the 25-year civil war between the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and the Government, a conflict which officially ended in 2009 when the national army defeated the LTTE.
Examples of the alleged violations of international humanitarian law by the national army include deliberate attacks against clearly marked civilian objects such as hospitals and camps, and naval attacks on displaced civilians in a no-fire zone.
In U.S, a suit was brought by relatives to students shot dead in the town of Trincomalee, and relatives of aid workers for a French organisation killed near there in August 2006. Also taking part in the lawsuit were relatives of a family killed as the military crushed the Tamil Tigers in 2009.
