facts

Billy Fernando Joya Amendola, more commonly known as ‘Billy Joya’ was born in Honduras, Central America. He enrolled at military academy at the age of 14, from which he was expelled. After this, he was able to establish an army career and first began to work in the military police. In 1981, along with other Hondurian soldiers, he received education at the ‘School of the Americas’. The ‘School of the Americas’ was an institution, which was a part of a system that attempted to spread communism across the continent of America.
From 1984 onwards, Billy Joya joined the Battalion 3-16 and was responsible for the tactical department. The Battalion 3-16 operated since 1979 but disappeared after several name changes in 2002. This elite battalion was linked to several murders and disappearances of suspected insurgents. Whilst in this battalion, Billy Joya set up two death squads, known as ‘Lynx’ and ‘Cobra’.
Billy Joya was accused of the imprisonment and torture of six students in 1982. At the time, he was operating under the pseudonym ‘Licenciado Arrazaolo’ and suspected these students of insurgent activities. On 27 April 1982, the students were captured, tortured and finally released after eight days by Billy Joya and six of his men. Billy Joya was identified by the victims as being the main person responsible in the allegations of torture. Billy Joya has also been attributed as being the main instigator in at least sixteen other cases of torture and murder.
In 1995, when an arrest warrant was issued for him, Joya fled into exile first to Columbia and then to Spain. In 1998, Billy Joya returned voluntarily to Honduras and was detained until August 2000 when he was released from custody due to lack of evidence.
Following the coup of 2009, Roberto Micheletti was appointed de facto president and Billy Joya was given the role of national security advisor.
