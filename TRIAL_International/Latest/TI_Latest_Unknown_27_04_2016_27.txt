When the German military occupied Rome in 1943, Kappler was appointed as Chief of the Security Police and Security Service for all SS and police units deployed in Rome and finally got promoted to Obersturmbannführer of the Waffen-SS. He was responsible for to the round up and the deportation of the Jews of Rome.
In September 1943 he accepted 58 kilos of Gold from the Jewish community in return for the warranty not to deport any members of the Roman Jewish community. However, only a few weeks later, he arrested more than 1000 Jews and had them deported to Auschwitz. His plan was to deport the entire Jewish community of Rome (up to 10’000 people).
On 23 March 1944, a bomb planted by the Italian resistance killed 33 German soldiers. As a consequence, Kappler drew up a list of 320 civilians who were to be executed in reprisal. In total, 335 civilians were executed on 24 March 1944 in the Ardeatine Caves near Rome under the direction of Erich Priebke.
British authorities arrested him in 1945, after unsuccessfully seeking refugee within the Vatican. The British authorities turned Kappler over to the Italian government in 1946.
