facts

Marcel Bivugabagabo was born on 1 January 1954 in Mabuye, Rwanda. During the genocide in Rwanda in 1994 he was Lieutenant-Colonel of the Rwandan Armed Forces (RAF). From mid-April to July 1994 he was commander of the military operations in the prefectures of Ruhengeri and Gisenyi, in North-western Rwanda, replacing Augustin Bizimungu. Between 1992 and 1994 he was also a member of the Interahamwe, the extremist Hutu militia.
Pursuant to the indictment issued on 8 August 2007 by the Rwandan prosecutor, Bivugabagabo is accused of having, as Lieutenant-Colonel of the RAF, instigated, abetted and directed the planning, preparation and execution of armed attacks against Tutsi and moderate Hutu. These attacks are said to have taken place between April and July 1994 in the regions of Gisenyi and Ruhengeri. Bivugabagabo is accused of having participated in two attacks in particular. The first took place between 10 and 18 April 1994 in the buildings of the Court of Appeal of Ruhengeri. At the moment of the attack, this building served as a refuge for Tutsi refugees, especially women, children and elderly people. The second attack took place on the campus of Nyakinama University. During these two attacks hundreds of people were allegedly killed.
For several years, Bivugabagabo had been living in Toulouse, France, where he worked as guard in a security company.
In 2002, a red notice was issued by Interpol, requesting the arrest of Bivugabagabo in view of extradition. On 3 September 2007, the French authorities received a request for arrest and extradition by the Rwandan authorities. On 8 January 2008 Bivugabagabo was arrested by the French police in Toulouse on the basis of the request by Rwanda and the international arrest warrant.
