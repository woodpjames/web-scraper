Predrag Bogunic was born on 28 January 1949 in Goražde, in Bosnia and Herzegovina and is a former senior police officer.
Acting as de facto Commander of the Public Security Station of Goražde from late August 1992 through the second half of February 1993, Bogunic allegedly detained Serb civilians, including children, in the Goražde police station and other buildings in the town, often in inhumane and unhygienic conditions, which caused them great physical and mental harm.
In particular, from July to late October 1992 approximately 70 civilians were held in custody in four different apartments located near the police station. Other 35 civilians were illegally detained in police buildings in Goražde from July 1992 to February 1993.
It has also been alleged that some detainees lost their lives for denial of medical assistance in custody: two died in the police station, four deceased right after their release, while one tried to commit suicide and died in hospital after this attempt.
Bogunic is moreover charged with the unlawful detention of 31 civilians from the village of Bučje in police premises.
