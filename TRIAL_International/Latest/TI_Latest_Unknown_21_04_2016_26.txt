facts

Osvaldo Romo Mena was born on 20 April 1938 into a poor family in Santiago, Romo Mena grew up to become involved in crime; later he became an informant for the police. In 1970, Romo Mena accused Allende’s government of being repressive. Allende invited him to take part in a public survey. He became the people’s hero and was approached by the Revolutionary Left Movement (MIR), Allende’s left-wing party.
Despite being an informant for the police, Romo Mena was arrested during the coup d’état. A police officer picked him out of a line of prisoners who had been given the death sentence and told him that if he wanted to save himself, he should impersonate a leading member of Allende’s party in the cell that he was being sent to, to get as much information as possible from the prisoners. Romo Mena spent three months in the prison before being freed.
He was contracted by the DINA and joined Falcon I (Halcón I) of the Caupolicán Brigade; he was entrusted with the task of exterminating the MIR, under the orders of Lieutenant Miguel Krassnoff Marchenko. Knowing a great deal about the MIR’s members, their addresses, their contacts and their ways, Romo Mena organised an incredibly successful “hunt”. His enthusiasm in pursuing his victims and openly torturing them was particularly notable.
Identified by the survivors of the torture camps, Romo Mena fled to Brasil in 1977, aided by a secret, army-controlled network. In 1992 he was discovered and subsequently extradited to Chile. He was trialled 19 times for forced disappearances and was granted amnesty on each occasion by the military courts.
