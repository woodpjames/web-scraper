Slobodan Zoraja was born on 23 June 1965. He was a member of the Croatian Serb territorial defence forces and Chetnik unit “Dušan Silni” whose aim according to the indictment was to create “Great Serbia” and to ethnically cleanse parts of Croatia, including the village of Lovas.
The Dušan Silni cooperated with the Novi Sad army corps of the Jugoslav People’s Army and launched a cannon attack on the village of Lovas at around 7.30 am on 10 October 1991. According to the charges the cannons aimed at civilian targets, although the members of the Dušan Silni allegedly knew that there were no Croatian military units in the village. Subsequently, the Dušan Silni allegedly launched an infantry attack on the village killing altogether 30 civilians in the streets of Lovas in these attacks. Following the occupation of the village, between 10 and 18 October 1991 during the Battle of Vukovar, the Dušan Silni allegedly forced the Croatian civilians to wear white bands on their sleeves, marked their houses and restricted their movement. The charges against the members of the Dušan Silni also include the arrest, torture and threatening of Croatian civilians with death, alleged forced labour, robbery and rape of female villagers.
As a result of the crimes committed in Dušan Silni (popularly known in Croatia as the Lovas Killings), according to the charges, altogether 69 people were killed (24 of those in the mine field), 33 people were seriously injured (15 of those in the mine field).
Zoraja as a member of the Dušan Silni allegedly took part in these attacks against the civilians and was charged with genocide and war crimes against civilians.
