Facts

Miroslav Kurak was a member of the reserve force of the State Security Service (SDB), the intelligence service of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
In this capacity, Kurak allegedly murdered Serbian journalist Slavko Ćuruvija on 11 April 1999. The victim was shot in the back 17 times in front of his residence in Belgrade. According to his family and colleagues, Ćuruvija’s killing was motivated by his opposition against the regime of then-Serbian President Slobodan Milošević. Ćuruvija had been designated an enemy of the state due to his public criticism of Milošević and was systematically monitored by state security from 1996.
Kurak is believed to have left Serbia in the early 2000s and remains on the run from the authorities.
