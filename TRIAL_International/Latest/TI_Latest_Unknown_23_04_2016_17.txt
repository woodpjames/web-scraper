facts

Born in 1961, Riza Alijaj was commander of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA). The KLA emerged in 1996. It resorted to violent methods to gain control of the territory of Kosovo (autonomous province of Serbia, from 1999 placed under the administration of the NATO and the UN) and to expel of all non-Albanians.
Riza Alijaj, as Sabit Geci (see “ramifications”) are accused of having directed camps and Cahan Kukes, in northern Albania, where alleged collaborators with the Serbian regime and the supporters of the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK) were detained and tortured during the war. In the 1990s, during the conflict, the detention center in Kukes was a key supply point for the KLA. Camps in Kukes and Cahan had served as the basis of “logistics centers, training and supply,” but they have also been used to detain civilians in “unhealthy conditions”. Some of the 40 people who have been abused in Kukes were then detained by the KLA in Durres.
According to the indictment, the two men are suspected of “being involved directly in the abuse of detainees in the camps” in late March or early April 1999 until June 1999. The accused men allegedly imprisoned Kosovars who flew the conflict and who were suspected of collaborating with the Serbian regime, or defending “the political views different from those of the KLA.” Specifically, in this case, supporters of the LDK, or veterans of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Kosovo (FARK), loyal to Ibrahim Rugova were imprisoned.
The prisoners of these camps were regularly beaten, abused and humiliated. The two former commanders allegedly forced prisoners to have sexual intercourse without consent. They were also kept in unhealthy places and under poor sanitary conditions and deprived of food, water and medical treatment.
Sabit Geci was arested in May 2010 and Riza Alilaj in Jun 2010.
