facts 

Ejup Ganić was born in Sebečevo village near Novi Pazar, Serbia under the Albanian name Ganići. He is the founder and current president of Sarajevo School of Science and Technology and a regular professor of engineering science at the school.
He was Vice-president of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina from 1992 to 1995 and President from 1997 to 1999 and again from 2000 to 2001.
Ganić is accused of conspiracy to murder 40 Yugoslav People’s Army (JNA) soldiers in the Dobrovoljačka Street attack which took place on May 1992. The Dobrovoljačka Street attack, also known as Sarajevo column case, refers to the events of 2 May and 3 May 1992 when members of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH) attacked the withdrawing convoy of Yugoslav People’s Army (JNA) troops that were exiting the city of Sarajevo according to the withdrawal agreement.
The attack was carried out by the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina after the Yugoslav People’s Army captured President Alija Izetbegović at Sarajevo airport the day before. Serbian authorities allege that as acting president, Dr. Ganic ordered these attacks including other attacks on a medical convoy and a hospital.
Ganic was one of 19 people for whom arrest warrants were issued in Serbia in November 2009, accused of conspiracy to murder in breach of the Geneva conventions.
Ganić was arrested by the Scotland Yard Extradition Unit at Heathrow Airport in London on 1 March 2010 after Serbian judicial authorities issued an extradition warrant.
