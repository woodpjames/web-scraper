facts

Božo Bačelić was born on 29 August 1970 in the town of Šibenik in Croatia. At the time of these facts, he was an officer in command of an elucidation squadron in the 113th regiment of the Croatian Army.
As an officer in command, he participated, amongst others, in operation ‘Tempête’, a military offensive led by the Croatian Forces, during the armed conflict between the Croatian Army and Serbian paramilitary groups, by order of the former President, Franjo Tuđman. The operation took place between 4 and 7 August 1995. In only four days, Croatia regained control over the majority of its territory that had been occupied in 1991: northern Dalmatia, Lika, Kordun and Banovine. The estimated losses include: around 560 Serbian soldiers who were killed; between 1100 and 1430 injured; 4000 prisoners; and between 100,000 and 200,000 Serbians fled to Serbia (Voïvodine) or Bosnia. On the Croatian side between 174 and 211 soldiers were killed.
Bačelić has been accused of homicide and the burning of an elderly Serbian couple, Milica Damjanić, 74, and Nikola Damjanić, 76. On 11 August 1995, a few days after operation ‘Tempête’ had been completed, during a search on land in Prokljan, in the municipality of Skradin, Bačelić noticed the couple in front of their house and opened fire. The couple died immediately. Three recruits in Bačelić’s regiment, Ante Mamić, Luka Vuko and Jurica Ravlić, placed boards, tires, branches and fishing nets over the bodies and burned them, under Bačelić’s orders.
Furthermore Bačelić has been accused of the murder of prisoner of war, Vuk Mandić, a member of the Serbian Krajina Army, RSK. He is alleged to have shot Mandić on 9 or 10 August 1995 (the exact date is unknown) at Varivode, with the help of Mamić, Vuko and Ravlić. After they captured Mandić at Mandići, near to Kistanje, they tied his hands and put him in an army vehicle to take him to an abandoned house near to road Đevrske-Kistanje. Once there, they lay him against the house wall and opened fire. After he died they freed him from his shackles.
On the 13 June 2013, Bačelić was sentenced by the Rural District Supreme Court of Split, to five years and ten months imprisonment for war crimes committed under the context of armed conflict between the Croatian Army and Serbian paramilitary groups, the first instance verdict.
