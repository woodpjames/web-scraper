Nicolás de Bari Hermoza Ríos was born on 20 December 1945. During the presidency of Alberto Fujimori, Hermoza Ríos was appointed General Commander of Peruvian Army in December 1991 and General Commander of the Joint Command of the Armed Forces in January 1992. On 5 April 1992, Fujimori launched a “self-coup”, suspended the Constitution, dissolved the Congress and ordered the reorganisation of the Judiciary. Consequently the political regime became a triumvirate consisting of the President, his informal security advisor Vladimiro Lenin Montesinos Torres and the President of the Joint Command of the Armed Forces. Hermoza Ríos was responsible for the Army Intelligence Direction (DINTE) and the Army Intelligence Service (SIE), whose leaders and troops participated in the formation of “Grupo Colina”, a paramilitary armed squad joined to the National Intelligence Service (SIN) which operated under the knowledge of the Presidency of the Republic and the Army Command.
He was charged with crimes related to the Colina Group activities. In particular, this group was accused of executing 15 civilians, including an 8-year-old child, in 1991 in the Barrios Altos district of Lima. He was also said to be responsible for the disappearance of 9 students from the University of La Cantuta and of one of their professors in 1992. He was also allegedly linked to the kidnapping, torture and execution of Mariela Lucy Barreto, whose body was found decapitated in March 1997.
He was also accused of being responsible of the killing of the six farmers in the town of Pativilca in 1992. On 29 January 1992, following orders from General Hermoza, around 20 members of the Colina Group death squad allegedly drove from Lima to Pativilca, where they searched for and forcibly removed six men from their homes. The victims were allegedly tortured with a blow torch and murdered. Their bodies were left in a nearby cane field.
