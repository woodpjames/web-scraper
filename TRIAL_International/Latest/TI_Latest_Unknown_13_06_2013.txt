facts

Callixte Mbarushimana, an ethnic Hutu, was born on 24 July 1963 in the village of Ndusu (Ruhengeri), Northern Rwanda. He studied technology and became an information technology specialist. In 1991 he received a contract as a consultant with the United Nations Development Programme and worked with the UN until 2001.
In April 2001, he was arrested in Kosovo after the issuance of an arrest warrant by Rwanda. Rwandan authorities alleged that Mbarushimana directed and participated in the murder of 32 people in 1994 — including U.N. employees he was hired to protect — during the Rwandan genocide. Kosovo refused the extradition because death penalty still existed in Rwanda.
On 4 May 2001, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) started an investigation against Mbarushimana but in September 2002, the then-chief prosecutor of the ICTR – Carla del Ponte – refused to indict the Mbarushimana because of lack of sufficient evidence against him.
In 2003 he was granted refugee status in France. At the same time, he categorically denied the accusations of murder against him, despite Rwanda issued an arrest warrant against him and demanded his extradition.
In July 2007 Mbarushimana became Executive Secretary of the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR).
Based in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Rwanda’s border region, and composed of Rwandan Hutu rebels, the FDLR is considered one of the entities most responsible of the insecurity in the Great Lakes Region. Several of its members are prosecuted by international and Rwandan justice for their alleged involvement in the 1994 genocide, that killed over 800,000 people, mainly Tutsis.
Between 20 January 2009 and 31 December 2009, in North and South Kivu in DRC, a series of attacks, both widespread and systematic, were allegedly carried out on a large scale by FDLR troops against the civilian population. Thus, various crimes against humanity and war crimes were allegedly committed during the armed conflict between FDLR and the Armed Forces of Democratic Republic of Congo (FARDC) together with the Rwandan Defence Forces (RDF), and with the United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO). The alleged crimes include murder, torture, rape, attacks against civilian population, inhuman acts and treatments, persecution and destruction of property.
On 19 April 2004, the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo decided to refer the situation in the DRC to the ICC. The Prosecutor opened an investigation in 23 June 2004 also involving cases against Thomas Lubanga Dyilo, Germain Katanga, Mathieu Ngudjolo Chui and Bosco Ntaganda.
On 20 August 2010, the Prosecution requested the Pre-Trial Chamber to issue an arrest warrant against Mbarushimana, who lived in Paris since 2002.
The Pre-Trial Chamber delivered an arrest warrant on 28 September 2010. On 11 October 2010 the French authorities arrested Callixte Mbarushimana in Paris and in 25 Juanuary 2011 he was transferred to the ICC detention centre in The Hague (he Netherlands).
