Miroslav Petkovic was a reserve police officer in Suva Reka, Kosovo during the 1999 war of Kosovo.
At noon on 26 March 1999, Petkovic – allegedly together with Radojko Repanovic, Radoslav Mitrovic, Nenad Jovanovic, Sladjan Cukaric, Milorad Nisavic, Miroslav Petkovic, Zoran Petkovic and Ramiz Papic – was summoned by Radojko Repanovic, chief police officer of the Suva Reka Police Unit in order to participate in the killing of Albanian citizens in the village of Suva Reka later that afternoon.
According to the indictments and witnesses that testified in the case, acting under the orders of Repanovic, Petkovic participated in encircling 50 Albanian civilians in a pizza restaurant called Calabraia on Cara Dushana Street in Suva Reka. Members of the attacking group threw hand grenades at the restaurant and shot those who were only wounded or fleeing. Inside the pizzeria were 49 members of the Berisha family but only one member survived. Among the dead were a one-year-old baby and a 100-year-old woman.
After the attack Petkovic participated in the loading of the killed civilians’ bodies onto a truck. The bodies were then transported and buried in a mass grave in Prizren.
The remains in the mass grave of 800 bodies were found and exhumed in 2001 after the fall of the regime of Slobodan Milosevic.
Petkovic along with seven other alleged perpetrators was indicted on 25 April 2005 for having committed war crimes against 50 Albanian civilians in the village of Suva Reka on 26 March 1999 during the Kosovo war.
