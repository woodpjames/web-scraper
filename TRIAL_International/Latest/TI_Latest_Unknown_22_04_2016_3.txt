Luciano Luberti was born in Rome on 25 April 1921. On 8 September 1943, whilst he was a Nazi supporter, Luberti decided to enter the Wehrmacht voluntarily. At this time, he already spoke fluent German.
The Wehrmacht assigned Luberti to the Albenga Police Station in Liguria where he was in charge of tracking down supporters and potential enemies. At the Albenga Police Station he worked in collaboration with Marshal Strupp and Captain Dosse, though there was no real hierarchy. At this time, the people from the Albenga region gave Luberti the nickname “Albenga’s executioner”. As a matter of fact, Luberti and his henchmen used torture, arbitrary arrests and sexual abuse as well as extrajudicial killings against supporters and civilians suspected of helping people who were resisting the Nazi regime.
On 25 April 1945, Luberti joined the 34th division of the infantry which was going from Piemont towards Germany. When he arrived in Turin, he secured false German documents and was hospitalized in order to remove a grenade splinter. However, Luberti was arrested by the Allies and imprisoned in Ivrea prison, but released on parole. Thanks to the help of Bruno Mantero, a supporter whose family had been victims of Luberti, he was finally captured in 1946 in Ventimiglia, where he had tried to escape to enrol himself in the Foreign Legion.
During his trial in 1946, the Allies accused Luberti of being responsible of the death of 200 or even 300 civilians during his time at the Albenga police station. Nevertheless, the court finally convicted him of the deaths of 59 civilians recovered in a mass grave in Centa.
