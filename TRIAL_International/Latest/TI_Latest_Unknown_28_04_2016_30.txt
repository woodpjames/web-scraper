Juan Nolberto Rivero Lazo was born on 5 December 1941, in Lima, Perú. In 1959 he entered to Chorrillos Military School and graduated on 1964. In January 1991, he was appointed General of the Peruvian Army and Chief of the Army Intelligence Direction (DINTE), position he held until 1992. Rivero Lazo and Vladimiro Lenin Montesinos Torres, security adviser of President Alberto Fujimori, were acquainted for a long time as both had belonged to the artillery and at the beginning of their careers worked in Arequipa. It is the reason why Montesinos supported Lazo´s designation at the head of the DINTE. In practice, Rivero acted as a subordinate of Montesinos.
On 22 August 1991, Rivero Lazo wrote a memorandum creating the “Grupo Colina”, a paramilitary armed squad joined to the National Intelligence Service (SIN) which operated under the knowledge of the Presidency of the Republic and the Army Command.
There were a close relation between the Chiefs of the DINTE and the SIN. DINTES´s intelligence production served both the Army and the SIN and Rivera Lazo performed daily meetings with Nicolás de Bari Hermoza Ríos, Commander General of the Army, and maintained a constant and direct relation with him. At the same time, he informed Montesinos Torres about his activities.
Grupo Colina was deemed to be responsible, among other things, for the execution of 15 civilians in 1991 in the Barrios Altos district of Lima, as well as for the disappearance of nine students and a professor from the University of La Cantuta in 1992, and for the abduction, torture and execution of Mariella Barreto, a former intelligence agent whose body was found beheaded in March 1997.
On 17 August 2005, on Callao Naval Base, the Lima Special Criminal Court I (Anti-corruption Chamber) began the trial against members of Grupo Colina accused of perpetrating the crimes of “La Cantuta” and “Barrios Altos”, among others serious crimes.
