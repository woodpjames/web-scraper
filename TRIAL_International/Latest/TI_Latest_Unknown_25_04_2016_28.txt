facts

Michael Seifert was born in Landau – a little town which today is part of Ukraine – on 16 March 1924. He was an SS corporal in charge of the Bolzano Transit Prison Camp in Northern Italy. He was dubbed the “butcher of Bolzano” because of the acts of homicide and torture he allegedly committed against the camp’s prisoners. Amongst other things, he let a 15 year old prisoner die of hunger, gouged a young man’s eyes out and tortured a woman before killing her and her daughter.
Seifert emigrated to Vancouver in Canada in 1951. He pretended to be Estonian and lied about his previous actions. He later obtained Canadian citizenship.
Seifert went unpunished for nearly 50 years, until in 1994 new documents were found in Italy about the crimes committed by the occupying power during World War II. In 1999, an Italian Prosecutor began proceedings against Seifert, of which he was immediately notified.
