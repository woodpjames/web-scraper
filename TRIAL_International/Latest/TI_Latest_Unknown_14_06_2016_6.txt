Vincent Otti was born around 1946 in the Gulu district of Uganda.
Otti was the second-in-command of the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA), a rebel group which terrorized the civilian population in Northern Uganda (see ”related cases”).
After the defection of the LRA’s main negotiator Sam Kolo, Otti became the main interlocutor in the peace talks with the government-supported mediator, former minister Betty Bigombe. From that point, the peace-process became bogged down.
In April 2005, in the course of a reorganisation of the LRA’s four brigades, Vincent Otti was reportedly promoted Lieutenant General of the LRA.
In the second half of September 2005, apparently under pressure from the Ugandan army, Otti led an incursion of a 400-troops-strong faction of the LRA into the Democratic Republic of Congo. According to Congolese government sources, Otti asked for political asylum.
At the beginning of October 2005, reports were leaked that the International Criminal Court had issued arrest warrants for five LRA leaders including Otti, and transmitted them to Uganda, the Congo and Sudan. Hopes for a quick arrest of Otti were however dashed when a few days later he and his forces were pushed back over the border into Sudan by a joint and massive deployment of troops by the Congolese army and the UN Mission in Congo (MONUC).
The Sudanese government has since vowed to apprehend any LRA leader ”to be found“ on its territory.
Based on a bilateral agreement with Sudan, the Ugandan government may pursue LRA rebels on Sudanese territory, but only up to a ”red line“, which is marked by an overland-road about 100 km into the country.
On 10 October however, the Ugandan government reported that Sudan had given them free reign, during one month, to pursue the LRA anywhere across the border.
