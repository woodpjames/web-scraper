facts

Marina Grubišić-Fejzić, born on 24 August 1967 in Čapljina, is a citizen of Bosnia and Herzegovina and currently resides in Ilidža. Throughout the conflict in the former Yugoslavia (from 1991 to1995), she was a member of the Croatian Defence Forces (HOS) and a guard at the Military Prison in Dretelj.
In a joint indictment with four other accused (and allegedly several other unnamed individuals), Grubišić-Fejzić has been accused of carrying out crimes against humanity between the months of May and August in 1992 at the Dretelj Military Prison. The indictment purports that the accused committed crimes against humanity and war crimes against several hundreds of incarcerated Serbs, mostly civilians that came from the areas surrounding the Dretelj camp. In the charges brought against her, Grubišić-Fejzić is co-accused of having kept the civilians in inhumane conditions, as they were mistreated, looted, beaten, raped, sexually abused, compelled to forced labour and tortured in a degrading manner.
This mistreatment resulted in the death of a great number of the detained persons, while others were displaced to unknown locations and are yet to be found. The remains of some of the victims were only located and exhumed after the war.
Grubišić-Fejzić has been charged with the commission of the criminal offence of crimes against humanity in violation of Article 172 in conjunction with Article 180 of the Criminal Code of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
