Sexual violence: the hidden face of the Burundian crisis
20.11.2018
Uta Simon recently served as gender advisor and investigator of sexual and gender-based violence on the UN Commission of Inquiry on Burundi. Among other things, she and her colleagues travelled to refugee camps to interview Burundian refugees. In an interview with TRIAL International, she reflected on her assignment and the challenges related to researching gender-based and sexual violence. 
“I have investigated human rights violations for much of the past 17 years and, from December 2017 to September 2018, joined a UN Commission of Inquiry documenting violations of human rights in Burundi. As the government did not allow us into the country, we conducted remote investigation activities and missions to neighboring countries to interview Burundian refugees.
Our research also included other forms of evidence-gathering, such as expert interviews, desk research, and analysis of publicly available information. All of these forms of research can contribute to corroborating information about human rights violations, in addition to interviewing survivors and witnesses.
Interviews were conducted in refugee camps in Tanzania, Rwanda, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, often in settings where people did not feel safe. Therefore, we took special care to establish trust and protect witnesses.
As an investigator, I have found it important to explain our mandate and methods of working. This ensures that people decide freely whether to speak with us and that they understand we cannot offer direct assistance.”
