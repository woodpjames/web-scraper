facts

Vinko Martinovic was born on 21 September 1963 in Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina. He was a commander in the HOS (Croatian Defence Forces) in Mostar in 1992. Subsequently, he became a member of the Convict’s Battalion (KB), in which he was a commander of the militia group “Mrmak”, later to be known as “Vinko Skrobo”. In this capacity, he was subordinate to Mladen Naletilic.
From April 1993 to February 1994, Martinovic allegedly took part in military operations under the command of the KB, the Croatian Defence Council (HVO) and the Army of the Republic of Croatia (HV).
On 9 May 1993, forces of the HV, the HVO and the KB launched a widespread military offensive against the Bosnian Muslim population in Mostar and against positions of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina (ABiH). During this entire period, the Bosnian Muslim population was targeted by a campaign of violence. The HVO and the HV heavily bombed Mostar, preventing the arrival of humanitarian aid and basic supplies. Mladen Naletilic, as commander of the KB, and Martinovic as commander of the “Mrmak” company, were allegedly responsible for this campaign.
Furthermore, between April 1993 and January 1994, Bosnian Muslims, both civilians and prisoners of war, were interned in detention centres, notably that of the Heliodrome, allegedly on orders from Mladen Naletilic and Martinovic. During their detention, the interned persons were allegedly subjected to torture by Mladen Naletilic, Martinovic and their subordinates. It was also alleged that between May 1993 and January 1994, the detainees were regularly taken to the front lines where they were used as human shields and forced to carry out various dangerous military support missions for the HV and the HVO.
