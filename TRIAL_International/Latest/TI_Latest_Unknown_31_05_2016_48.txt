facts

Khaled Ben Sa誰d was born on 29 October 1962 in Tunis.
In 1996, he was posted to the Jendouba police station in Tunisia.
Together with other agents of the Tunisian DST (Internal Security Department), he was accused of inflicting acts of torture and inhumane treatment on one of his female compatriots in order to force her to divulge information concerning her husband ( then in political asylum in France) who had been held and tortured in the same place in February 1991. He was also accused of torturing other persons suspected of belonging to a religious group.
On 11 October 1996, the victim was apprehended by four police officers in civilian clothes and held for two days at the Jendouba police station. The plaintiff confirmed on oath that during these two days she was subjected to humiliating acts and acts of torture (multiple blows to the head and body, suspension from a wooden beam placed between two tables, blows from truncheons, sexual violence, insults) by several torturers, one of whom was Khaled Ben Sa誰d.
After these events, Sa誰d was given a posting to the Tunisian Consulate in Strasbourg as Vice-Consul.
In April 2001, the victim, by then living in France with her husband, learned through the auspices of the Association of Victims of Torture in Tunisia, that Khaled Ben Sa誰d was in Strasbourg.
