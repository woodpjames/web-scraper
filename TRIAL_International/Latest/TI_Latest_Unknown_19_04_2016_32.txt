facts

Dragan Jokic was born on 20 August 1957 in the city of Zvornik, in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In July 1995, he was Chief of the Corps of Engineers in the Zvornik Brigade of the Bosnian Serb Army (Army of Republika Srpska â€“ VRS), with the rank of Commander.
From the morning of 14 July 1995 until that of the following day, Jokic was the officer on duty in the Zvornik Brigade. After the fall of the Srebrenica enclave, on 14 July a convoy of around thirty buses drove Bosnian Muslims to various detention centres in the Zvornik municipality. Between that same day and 16 July, they were blindfolded and taken to nearby fields, where they were executed. On 16 July, approximately 500 male Bosnian Muslims detained in the Pilica cultural centre were executed and buried in mass graves.
The Engineering Corps from Zvornik are reported to have repeatedly supplied the equipment and drivers necessary in the burial operations. Dragan Jokic is alleged to have provided the assistance of his Corps by knowing that killings had been carried out on a large scale and that the materiel was necessary to prepare mass graves. Moreover, Jokic himself allegedly coordinated communications between members of the VRS carrying out the massacre and participated himself in the organisation of the burial. He also reportedly transmitted reports and regular updates to his superiors concerning the progress of the operation underway.
