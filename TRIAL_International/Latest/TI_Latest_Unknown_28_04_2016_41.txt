The convey stopped in a wooden area where the military-aged non-Serb men were separated from the women, children and elderly. The group of non-Serb men were then driven to a location called Korecanske Stijene. Prisoners were ordered to leave the bus with their heads down and to kneel at the edge of the cliff.
