facts

Awad Hamed Al-Bandar was born in 1945. He was the chief justice of the Iraqi Revolutionary Court.
Al-Bandar was involved, together with Saddam Hussein and six other senior officials (Barzan Ibrahim Al-Tikriti, Taha Yassin Ramadan, Abdullah Kadem Rouaid, Ali Daeem Ali, Mohammed Azzam al-Ali, Mezhar Abdullah Rouaid), for the Dujail massacre.
The slaughter was a retaliation for the attack on the presidential motorcade on 8 July 1982, while Saddam was visiting Al Dujail. This village was a stronghold of the Shiite Dawa Party, which carried out terrorist attacks in Iraq to protest against the war with Shiite Iran. When Saddam Husseinâ€™s motorcade entered the city, the Dawa members opened fire. A four-hour battle ensued. Saddam Hussein was saved by soldiers and army helicopters.
In the months following the failed assassination attempt, almost 800 Shiite people from Al Dujail were arrested and held in detention. Many were subject to torture. 143 Dujail residents were sentenced to death by the Revolutionary Court presided by Al Bandar. More than 40 detainees died during interrogation or while in detention from torture, malnutrition, lack of access to medical care and poor hygienic conditions. At least 96 were executed on 23 March 1985. Other 400 detainees, mostly family members of the 148 who had admitted involvement in the assassinate attempt, were sent into exile.
