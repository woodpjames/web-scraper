facts 

Neđo Ikonić was born in Visoko. In February 2009, following a complex multi-national and multi-jurisdictional investigation undertaken by the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), a Federal District Court in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, handed down a twelve month prison sentence to Nedjo Ikonić who had previously pleaded guilty to two counts of visa fraud.
In September 2006, ICE opened an investigation after receiving information from investigators of the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) that Nedjo Ikonić, the former commander of a Special Police Company of the Republika Srpska, may be present in the United States.
ICE, working in concert with the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Milwaukee, and investigators from both the ICTY and the Office of the Prosecutor of the State Court in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, determined that Ikonić obtained admission into the United States by fraudulently omitting his police service during the 1992-1995 conflict in Bosnia when applying to enter the United States as a refugee. He was charged and arrested in December 2006.
Ikonić, former Commander of the Second Company of the Jahorina Training Center with the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Republika Srpska, is suspected of having participated in the forcible resettlement of civilians and the murder of male civilians from Srebrenica in July 1995. The company which Ikonić commanded is alleged to have participated in the capture and killing of hundreds of Bosnian prisoners following the fall of the United Nations designated safe-area of Srebrenica in July 1995.
Nedjo Ikonić was arrested in the United States on the basis of an international arrest warrant issued in December 2008 and extradited to Bosnia on 13 January 2010.
