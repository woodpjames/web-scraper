facts

Jesús Muñecas Aguilar was born on 6 January 1939 in Daroca in Zaragoza, Spain.
During the 1939-1975 regime of General Francisco Franco, Muñecas Aguilar was a member of the Spanish Civil Guard, serving from 1961 until 1983. He was expelled from the Guard for his participation in Spain’s 1981 coup attempt, when 200 members of the Civil Guard took parliament and lawmakers hostage. He was subsequently sentenced to five years in prison for his role in the coup attempt.
In 2012, Muñecas Aguilar was accused of torture by the brother of his alleged victim. The torture allegedly took place in the Basque region town of Zarautz, Spain in 1968. The suit was presumably filed in an Argentinean court because a 1977 Spanish amnesty law prevents Spain’s courts from trying political crimes committed between 1936 and 1977, two years following the death of General Franco and end of his regime.
In 2012, the Argentinean court issued an international warrant for Muñecas Aguilar’s arrest under the principle of universal jurisdiction.
