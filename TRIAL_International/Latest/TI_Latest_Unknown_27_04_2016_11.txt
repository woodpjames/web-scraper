facts

Erna Pfannenstiel Wallisch, the daughter of a postal clerk, was born in 1922. She joined the Nazi party as a teenager and became a guard at the Ravensbruck women’s concentration camp near Berlin, for a year before she was transferred to the Majdanek concentration camp in Lublin, Poland. There, she met a Nazi guard, Georg Wallisch, and married him in 1944.
Former inmates, whose testimony has been gathered in an attempt to bring justice for her victims, allege that Wallisch used violence and illegal threats for reasons of race and nationality, against women and children so as to weaken them physically and psychologically.
She used to rank number seven on the Simon Wiesenthal Centre’s list of Nazi war criminals still at large.
Wallish was investigated for her crimes in the 1970s but discharged for lack of evidence.
