TRIAL acts before the Committee on Enforced Disappearances
01.05.2014
In May 2014 TRIAL and 8 associations from Mexico and Central America submitted an alternative report to the UN Committee on Enforced Disappearances (CED). It concerns the implementation by Mexico of its obligations under the International Convention on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. Mexico is a party to this treaty since 18 March 2008 and it must adopt a number of measures to fully implement it. Much remains to be done, while enforced disappearances continue being perpetrated in the country.
