Facts

Mohammed bin Salman was born in 1985. He obtained a law degree from King Saud University. He served as an adviser to the Council of Ministers for two years in 2007. In 2009, he became special adviser to his father, who was governor of Riyadh at the time. On 23 January 2015, after his father acceded to the throne, he was appointed Minister of Defence. The same year, he was named deputy crown prince. He became crown Prince and vice-prime minister on 21 June 2017.
On 25 March 2015, an international coalition led by Saudi Arabia launched air strikes against the armed group of Houthis in Yemen, triggering a major armed conflict. For three years, Yemen has been ravaged by a war that has already killed more than 10’000 people, half of whom are civilians.
Mohammed bin Salman was appointed Minister of Defense on 23 January 2015. One of his first acts was to launch the military campaign in Yemen along with other Arab states.
UN bodies and Human Rights groups have denounced the widespread violations of human rights and humanitarian law committed in Yemen. Alleged violations include deliberately targeting civilians, the use of illegal cluster-munitions, indiscriminate airstrikes and a naval blockade which deprived civilians of access to basic necessities.
The complaint alleges that certain attacks on civilian targets constitute violations of the 1984 Convention against Torture. These include the destruction of an Oxfam warehouse containing humanitarian supplies on the 18 April 2015; airstrikes on a wedding ceremony on 28 September 2015, which killed 131 civilians; on 26 October 2015, an attack on an MSF hospital, the GPS coordinates of which were known to the coalition; and the bombing of a funeral hall in Sana’a on 8 October 2016, which resulted in dozens of civilian casualties.
