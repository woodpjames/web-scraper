Srecko Popovic, former member of Serbian paramilitary group Jackals also called “Sakali”, was accused of having participated in the massacres in Cuska and Zahac committed in the late 1990s during the war in Kosovo.
On 13 March 2010, Popovic was accused of war crimes by the Serbian Special Court. He was accused of taking part in the massacre in Cuska, a Kosovan village with a majority Albanian population, not far from the town of Pec.
He was charged for the acts committed by the Serbian security forces, the Yugoslav army and paramilitaries on 14 May 1999 on an entirely civilian population. Women and children were separated from the men, and the soldiers and paramilitaries looted the houses of the inhabitants, also destroying their identity documents. The men were then divided into three groups of ten people and taken to three different houses where they were killed with an automatic rifle. The soldiers and paramilitaries then burned the houses. A total of 41 civilians between ages 19 to 69 years were killed that day.
On 13 March 2010, Serbia’s Office of the War Crimes Prosecutor had arrested nine suspects from the Jackals group, including Popovic, for the massacre in Cuska.
