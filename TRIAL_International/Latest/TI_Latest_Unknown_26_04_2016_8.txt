Kelbessa Negewo was born in Western Ethiopia in 1950.
In 1974, a socialist and military dictatorship led by Mengistu Hailé Mariam took the power in the country. After having abolished the multiparty system, in 1977 Mengistu’s government began the Red Terror, a campaign of terror against its supposed enemies of the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Party, a competing Marxist-Leninist group.
During the Red Terror, Kelbessa Negewo became an official of the Marxist Derg regime and was president of Zone 9, one of the 25 governmental administrative units in which the military junta had divided Addis Ababa. He allegedly oversaw the torture of political opponents and massacres carried out under orders from the new regime. He allegedly supervised and participated in the interrogations and torture of three women, who were questioned, beaten, threatened and ordered to undress during their illegal detention. It has also been reported that he was involved in recruiting members of the “revolutionary defence squads”, special units responsible for the deaths, detention, extrajudicial executions, shootings, and acts of torture inflicted on civilians, most of whom were students.
After having been imprisoned by the Ethiopian regime in the early eighties, Kelbessa Negewo fled to the United States on 3 August 1987 with a student visa issued by the American embassy in Addis Ababa. Six months later, he proclaiming himself an opponent of the Mengistu regime, he was granted political asylum and obtained the American citizenship on 28 July 1995.
In 1990, Kelbessa Negewo was recognized by one of his victims.
