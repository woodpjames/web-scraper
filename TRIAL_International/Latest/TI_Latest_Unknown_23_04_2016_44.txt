facts

Ernest Gakwaya is an ethnic Rwandan, who acquired Belgian nationality.
Gakwaya allegedly participated in the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, during which about 800.000 Rwandans, mainly Tutsis, were killed.
He allegedly was a member of the Interahamwe, a Hutu paramilitary organization, which carried out the Genocide acts against the Tutsis in 1994. The members killed thousands of people by machetes and clubs and installed road blocks at crucial points, where they killed Tutsis, who were trying to flee.
According to the Rwandan newspaper “New Times” Gakwaya was one of the Interahamwe most active during the genocide.
Despite his alleged role in the Rwandan Genocide, Gakwaya participated in the “Come and See-program” in Rwanda in December 2010, a reconciliation-program arranged by the Rwandan government. The invitation of Gakwaya by the Rwandan government caused demonstrations organized by survivors of the genocide.
On 23 March 2011 Gakwaya was arrested along with Emmanuel Nkunzuwimye in Belgium and charged with genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.
