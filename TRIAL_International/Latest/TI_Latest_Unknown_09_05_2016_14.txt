Galib Hadzic, a Bosnian, was the Crime Police Inspector at the Public Safety Station in Brcko during the autumn of 1992 in the midst of the Yugoslav Civil War. His position fell under the umbrella of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Ministry of Internal Affairs.
In this role, Hadzic physically abused, tortured, and treated inhumanely Serbian prisoners of war and Serbian civilians from the Bukvik area of Bosnia and Herzegovina on multiple occasions during 1992 and 1993. Most of these offenses occurred at detention centres established in schools, cooperative housing, and other facilities in and around Bukvik. Hadzic helped maintain poor conditions in the centres. Prisoners were forced to lie on the floor and inadequately fed.
Specific abuses carried out by Hadzic include but are not limited to the following: on one occasion during autumn 1992, Hadzic broke a prisonerâ€™s arm and both of his legs then withheld medical treatment from him; in another instance, Hadzic repeatedly punched a prisoner named Pavo Radic, whom he held in a garage, in the face and body while interrogating him about military units and armaments; separately, Hadzic reportedly beat a prisoner named Djoko Majdancevik. Hadzic was also known to single out prisoners for beatings.
During the autumn of 1992 at Gornji Rahic, Hadzic and an accomplice, Nijaz Hodzic, lined up prisoners and hit them in the face, including one prisoner named Borislav Piperac.
Hadzic was indicted on 15 November 2010.
