facts

Thadée Kwitonda was born in 1963. He moved to Butare during the early massacres of April 1994. There, he held the position of Deputy Secretary General of the National Bank of Rwanda (BNR). It is in this town that he would have participated and organized massacres against the Tutsis. However, he is also suspected of having committed abuses in the Ruhengeri prefecture, in Nyakabanda.
Kwitonda has supposedly left Rwanda after the 1994 massacres. After having lived for three years in a refugee camp in the Democratic Republic of Congo, he went to Belgium, in Brussels, where he lived as a refugee from 1997 to 2000. After this period, he sought and obtained the Belgian nationality.
Kwitonda served as defense investigator at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) from June 1999 to July 2001. During this period, he has worked for Arsène Shalom Ntahobali, accused of having been one of the leaders of the Interahamwe militias during the genocide. Following an investigation on his role during the genocide initiated by the Office of the Prosecutor of the ICTR, Kwitonda’s contract was suspended by the Registrar of the Tribunal in July 2001, pending the results of the investigation against him. Kwitonda refuted the charges, citing past investigations conducted by the Belgian immigration services during his application for citizenship in 2000.
A preliminary investigation has been opened against Kwitonda in 2006 in Belgium by the investigating judge Damien Vandermeersch.
