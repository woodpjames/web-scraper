Facts

Ahmed Hamdane Mahmoud Ayach El Aswadi was born on 15 April 1984 in Samarra, Iraq.
In 2014, El Aswadi was imprisoned in Tikrit for terrorist acts before the Islamic State organization attacked the city. He reportedly fled the prison where he was detained and left the city towards Erbil. A year later, in August 2015, he left Erbil for Turkey. After two months in Turkey he reportedly arrived in Europe, passing through Greece, Hungary and Germany.
The Iraqi authorities say, however, that the Islamic State organization reportedly released El Aswadi during the capture of the city and that he joined the organization in 2014 and participated in the massacre of hundreds of people, mostly Shiite in Tikrit.
El Aswadi arrived in France during the summer of 2016 when he applied to the French Office for the Protection of Refugees and Stateless Persons (Ofpra) for political refugee status, which he obtained in June 2017. This status was withdrawn after his arrest.
