Jovica Štanišić was born on 30 July 1950 in Ratkovo, Republic of Serbia.
In 1975, Štanišić joined the State Security Service (DB) of Serbia’s Ministry of Internal Affair. From 31 December 1991 to 27 October 1998, he served as DB’s Chief although he de facto headed the DB before his official date of appointment and throughout 1991.

Between 1 April 1991 and 31 December 1995, DB’s forces took control over villages and town in the Serb-controlled areas of Croatia and BiH and a large number of non-Serbs civilians were subjected to extreme violence, killed or forcibly deported in the Serb-controlled areas of Croatia and BiH.
