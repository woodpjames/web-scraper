facts 

Stevan Todorovic was born on 29 December 1957.On 17 April 1992, he was appointed Police Chief of the Municipality of Bosanski Samac after the military took over power. He also became a member of the “Crisis Cell of the Serbian Municipality of Bosanski Samac”, an executive body peremptorily instituted by the Serbs in July 1992.
Todorovic was indicted for planning, instigating and ordering, in collusion with other political figures, a campaign of persecutions between 1 September and 31 December 1993, whose aim it was to get rid of the non- Serbian population living in the Municipalities of Bosanski Samac and Odzak. The Serbian authorities in so doing arrested and imprisoned a large number of individuals and forced many civilians to abandon their homes. They also disseminated discriminatory rules and regulations concerning the non-Serbs, insisted that the great majority of them be put into forced labour and undertook a large scale appropriation of their personal and commercial property. In carrying out this project, Stevan Todorovic reportedly committed serious violations of international humanitarian law. Most notably he was said to have committed murder, acts of torture and pillage.
Before 17 April 1992, the Municipality of Bosanski Samac was made up of close to 17’000 Muslims and Croatians living in Bosnia against an overall population of around 33’000. In May 1995, there remained less than 300.
Stevan Todorovic was arrested on 27 September 1998 by the SFOR (NATO Stabilisation Force) and transferred on the same day to the ICTY (International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia).
