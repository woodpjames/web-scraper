facts

François Bazaramba was born in Rwanda in 1951. He earned a master’s degree from Cameroon.
At the time of the genocide, he was a pastor in the Baptist church in the community Nyakizu in the Southern Province. Bazaramba had no formal managerial position in the administration of the town of Nyakizu in the Maraba sector. He was however an active member of the MDR Power (Republican Democratic Movement), representing the Hutu extremists, national director of the youth wing of the Union of Baptist Churches in Rwanda (UEBR), director of an educational institution Technical Vocational located in the Maraba sector and head of the refugee camp named Karamba which was founded by the United Nations for the security of Hutu refugees from Rwanda and Burundi. He was appointed to this role by Ladislas Ntaganzwa, mayor of the town of Nyakizu. His wife was the director of a local health center. Bazaramba enjoyed considerable public influence in the Maraba sector.
During the course of the events, he is believed to have planed and carried out the massacre of more than 5’000 persons who were trying to run away from the atrocities.
In 2003, Bazaramba arrived in Finland, where he sought asylum. Since then, he has been living in the town of Porvoo, some 50 kilometers east of Helsinki, the capital. In April 2007, he was put in detention, according to an order of the District Court of Porvoo, while the National Bureau of Investigation carried out an investigation on allegations of war crimes.
In February 2009, Finland dismissed the request of Rwandan authorities to extradite Bazaramba to Rwanda, fearing that he would not receive a fair trial.
On 1 June 2009, after a long investigation, the Finnish General Prosecutor Office charged Bazaramba with genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.
