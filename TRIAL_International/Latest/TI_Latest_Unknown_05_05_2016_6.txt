Velibor Bogdanovic was born on 31 December 1970. During the war in former Yugoslavia, Bogdanovic resided in Mostar, a municipality which was the scene of an armed conflict between the Croatian Defence Council (HVO) and the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Bogdanovic was a member of the HVO.
On the night of 25 to 26 May 1993, Bogdanovic and five unidentified armed soldiers went to the apartment of a couple, Salko and Mina Zerem. Two soldiers took Salko Zerem outside the building by force and put him a car. Meanwhile, Bogdanovic and the two other men ransacked the apartment and stole valuables as well as money. Bogdanovic then took Mina Zerem to a room and raped her threatening her with a gun. Leaving the building, Bogdanovic and the other members of the HVO drove Salko Zerem to the detention center of the “Heliodrom camp” from which he would be transferred to other prisons and detained for a total period of 30 days.
In November 2010, Bogdanovic was charged with war crimes against civilians for the acts he committed on the night of 25 to 26 May 1993.
