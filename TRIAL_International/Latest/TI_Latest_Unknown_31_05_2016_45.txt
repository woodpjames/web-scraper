In June 1992 the Serbs took over power in Vrbanjci, a municipality in northern Bosnia. Djuradj Kusljic, a Bosnian Serb, was appointed chief of the police station. He also occupied a leading position in the local army contingent.
In the same month, the Serbs started terrorizing the Muslim population. The aim was to drive women and children away, and to kill or detain the male population.
Kusljic knew that this campaign – which he supervised as a commander – was designed to exterminate parts of the Bosnian Muslim population, and to exile the rest. He ordered his subordinates to kill six Muslims in the vicinity of a sawmill, and took part in the killings himself. In August 1992, Djuradj Kusljic supervised the expulsion of the Muslim population from the town of Dabovci.
However, his direct involvement in the killing of 18 men, which happened in this context, could not be proven.
