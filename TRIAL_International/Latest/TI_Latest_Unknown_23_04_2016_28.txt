Jovica Tadic, nicknamed Tajo, is a Bosnian man and former member of the Srpska Republican Army. Whilst under this office he was accused of having committed war crimes.
On 23 September 1992, then placed under the command of Djuro Tadic, and along with seven other Srpske Republican Army members, Tadic allegedly participated in the attack of a group of 18 to 25 Bosnian civilians in the village of Dujci, near the town of Bihać, situated in the North West of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
According to witnesses, the armed men – including Tadic – arrived with two vehicles on site, where the Bosnian civilians were in the process of collecting prunes, within the framework of a penal servitude program that was imposed by Bihac municipality, then under siege of Serbian Forces. Equipped with automatic guns, dressed in police or military uniforms, with their faces covered by balaclavas, the group is alleged to have run around the civilians and opened fire.
One man went over to the bodies and stabbed them with a knife. The bodies were then doused in petrol, set on fire and moved in order to cover up the crime. When Tadic and the others realised that some civilians had hidden themselves in a farm near the road, they threw a grenade at the farm.
Quite a few of those who were working on the site successfully fled to a neighbouring hill and then crossed the river Drina by swimming, in order to seek refuge in Croatia.
In total, seven victims were able to be identified by DNA analysis. The other bodies still have not been recovered. The majority of the victims were women and elderly people. There was also a young girl aged 13.
On 15 September 2011 Tadic was arrested, then sentenced in February 2012 to 12 months in prison by the Bihac District Court for war crimes.
