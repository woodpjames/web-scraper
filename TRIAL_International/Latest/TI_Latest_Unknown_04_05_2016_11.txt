facts

Milan Babic was born on 26 February 1956 in Kukar Croatia. He was a married man with two children and was a dentist by profession.
By February 1990, Milan Babic had become an influential political personality in the Serbian Democratic Party (SDS) in Croatia. He held top positions on the Municipal Committee of the SDS in Knin. In February 1991, he began to extol the creation of an independent Serb state in the “Autonomous Serbian Region of Krajina”. During the summer of the same year, Milan Babic assumed the position of Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces in the self proclaimed autonomous region. Finally, in December 1991, he became President of the “Serbian Republic of Krajina” In other words, during the overall period under consideration below, he was one of the highest ranking and the most influential of the Serbian political leaders in the region.
During the period between, approximately, 1 August 1991 and 15 February 1992, Serbian Forces attacked towns, villages and localities within the Autonomous Serb Entity (“SAO”) of Krajina and gained overall control.
Thereafter, in collaboration with the local Serbian authorities, the Serb Forces instituted a system of persecutions aimed at forcing the Croatian civilian population and other non-Serb civilian populations out of these areas. These persecutions, of a political, racial or religious nature, came in various forms:
– extermination or murder of hundreds of Croatian civilians and other non-Serb civilians;
– imprisonment and prolonged and systematic detention of several hundreds of Croatian civilians and other non-Serb civilians under inhumane conditions;
– expulsion or forced transfer of thousands of Croatian civilians and other non-Serb civilians;
– deliberate destruction of housing, other public or private property, cultural institutions, historical monuments and places of worship belonging to the Croatian population and other non-Serb populations.
The aim of these acts was to banish, for once and for all, the majority of the Croatian population and other non-Serb populations from around one third of the Croatian territory in order to create there a State ruled over by the Serbs. These acts began approximately around 1 August 1991 and continued at least up until June 1992, a date beyond that covered by the indictment, which only took into account the period up to 15 February 1992.
Milan Babic, by his own admission, acknowledged that between August 1991 and February 1992, he had contributed to the persecution of the Croatian and non-Serb populations in the following manner:
– He devised and upheld a policy aimed at attaining the objective of the common criminal enterprise whose aim it was to expel definitively the majority of the Croatian population and other non-Serb populations from around one third of the territory of Croatia and, in addition, he participated in and drove forward the development and execution of this policy.
– He took an active part in the creation, support and maintenance of the organisms which ruled over the “Autonomous Serbian Region of Krajina” and which pursued the objective of the common criminal enterprise.
– He contributed to the reorganisation and the recruitment of the Territorial Defence Forces (“TO”) which took part in the crimes committed.
– He worked closely with the head of the “Martic Police Force” which he acknowledged was implicated in the crimes committed.
– He contributed towards the financial, material, logistical and political support necessary to gain control over the territories by the armed forces.
– He requested the help of the Yugoslav People’s Army (“JNA”) or facilitated their intervention in order to establish and maintain control over the territories.
– He made speeches of such a nature as to inflame feelings of ethnic hostility during public gatherings and in front of the media, thereby unleashing the surge of violence against the Croatian and non-Serb populations.
-Finally, he urged and facilitated the acquisition of arms and their distribution to the Serbs in order to accomplish the campaign of persecutions.
Milan Babic, knowingly and willingly took part in the campaign of persecutions. He was well aware of the crimes being carried out as listed in the indictment, such as the inhumane treatment in the prisons, the expulsions, forced transfers and destruction of property.
With respect to the murders listed, Milan Babic knew that civilians had been killed during the expulsion of the non-Serbs and that these murders were a foreseeable consequence of the campaign of persecutions. Nevertheless, he continued to maintain that he had no knowledge of the various crimes listed in the indictment.
Moreover, Milan Babic acknowledged that the crime of persecution was within the context of a common criminal enterprise to which he had greatly contributed in his role as co-conspirator.
Milan Babic voluntarily gave himself up to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in November 2003.
