Iraq: No Impunity for Enforced Disappearances
03.12.2012
The International Commission on Missing Persons (ICMP), “Amnesty International” and “TRIAL – Track Impunity Always”, published a set of joint recommendations calling on the Government of Iraq to take decisive steps to tackle and end the practice of enforced disappearance in Iraq.
The recommendations are the direct outcome of a conference, ‘No Impunity for Enforced Disappearances’ held by the ICMP in cooperation with the Iraqi Ministry of Human Rights in Baghdad, 16 and 17 September 2012 (link to press release).
With the accession to the Convention for the Protection of All Persons against Enforced Disappearance in 2010, the Government of Iraq is committed to tackle and combat the crime of enforced disappearance. The recommendations may serve as a basis for the relevant government agencies to enhance access to justice, truth and full reparation for victims of enforced disappearance. The document also aims to encourage international agencies to offer support to the Government of Iraq in its efforts to apply the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance in domestic legislation.
The recommendations will be distributed to media and among relevant Iraqi agencies, International Embassies in Iraq and international human rights organizations.
