Azharul Islam was the Rangpur district unit president of Islami Chhatra Sangha (now Islami Chhatra Shibir), the student wing of the Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami during the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971. Supposedly, he was also the Rangpur district commander of the Al-Badr bahini, a paramilitary wing of the West Pakistani Army. After the Liberation War, Islam fled to Pakistan but returned to Bangladesh in 1975 after the killing of the Bangladeshi former President and Prime Minister Sheik Mujibur Rahman, also called Bangabandhu (“friend of Bangladesh”).
In 1977, Islam re-joined Jamaat-e-Islami, the largest Islamist political party in Bangladesh and became the first president of University of Dhaka branch of Bangladesh Islami Chhatra Shibir. Currently he is the acting Secretary General of Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami.
Islam, as the Rangapur district unit president of Islami Chhatra Sangha and the alleged leader of Al-Badr, is accused of involvement in crimes against humanity committed during the Bangladesh Liberation War in collaboration with Pakistan occupation army and its auxiliary forces. It is alleged that Islam had direct involvement in the mass killing of 1,200 unarmed Bangalees in Jharua Bil and Padda Pukur area in Rangpur district during the Liberation War.
Islam was also allegedly involved in murder, rape, torture, confinement, loot, arson and forced conversion to Islam. He is also said to have been involved in the killing of intellectuals, cultural personalities, physicians and lawyers in different areas of Rangpur district during the war.
On 15 April 2012, an investigation into allegations of crimes against humanity committed by Islam started.
