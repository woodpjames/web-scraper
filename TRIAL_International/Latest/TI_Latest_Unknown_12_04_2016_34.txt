facts 

Anton Malloth was born on 13 February 1912 in Innsbruck to an unmarried mother. He grew up in foster care in Schenna close to Meran in South Tyrol. Malloth completed an apprenticeship as a butcher.
In 1933, Malloth was recruited by the Italian Army and served for 18 month in Siena as part of the Bersaglieri infantry. After his return he worked for four years in a wine store in Meran, up until he got recruited again. When Hitler in 1939 gave up South Tyrol to Italy, Malloth opted for the German citizenship. He was subsequently called up by the German Wehrmacht and was trained at a police academy and later on sent to Prague as a prison guard.
On 2 June 1940, Malloth took up a post as a prison guard in the Gestapo prison Kleine Festung Theresienstadt in Litomerice, in todays Czech Republic, which was under the command of Heinrich Jöckel. At least 2500 people lost their lives in this notorious prison – mainly Jews and Czech resistance fighters. On 8 May 1945, the Red Army liberated the inmates of the prison. Malloth managed to escape and flee to Tyrol.
During the next 50 years, several attempts were made to bring Malloth to justice for his crimes committed at Kleine Festung Theresienstadt. The Austrian Police arrested Malloth for the first time on 29 December 1947.
