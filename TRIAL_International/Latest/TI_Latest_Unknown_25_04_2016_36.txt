Jugoslav Misljenovic was born in 1968.
After the war broke out in Croatia in 1990, the Yugoslav National Army (JNA), together with paramilitary formations, surrounded the village of Miklusevci and nearby places after 8 October 1991. They organised an authority called the “Serbian autonomous area Krajina”. In Miklusevci an important base of the territorial defence was formed and imposed itself as the local authority. Misljenovic was a member of the Milusevci base.From 14 October 1991 until 18 May 1992, the Miklusevci territorial defence allegedly attempted to expel all non-Serbs from the area.
During this period, Misljenovic and other members of the territorial defence allegedly committed numerous violations of international humanitarian law, including confiscation of property, inhumane treatment, looting, intimidation, destruction of property, causing serious pain and suffering to civilians, murder, and forced labour. This was allegedly done with the aim of expelling non-Serbs.
Misljenovic was suspected of: being one of the persons to introduce police hour for all non-Serb villagers, with special passes allowing them to move in the village; forced labour consisting of logging and field work; participating in expelling 98 villagers of non-Serb ethnicity; throwing smoke bombs in the villagers’ yards to make them leave their houses in the night from 17 to 18 May 1992, and the day after forcing them to sign the papers according to which they would leave all of their property to the “Serbian autonomous area Krajina” authorities.
Misljenovic was also suspected of searching civilian houses, beating the villagers while questioning them and threatening the villagers.
On 29 April 1996, District Attorney’s Office in Osijek in Croatia filed an indictment against Misljenovic and 34 other suspects for the alleged crimes that occurred in Miklusevci.
