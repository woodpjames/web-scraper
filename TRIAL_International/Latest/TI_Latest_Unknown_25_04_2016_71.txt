facts

Momčilo Mandić, a Bosnian Serb, was born on 1 May 1954 in Kalinovik in Bosnia-Herzegovina. He is a qualified lawyer and is married with two children.
At the start of 1992, Momčilo Mandić joined the government of Republika Srpska (RS), an administration that self-proclaimed in January 1992 and that was dominated by Bosnian Serbs. Mandić was Deputy Minister for the Interior when, in April 1992, the conflict erupted between the armed forces of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the military and police of RS in Sarajevo.
The charges against Mandić were that, in his capacity as Deputy Minister for the Interior, he had played a role in the attack on the Interior Ministry Staff Training Centre in the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, which took place on the first day of the war, on 6 April 1992. The training centre was in Vraca, south of Sarajevo. Mandić is accused of having transferred all staff and students of Bosnian and Croatian origin to the Vraca Community Centre following the attack.
One group was transported to Pale where they were interrogated, mistreated and imprisoned until 10 April 1992, when they were exchanged and handed over in Sarajevo.
Then, as Justice Minister in RS, Mandić was accused of persecuting non-Serbian civilians in Sarajevo and in the town of Foča. During his term in office, a number of civilians were detained illegally and persecuted in correctional penal institutions (detention camps) that were under the authority of the Ministry for Justice in Ilitža and Foča.
On 19 August 2005, Mandić was arrested following charges of assisting Radovan Karadzic in his escape. Arrested in Montenegro, Mandić was extradited to Bosnia-Herzegovina and detained there.
