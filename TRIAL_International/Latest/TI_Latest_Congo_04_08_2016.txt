Congolese soldier receives 15 years sentence for double rape
04.08.2016
A military tribunal in Bukavu sentenced private Bolingo Katusi to 15 years imprisonment for the rape of two women in the village of Mukoloka, in the East of the Democratic Republic of Congo.
As night gathered on 14 September 2013, Mrs Sylvie and Yvette (pseudonyms) prepared to go to sleep in their respective rooms of their common house. Yvette was attending to her baby boy.
Taking advantage of the menâ€™s absence, private Bolingo Katusi broke into their house threatening the two women with his rifle. He forced himself on Sylvie and Yvette, who tried to resist him. During the fight, her baby boy fell to the ground. He succumbed to his injuries within days.
Bolingo Katusi is a soldier in the Congolese military, deployed in Mukoloka a few months earlier to free the area of the armed group Raiya Mutomboki, itself sowing terror among the civilian population. Stories of abuse perpetrated against citizens by those supposed to protect them are sadly common in the region.
