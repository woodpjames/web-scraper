facts

Tomislav Duic was born on 30 August 1969. During the period covered in the indictment, he was Commandant of the Lora military prison camp in Split (Croatia). Between March and September 1992, he himself, and seven of his colleagues, namely Davor Banic, Anto Gudic, Andelko Botic, Tonce Vrkic, Miljenko Bajic , Josip Bikic andEmilio Bungur, all of whom were members of the 72nd Company of the Croatian Military Police, were said to have tortured and killed two Serb civilians from Croatia, and also to have tortured several other Serb civilian prisoners of war, in the Lora military prison.
During the second half of the nineties, human rights activists began to condemn mass arrests and imprisonment in Lora of hundreds of civilians and Serb soldiers who were suspected of preparing an “armed rebellion against Croatia”, as well as some Croat soldiers, all of whom were declared to be “enemies of the Republic”.
This was one of the more sombre episodes of the 1991-1995 Croatian war of Independence. The victims, who were, for the most part, members of the Yugoslav’s Peoples Army (JNA), stated that they had been subjected to frequent and cruel torture.
For example, Vojkan Zivkovic was reported to have been electrocuted and to have had his fingers cut off.
Milance Tosic was also said to have been electrocuted, burnt with cigarettes, then forced to sing popular Croatian national songs.
As for Miroslav Petrovic, he was reportedly forced to drink salted water before being exposed to the heat of the sun for hours on end. Other witnesses testified that they had been deprived of food and water or that they had been subjected to many hours of beatings.
Seven of those under indictment were arrested in September 2001.
The prime suspect, Tomislav Duic, is still at large.
