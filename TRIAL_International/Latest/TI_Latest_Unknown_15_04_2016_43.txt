Kahro Vejzovic was born on 23 May 1970 in Tarevo, Kladanj Municipality, Bosnia and Herzegovina [Former Yugoslavia].
Vejzovic was a Police Officer at the Lukavac Police Station, Tuzla Municipality, and later a member of the Stupari Police Station in Stupari, Ladanj Municipality.
The Indictment alleges that Vejzovic unlawfully detained and tortured Serb civilians in Stupari from the beginning of June 1992 through the end of August 1992 and in January 1993, during the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the armed conflict between the Republika Srpska Army and Members of the Territorial Defense of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Vejzovic is accused of acting both alone and in concert with other police officers of the Stupari Police Station.
The Indictment alleges that Vejzovic and other Stupari police officers detained Serb civilians in Stupari’s education workers’ buildings and in the former Stupari Local Office, as well as occasionally in buildings in the nearby villages of Olovici and Lupoglavo. Detainees were allegedly guarded by police officers, could only leave their place of detention for one daily 15-minute walk, and lacked adequate food.
According to the Indictment and trial witnesses, Vejzovic allegedly interrogated and tortured the unlawfully detained civilians by beating them, hitting them with fists, boots, batons, rifle butts, and a wooden hammer, putting a gun and a knife under their throats, and threatening them. On one occasion, Vejzovic allegedly broke a civilian’s tooth and forced him to swallow it and extinguished a cigarette on another civilian’s tongue. Allegedly, after being tortured one civilian killed himself for fear of being tortured again.
The Indictment alleges that Vejzovic, while beating the unlawfully detained Serb civilians, cursed them and said, “I am hitting you because you are a Serb…we’ll drive you all out across the Drina.”
Vejzovic was arrested on 22 February 2013.
