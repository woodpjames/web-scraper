TRIAL and the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) will present on Wednesday 11 September 2013 their latest publication entitled «Promoting  Accountability through the Human Rights Bodies in Geneva».
What are the potentials of Geneva-based human rights bodies in the fight against impunity? How can these bodies better promote the liability of individuals and of States responsible for crimes under international law and gross human rights violations?.
 
 
The two NGOs propose initiatives through which States, civil society and other stakeholders can better engage the Geneva-based human rights bodies to better promote accountability.
 The launch of the publication is scheduled on Wednesday 11 September, 14.00, Palais des Nations, Room XI, at a side event to the 24th Session of the UN Human Rights Council.
