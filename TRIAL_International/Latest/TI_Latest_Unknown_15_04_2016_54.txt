facts

Víctor Manuel Lobos is a retired Argentine police officer. He was the deputy chief of the 13th station of Sierra Grande in the province of Río Grande.
During the Argentine dictatorship, he participated in the antisubversive strategy between 24 March 1976 and 10 December 1983 which involved a systematic plan of kidnappings and forced disappearances of people throughout the country by the military junta.
Within the framework of this strategy, Lobos, together with Sixto Navarrete Elfio Enrique Navarrete, Raúl Lucio Gerardo Pedernera, Néstor Rubén Castelli y Alberto Mario Marasco, all members of the Argentine police force or army, played a part in the kidnapping and torture of the trade unionists from the city of Sierra Grande, in the Río Grande province. The victims included; Daniel Orlando Ávalos, Secretary General of the Atlantic section of the working union of the construction of the republic of Argentina (UOCRA), and Carlos Apolinario Lima, member of the Sierra Grande section of the UOCRA. Both men were retained in the aforementioned city on 2 April 1976 and were transferred to Viedma in an army vehicle on 5 April. Once there, they were taken to a basement in the Río Grande police training school where they were tortured physically and abused by the firing squad. Ávalos was freed on 20 April 1976, and Lima was freed on 5 July of the same year.
On 29 July 2011, the Roca oral federal court found Lobos guilty of participating in the illegitimate imprisonment, aggravated by violence and serious harm to health, of the trade unionist Carlos Apolinario Lima. This act was seen by the court to be a crime against humanity, and Lobos was sentenced to 7 years and 10 months in prison and special disqualification for double the length of the prison sentence.
