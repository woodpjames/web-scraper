Enforced Disappearance of Roy Rivera in Mexico: Seven Years without Answers and Justice
15.01.2018
Irma Leticia Hidalgo Rea v. Mexico 
In the night between 10 and 11 January 2011, a group of heavily armed men broke into Ms. Hidalgo Reaâ€™s house, threatened and beat the members of the family and eventually took away her son Roy (then 18 years old). The fate and whereabouts of Roy remain unknown since then and no one has been judged and sanctioned for this crime. In January 2018, TRIAL and the Centro Diocesano para los derechos humanos Fray Juan de Larios submitted a complaint on behalf of Ms. Irma Leticia Hidalgo Rea before the United Nations Human Rights Committee, aiming at obtaining justice and redress.
