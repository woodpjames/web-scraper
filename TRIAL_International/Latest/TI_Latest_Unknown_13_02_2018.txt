Facts

Alexander Blackman, a British man from Somerset, England, was the commander of the 42 Commando, a patrol of the Royal Marines serving as part of the British Armed Forces. The 42 Commando was sent to Afghanistan for a six-month tour of duty to Helmand province. On 15 September 2011, two Taliban insurgents started firing at the 42 Commandoâ€™s patrol base. One of the attackers was seriously injured by gunfire from an Apache helicopter sent to provide air support, and the marines found him in a field.
A footage from an unofficial helmet-mounted camera of another marine shows Alexander Blackman shooting the wounded Taliban fighter in the chest at a close range with a pistol.
