Facts

Petre Roman was born in on 22 July 1946 in Bucharest, Romania. He is an electric engineer.
On 15 December 1989, a month after Ceausescu was re-elected as head of the Communist Party, anti-government riots broke out in Timisoara, West Romania, against the country’s Communist regime. The military was sent to control the riots, but failed to establish order. The riots quickly turned into bloody street battles between the angry mass and those loyal to the President.
Roman is accused to have participated in the crowd occupying the National Television building during at the time.
Ceausescu and his wife were tried and summarily executed on 25 December 1989. Following the news of the couple’s death, the street protests finally subsided. In all, over 1’100 people were killed, and over 3’350 were injured during the December protests in various Romanian cities.
On 26 December 1989, Roman became Romania’s first non-Communist Prime Minister since 1945. He remained officially in office until 1 October 1991, after which he remained active in politics.
Between 13 and 15 June 1990, peaceful anti-government protesters were confronted by over 10’000 pro-government miners, and the protests were then violently repressed by governmental forces, allegedly summoned by Roman, Iliescu, and several other officials. During the demonstrations, known as the ‘Mineriad’, four people were killed, 1’388 were injured and 1’250 people were arbitrarily arrested. Allegedly, the then-President Ion Iliescu called the minors of Valea Jiului, the country’s main coal basin, to go to Bucharest and pacify the “punks” and “thugs”.
