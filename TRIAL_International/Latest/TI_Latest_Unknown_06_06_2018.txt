Rafiq Shahadah - Marie Colvin case
06.06.2018
Facts

Rafiq Shahadah is a general of the Syrian armed forces, who served as adviser to President Bashar al-Assad on strategic issues and military intelligence. He was appointed head of military intelligence in July 2012. Since 2011 he has been targeted by European sanctions because of his supposed leadership of the military intelligence in charge of internal affairs in Damascus and his role in the repression of the civilian population.
On 22 February 2012, while war correspondent Marie Colvin was covering the siege of the city of Homs, she lost her life in an attack of the Syrian government forces against the building where she was with other journalists. Shahadah is accused of being one of the Syrian officials behind this attack.
