facts 

Milan Bojanic was a member of the Territorial Defense Forces of the Yugoslav Republics in the Vukovar region in Croatia. This military unit, together with the Yugoslav People’s Army, fought against the forces of the Republic of Croatia on behalf of the Serbian minority which was seeking to secede from the Republic of Croatia between August 1991 and May 1992.
Allegedly, Bojanic participated in killings, torture and robbery of non-Serbs living in the village Miklusevci which had fallen to Serb forces.
He has been accused of forcing 98 residents to leave the village robbing them of their money, jewellery and other valuables on 18 May 1992 by throwing bombs into the houses and threatening them with firearms. According to the allegations, four persons were killed and six persons were tortured. These acts were performed on behalf of the self-proclaimed government of the Serb Autonomous Region of Krajina with the object of expelling the non-Serb population from their own homes to prevent and destroy their further existence.
Milan Bojanic was charged with genocide together with 34 other people on 29 April 1996 under Article 119 of the Basic Criminal Law of the Republic of Croatia by the Osijek County State’s Attorney Office.
