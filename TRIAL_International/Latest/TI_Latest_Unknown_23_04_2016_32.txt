On 25 March 1999, Gavrilovic led an attack against the village of Trnje, which is situated in South Kosovo. As an officer of the Serbian Army he ordered a unit of the 549th regiment of the Yugoslavian Army to split into three groups and attack the village. According to the indictment, Gavrilovic gave the following order to his troops: “do not leave any survivors”. However, he denies having ordered this attack.
