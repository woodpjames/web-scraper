Bernard Hategekimana was the former owner and managing editor of the Rwandan newspaper Kamarampaka during the genocide in Rwanda. According to human rights activists, shortly before the mass killings began, he published several articles that “clearly incited Hutus to kill Tutsis”.
In July 1994, after the Hutu regime collapsed, Hategakimana went to Zaire (Democratic Republic of Congo) to seek refuge. In the late 1990s, he returned to Rwanda but did not continue working in the media.
