facts

Esef Huric was born on 24 September 1958 in Goražde, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where he is still a police officer.
Acting as de facto Commander of the Goražde Police Station between May 1992 and January 1993, Huric allegedly detained Serb civilians, including children, in the Goražde police station and other buildings in the town, often in inhumane and unhygienic conditions, which caused them great physical and mental harm.
In particular, from July to late October 1992 approximately 70 civilians were held in custody in four different apartments located near the police station. Other 35 civilians were illegally detained in police buildings in Goražde from July 1992 to February 1993.
It has also been alleged that some detainees lost their lives for denial of medical assistance in custody: two died in the police station, four deceased right after their release, while one tried to commit suicide and died in hospital after this attempt.
