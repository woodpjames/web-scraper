facts

Zoran Marinic, alias “Svabo”, was born on 6 June 1963 or close to that date in the Ravan sector of Busovaca in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
Zoran Marinic was a member of the HVO (Croatian Defence Council) military police force in Busovaca, a town for the most part made up of Croatians and Muslims.
The HVO, created in April 1992 was the supreme executive, administrative and military body of the HZ H-B/HR-B (Croatian Community of the Herceg-Bosna Croatian Republic of Herceg-Bosna), and defined itself as “a separate or distinct political, cultural, economic and territorial entity” within the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
In January 1993, units of the HVO began to persecute Muslims from the Busovaca region. On 16 April 1993, the conflict came to a head when HVO forces attacked Muslim towns and villages throughout the whole region of the Lasva river valley.
These systematic attacks against Bosnian Muslim civilians continued at least until the end of the month of May 1993.
Numerous Muslims from Busovaca and the surrounding regions were expelled by the HVO forces or left on their own accord.
However, several Muslim families stayed on in Busovaca.
On the evening of 26 April 1993, Zoran Marinic and several unidentified HVO soldiers broke into the houses of two Muslim families, killed or wounded the members of these families then burned down the houses.
