facts

Hermán Julio Brady Roche was the Minister of Defence of Chile under the dictatorship of the General Augusto Pinochet between 1975 to 1978 and, therefore, he was one of the leaders of the military junta governing Chile.
During the Coup d’Etat of 11 September 1973, he was the Commander in Chief of the Second Division of the army, chief of the garrison in Santiago. After the enforcement of the state of emergency in the region of Santiago, he was the highest military authority in Santiago after Pinochet himself.
After the arrest of Pinochet in London in 1998, Brady Roche was accused of being responsible for many forced disappearances which included those of the twelve people close to Salvador Allende present in the Moneda Palace and murdered near Tacna (the French-Chilean Georges Klein), that of the American Charles Horman, and that of the Hispano-Chilean diplomat Carmelo Soria.
Brady Roche was prosecuted in Chile, Spain and France for the forced disappearances that had taken place in the Moneda Palace, but only the procedure in France resulted in a sentence of 30 years imprisonment on 17 December 2010. However, he died on 16 May 2011 before his conviction could come into effect.
