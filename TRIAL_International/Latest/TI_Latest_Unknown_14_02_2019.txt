TRIAL International at the FIFDH
14.02.2019
The International Film Festival and Forum on Human Rights (FIFDH) will take place between 8 and 17 March 2019. Once again this year, TRIAL International is proud to be among its partners.
This year, TRIAL International sponsors the projection of Congo Lucha. This documentary shows the struggle of young activists in Eastern DRC, where TRIAL has been working since 2016.
Lucie Canal, Legal Advisor on sexual violence at TRIAL International, will also participate in the debate following the screening of On Her Shoulders. Shortlisted for the Festival’s competition, it follows the journey of Nadia Murad, from ISIS sexual slave to Nobel Peace Prize laureate.
The FIFDH is the most important event dedicated to cinema and human rights around the world. It takes place every year in parallel with the UN’s Human Rights Council in Geneva, which is also home to TRIAL International’s headquarters.
