Zoran Damjanovic was born on 4 September 1967 in Sarajevo, in Bosnia and Herzegovina. He is a citizen of Bosnia-Herzegovina of Serbian nationality.
On 2 June 1992, Zoran Damjanovic and his brother Goran Damjanovic, both members of the Bosnian Serb Army (Army of Republika Srpska â€“ VRS), allegedly tortured a group of about twenty to thirty male Bosniaks taken prisoners at a supermarket in the residential zone of Bojnik in Sarajevo. The victims had been captured earlier that same day by Serb military forces: some had been wounded, and others had surrendered. They were kicked and punched and beaten with firearms and clubs, in reprisal for having resisted the Serbian Army the attack on the residential zone of Ahatovici. The action was also allegedly motivated as a discriminatory retaliation against the victims because of their Bosniak nationality.
