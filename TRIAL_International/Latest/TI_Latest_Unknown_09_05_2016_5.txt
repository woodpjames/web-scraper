facts


Saleh Younous was born on 1st January 1949 in Faya-Largeau, Chad. He was the first director of the Direction de la documentation et de la sécurité (DDS), who carried out his functions from April 1983 to 30 May 1987.
Created by the Presidential decree n° 005/PF of 26 January 1983, the DDS was an intelligence central directly subordinated to the Presidency of the Republic. At that time, the President of the Republic was Hissène Habré, now prosecuted for war crimes, crimes against humanity and torture before the Extraordinary African Chambers within the Senegalese jurisdictions.
As the director of the DDS, Younous was supervising in N’Djaména the arrest and torture operations undertaken by the Brigade spéciale d’intervention rapide (BSIR), which carried out the interrogations. Furthermore, Younous was designated by several victims as a perpetrator of acts of torture.
In 1990, Habré was removed from power and ran away to Senegal. The same year, a decree in Chad created a National commission of inquiry, whose report was published in May 1992, after 17 months of work.
In 2000, a complaint was filed by victims before the Chadian tribunals. Chad did not follow it up, until things evolved in 2014, because of a parallel procedure in front of the Extraordinary African Chambers within the Senegalese jurisdictions.
