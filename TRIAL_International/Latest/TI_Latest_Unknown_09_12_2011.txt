facts

Samuel Ndashyikirwa was born in 1960.
At the time of the alleged incidents, he was a small business owner in the Kibungo prefecture in the south-east of Rwanda. Around 50,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed in this prefecture between 6 and 22 April 1994. Ndashyikirwa is the half-brother of Etienne Nzabonimana, also accused in the same affair.
According to the indictment, Samuel Ndashykirwa owned two drinks stores in Kirwa, a village located half an hour by dirt track from Kibungo where he also ran a small taxi-bus operation. The act of indictment refers to overwhelming evidence concerning his direct involvement in various murders committed in April 1994, especially in Kirwa, his birthplace, where he was a leading citizen.
Several witnesses pointed out that he was involved in the preparation of the genocide in Kirwa and that he provided support to the militias over which, according to the witnesses, he had a powerful influence. Many of these witnesses testified that they had seen him at the scene of the massacres at the very moment they were being carried out. He vehemently denied this but his explanations were discordant. After having at first held the same position as his half brother, he went on to explain that he had been present only to try to put a stop to the killings.
He was arrested on 4 December 2002 in Antwerp, where he had been living after acquiring refugee status under the assumed name of Samuel Manzi.
