From child soldier to human rights advocate
12.02.2018
Lenin Bista was recruited at the age of 11 by the Nepali Maoist guerilla. After suffering from war, violence and humiliation, he is now campaigning for his rights and those of his peers.
In August and November 2017, the Human Rights and Justice Centre (a partner organization of TRIAL International) organized, in Kathmandu, a training* for former Nepali child soldiers. Lenin Bista attended this training to gain knowledge on various documentation techniques and advocacy at the international level.
