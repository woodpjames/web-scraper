Radenko Alavanja was born in 1960 and was a Serbian wartime commander in the village of Borovo Selo in Croatia. Borovo Selo is a Serb-populated village in which one of the first armed confrontations of the Croatian War of Independence took place. The conflict was precipitated by months of rising ethnic tensions and armed combat.
Prosecutors accuse Alavanja of war crimes against civilians, taken from Vukovar to the nearby village of Borovo Selo, after Serbian forces seized the Croatian town in 1991. Civilians were brought into the local elementary school – called Bozidar Maslarić – and detained there. They were deprived of money and other valuables, injured and then killed. According to the indictment against Alavanja, fifteen civilians were killed and twenty-one more disappeared between 18 November and 22 November 1991. Thirty-one further civilians were tortured, two of whom were killed afterwards.
Alavanja was indicted in absentia for allegedly not preventing his subordinates from killing and torturing civilian prisoners taken from Vukovar to the nearby village of Borovo Selo, where he was the wartime commander.
