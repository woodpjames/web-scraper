facts 


Ao An, also called Ta An, was a deputy secretary in the Central Zone of DeÂ­mocratic Kampuchea in Cambodia during the Pol Pot dictatorship between 1975 and 1979.
An assisted Im Chaem, the District Chief of Preah Net Preah, while she was running the forced labour camp of Spean Sreng. Allegedly, An oversaw the death of thousands of civilians in this camp.
An is also suspected of having supervised the killings of many Cambodians, mainly Cham Muslims, on the Kok Pring execution site and in the security centres of Tuol Beng and Wat Au Trakuon.
On 7 September 2009, the international Co-Prosecutor of the ECCC requested that the Co-Investigating Judges initiate an investigation of five suspects, including An. The investigation of An is referred to as Case 004, and also included Chaem as well as Ta Tith, another former deputy in the Preah Net Preah District.
