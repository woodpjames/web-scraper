facts

Latif Gashi, also known as Commander “Lata”, was born on 12 September 1961 in the village of Doberdol, in Kosovo. During the 1998-1999 Kosovo war, he was commander of the military police unit of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA). He later became chief of the intelligence service within the Lab region.
It is alleged that between August 1998 and June 1999 Latif Gashi, together with the other two members of the so-called “Llapi group”, Rrustem Mustafa and Nazif Mehmeti, illegally imprisoned Kosovo Albanian citizens in the detention centre of Llapashtica. Gashi allegedly supervised the camp and ensured control over the prisoners, whilst knowing that they were held in inhumane conditions which lacked basic sanitation. The detainees under suspicion of collaboration with the Serb forces were reportedly subjected to beatings and torture, with the aim of forcing them to confess acts of disloyalty to the KLA. Some are said to have died in detention. Gashi himself, as head of the intelligence service, ordered and participated in the interrogations. The illegal detention also deprived prisoners of their right to a fair trial.
After the conflict, Gashi became a parliamentary deputy of the governing Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK).
