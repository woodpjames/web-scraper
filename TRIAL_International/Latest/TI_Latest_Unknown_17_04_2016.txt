facts

Milivoj Asner was born on 21 April 1913 in Daruvar, in the modern-day Republic of Croatia (“Croatia”). He studied in Zagreb to be a lawyer. In May 1941 he became chief of police of Pozega in the, at that time, Independent State of Croatia (“NDH”). Asner held this position until September 1942.
During this time, seizures of property, evictions and deportations to concentration camps, including Jasenovac, occurred affecting hundreds of Jews, Serbs and Roma of Pozega. Allegedly, it was Asner who signed these orders.
The Jewish population in Pozega was allegedly especially affected. On 18 October 1941 Asner allegedly signed an order evicting 63 Jewish families who were then exterminated. On 25 December 1941 around 150 Jews were brought in to the fireman’s hall in Pozega, where their valuables were confiscated and they were loaded into cattle wagons destined for the NDH’s concentration camps. It is alleged that no one survived this event. By 1942 there were no Jews left in Pozega.
At the end of World War II, the NDH collapsed and Asner fled to Austria. In 1946 he was granted Austrian citizenship under the name Georg Aschner. He returned to Croatia in 1992, after the fall of the Socialist Republic of Croatia and took citizenship in the Republic of Croatia. In doing so, Asner gave up his Austrian citizenship.
In 2004 Efraim Zuroff, head of the Simon Wiesenthal Centre, presented evidence collected against Asner to Stipe Mesic, President of Croatia. Asner was accused of having authorized and organised the deportation of Jews, Serbs and Roma from Pozega. In July 2004 Mesic ordered investigation into the case and that Asner should not be allowed to leave Croatia. Asner, who was allegedly warned about the orders, immediately left Croatia for Austria.
