Zoran Kupreskic was the local commander of the Croatian Defence Council (HVO) for the Ahmici region.
The HVO was the supreme executive, administrative and military body of the HZ H-B/HR-B (Croatian Community of the Herceg-Bosna/Croatian Republic of Herceg-Bosna), created in 1991. This community, considered itself as an independent political entity within the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
According to the indictment, modified on 9 February 1998, Zoran Kupreskic, between October 1992 and April 1993, was reported to have persecuted the Muslim inhabitants of Ahmici-Santici and its surroundings on political, racial or religious grounds by planning, organising and carrying out an attack aimed at evacuating or “cleansing” the village and the surrounding region of all of the Bosnian Muslims.
The same indictment alleged that he had helped in the preparations for the April attack, against the civilian population of Ahmici-Santici. The HVO was said to have firstly bombarded Ahmici-Santici from a distance, with groups of soldiers subsequently going from house to house and, using incendiary tracer bullets and explosives, aggressing Bosnian Muslim civilians and laying hold of their belongings.
At dawn on 16 April 1993, during this attack on Ahmici, Zoran Kupreskic was said to have broken into the house of a Muslim family accompanied by his brother Mirjan (see “related cases”) and together, to have killed four people and seriously injured a fifth after first setting the house on fire.
Zoran Kupreskic gave himself up voluntarily on 6 October 1997. He was transferred to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) at The Hague on the same day.
