facts

Almaz Nezirovic was born on 14 August 1959 in Derventa, Bosnia and Herzegovina. At the time of the alleged crimes, he was a prison guard at the Rabic prison camp in Derventa. In 1992 Serbian troops were reported to have attacked Deventa the town where he was born. Following this Nezirovic joined the Croatian Defense Council, a paramilitary group in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Between April and June 1992, Nezirovic was said to have tortured 22 Serbian civilians living in Bosnia. This, he was alleged to have done by beating the prisoners with rifle butts and sticks, by starving them, and by forcing them to crawl on hands and knees on the ground and eat grass soaked in urine.
Following these events, Nezirovic was said to have moved to Germany in 1994, and then subsequently to Austria. In 1997, he submitted an application for refugee status in the United States. His request was accepted on 2 May 1997.
In 2004, Nezirovic asked to be granted American citizenship. In 2006, he was interviewed in connection with this request for naturalization.
On 17 June 2011, Nezirovic was arrested in virtue of a federal indictment, issued on 9 June 2011 by the United States, which accused him of intentionally inflicting acute suffering and serious injury on Serbian prisoners during the war in the former Yugoslavia. This indictment was also therefore an allegation that he had lied in his naturalization request and had made false declarations during his interview.
