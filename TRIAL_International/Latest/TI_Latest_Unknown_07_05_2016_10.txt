facts

Sami Lushtaku served in the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) during the Kosovo War. After the war, Lushtaku became mayor of the town Skenderaj/Srbice in Kosovo. He held the position twice and was elected a third time, but could not accept it due to the uncertainty of his current legal status.
Lushtaku is purported to have been a member of the KLA wartime guerilla cell, the “Drenica Group”. Between June and September 1998, Lushtaku, in conjunction with group members Sylejman Selimi, Avni Zabeli, and Sahit Jashar, was allegedly in charge of a KLA detention centre in Likovac. These group members have been accused of mistreating the civilians held in the center, through torture and extrajudicial killings.
Lushtaku has specifically been accused of one instance of an unlawful killing of a civilian in addition to the torture and mistreatment of those detained in the centre. Witness reports suggest that Lushtaku believed that one of the prisoners had killed his cousin earlier in the conflict, and retaliated by shooting him in the head.
On 8 November 2013 the European Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo (EULEX) formally indicted Lushtaku, as well as 15 other alleged participants in the “Group of Drenica” for war crimes committed against the civilian population in the Likovac prison, while Lushtaku is additionally charged with the unlawful killing of civilians. Lushtaku, along with the other suspected members of the “Drenica Group”, was initially arrested on 31 May 2013 and transferred to a prison in Pristina, Kosovo.
