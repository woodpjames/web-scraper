facts


Pano Bulat is a Serbian citizen, was born on 30 January 1950. During the war in Croatia, Bulat held the position of Deputy Commander responsible for security within the second battalion of the Army of the Republic of Serb Krajina.
Between 19 and 23 March 1992 Bulat, is reported to have given the order to one of his subordinates, soldier Rade Vranesevic, to kill six Croatian nationals living in the village of Banatski Kovacevac, close to Karlovac in the east of Croatia. At the time the victims were aged between 63 and 81 years of age.
In order to carry out the deed the two soldiers led the civilians to believe that they were being deported to a more secure and safe part of the territory. However as soon as they had been assembled, they were gunned down by the two men who were armed with a rifle and a handgun.
The bodies of the victims were then said to have been thrown into a nearby pit which Bulat and Vranesevic then reportedly blew up.
At the end of the conflict in Croatia, The Tribunal of the County of Karlovac carried out an investigation against Bulat and Vranesevic. Due to the fact that both men were then residents of Serbia, the case was transferred to the Serbian Prosecutor in charge of war crimes under a Cooperation Agreement concluded between the prosecution authorities of Serbia and Croatia, and also under a Law of Legal Cooperation in criminal and civil matters adopted by both countries.
