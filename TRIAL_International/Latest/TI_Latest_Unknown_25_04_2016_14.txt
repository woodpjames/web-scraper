Eugene Nkuranyabahizi is a citizen of Burundy of Hutu ethnicity, and a former school teacher and Member of the Democratic Republic Movement (MDR-Power), an extremist political party during the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi period.
Nkuranyabahizi is suspected of taking part in several murders committed in the areas of Nkakwa, Kibangu, Cyahinda and Kanyaru river that were part of the former Nyakizu Commune in Southern Province of Rwanda (now in the Nyabihu and Nyanza Districts). He is further accused of having worked with the Interahamwe militia by murdering Tutsis who were attempting to cross the border into Burundi. Around 7500 individuals are believed to have perished in this region during the Genocide of April 1994.
Nkuranyabahizi avoided prosecution in Rwanda by escaping to Norway in 1999 where he learned Norwegian and gained a diploma, began a career in leadership development, community work and education and even met with the Crowned Prince of Norway, Prince HÃ¥kon.
Following the issuance of an indictment and arrest warrant by the Rwandan authorities, Nkuranyabahizi was arrested in Norway on 19 May 2013.
