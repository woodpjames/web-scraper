facts

Javier Figueroa is the former Deputy Chief of the Criminal Division of the Guatemalan National Civil Police (Policía Nacional Civil – PNC). He fled to Costa Rica on 4 March 2007. He then went to Austria and lived in Wernstein, near the town of Schaerding. He is married and has three children.
Javier Figueroa allegedly ordered, along with Erwin Sperisen the former Chief of the PNC, the execution of seven inmates in Pavon High Security Prison in the outskirts of Guatemala City. On 25 September 2006, an operation was conducted with the aim of retaking control over the prison, which had long been controlled by its inmates. More than 3000 agents of the PNC, the army and penitentiary authorities were mobilized. The crime scene was afterwards covered up to give the impression that the confrontations had led to their deaths.
On 12 December 2006, an agreement signed between the UN and the government of Guatemala established the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG). CICIG is an independent institution with the mandate to assist the office of the Guatemalan Prosecutor, the national police and other investigating institutions in the dismantlement of the crimes committed in Guatemala. CICIG is also empowered to conduct investigations proprio motu.
The investigations of the CICIG to the above-mentioned events resulted in the issuance of 18 arrest warrants, notably against Figueroa and Sperisen. Javier Figueroa was arrested in Austria in May 2011.
