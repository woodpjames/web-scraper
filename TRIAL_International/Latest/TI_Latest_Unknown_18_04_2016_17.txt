facts

Seljko Gojak, born in Croatia in 1962, was a member of the Croatian Police Special Forces during the war that took place in former Yugoslavia.
On 14 May 2013, the Croatian Supreme Court sentenced Seljko Gojak to nine years in prison for the double homicide of Dragica Ninkovic and her 14 year old niece on 5 October 1991 in Karlovac, a town in the centre of Croatia.
The two murders were committed at the teenager’s house, where the family had gathered for Sunday dinner. One group of the Croatian police’s Special Forces, of which Gojak was a member, entered the house and shot dead Marko Roknic and his daughter Danijela, as well as his sister Dragica Ninkovic. Marko Roknic was shot dead because he was Serbian. He was suspected of being part of a Serbian paramilitary group. Seljko Gojak was also part of the Karlovac police force, in charge of defending the town from Serbian paramilitary attacks.
As for Danijela’s mother, Branka Roknic, she was spared. A soldier that participated in the attack asked Gojak if he should shoot her too. Gojak responded, “No, leave her to suffer”. Branka then begged Gojak to call an ambulance for her daughter, who was still alive at the time, but the former police officer refused.
The case was suppressed and it was not until almost two decades later that the media turned their attention to this massacre and that an inquest was opened. As a matter of fact, Danijela’s mother and brother demanded the opening of the file at public prosecutor’s Special office for war crimes. As a result, in 2010 the Croatian authorities demanded the exhumation of the bodies, buried in a cemetery in Karlovac.
Gojak was put in provisional custody in May 2010.
