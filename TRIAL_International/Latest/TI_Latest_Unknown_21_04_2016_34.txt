Straton Musoni was born in 1961. He was residing in Germany since 1986. He was a computer specialist in the German state of Baden-Württemberg and worked, among other places, in the state ministry of justice.
Musoni has been Ignace Murwanashyaka‘s second-in-command as the head of the “Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda” (FDLR in French) since 2005. Previously called the “Army for the Liberation of Rwanda” (ALiR), the FDLR were created in 2001 and bring together the Rwandan Hutu – a group of around 5000 people who live in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the region that borders Rwanda. The FDLR are considered to be the principal cause of insecurity in Africa’s Great Lakes region.
Musoni is accused of coordinating – with Murwanashyaka – violent acts that were committed by the FDLR between January 2008 and July 2009. In particular, Musoni and Murwanshyaka are allegedly responsible of the attacks in Kipopo, Mianga, Busurungi, Kubua and Manje. The FDLR reportedly killed hundreds of civilians, pillaged and burned down a number of villages, and left many women raped or subjected to other forms of sexual violence. Numerous child soldiers have allegedly been recruited by force in order to carry out such operations.
In 2005, the United Nations Security Council issued sanctions against the Rwandan Hutu rebels and Congolese militia. For Musoni, these included travel bans and the freezing of his foreign assets from 2007 onwards.
Musoni was arrested in in 2006 in Germany for immigration violations and released shortly after.
