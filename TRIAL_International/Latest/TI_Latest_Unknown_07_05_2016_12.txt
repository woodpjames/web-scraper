facts

Vincas Valkavickas was born in 1920 in Lithuania. He studied until the fourth grade and he became a farmer.
During the Nazi invasion of Lithuania in 1941, he was a voluntary member of the Auxiliary Police of Lithuania supporting the Nazi control, an organization supposedly formed by the Provisional Government of Lithuania which aimed at collaborating with the Nazi activities.
On 27 September 1941, the Auxiliary Police of Lithuania supporting the Nazi control detained and imprisoned Jews in an old military facility close to Svencionys in Lithuania, known as the “Polygon”, where the victims were watched over by members of this same police.
According to the “List of police officers and soldiers who asked for a reward for the services they offered to the Jewish Action of Svencionys (Judenaktion)”, presented to the Head of the Lithuanian Administration of the Rural District of Vilnius on 12 December 1941, Valkanickas apparently received 19.17 state marks, official currency of Germany used from 1924 until 1948, for watching over 4’000 Jews crammed in hovels on the side of the city for 12 days, from 27 September until 9 October 1941, and for escorting the victims from the hovels to pits where they were assassinated on 7 and 8 October 1941, when the “Ypatingas Burys’, a special unit of the police of approximately 50 men, also called “the Lithuanian equivalent of Sondercommando”, arrived in Svencionys in order to kill the Jews.
Valkanickas arrived in the United States in 1950 and started working in a factory in Chicago until he retired and in 1998 the Special Investigations Officer of the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice of the United States, after an anonymous complaint to the police, started deportation proceedings before the Immigration Court of Chicago.
