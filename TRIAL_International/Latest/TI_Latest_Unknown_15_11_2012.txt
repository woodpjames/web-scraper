Goran Markovic was born in Sarajevo on 8 November 1964. He was the Commanding Officer of the 2nd Platoon of the 1st Company of the Training Center Jahorina.
When commanding his unit, acting individually and in concert with other participants, Goran Markovic planned, ordered, incited and took part in the realization of the systemic and joint criminal enterprise alongside Duško Jević and Mendeljev Đurić.
Between the 10th and 19th of July 1995, the accused, as co-perpetrator, allegedly inflicted severe bodily and mental injuries on a group of Bosnians. The authors would have killed some male members of the group and forcefully transferred women, children and elderly persons out of the UN protected zone of Srebrenica to exterminate the remaining Bosnians.
The State Investigation and Protection Agency, SIPA, arrested Marković in December 2009. He has been held in custody since then.
