facts

Dragan Papic was born in the village of Santici on 15 July 1967. Before the war he was a forest ranger and lived with his family in Ahmici in the Vitez municipality.
Dragan Papic was a member of the HVO.
The HVO was the executive, administrative and supreme military organ of the HZ H-B/HR H-B (Croatian Community of the Herceg-Bosna/Croatian Republic of Herceg-Bosna), created in November 1991. This self proclaimed Republic defined itself as a separate or distinct entity within the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
According to the indictment, between October 1992 and April 1993, Dragan Papic was reported to have persecuted the Muslim inhabitants of Ahmici-Santici and its surroundings on political, racial or religious grounds by planning, organising and carrying out an attack aimed at evacuating or “cleansing” the village and the surrounding region of all of the Bosnian Muslims.
The same indictment alleged that he had helped in the preparations for the April attack, against the civilian population of Ahmici-Santici. The HVO was said to have firstly bombarded Ahmici-Santici from a distance, with groups of soldiers subsequently going from house to house and, using incendiary tracer bullets and explosives, aggressing Bosnian Muslim civilians and taking possession of their belongings.
More precisely, Dragan Papic was reported to have helped in and advocated the deliberate and systematic murder of Bosnian Muslim civilians, the wholesale destruction of houses and possessions belonging to Bosnian Muslims as well as the arrest and organised expulsions of Bosnian Muslims from Ahmici-Santici and surroundings.
Dragan Papic gave himself up voluntarily on 6 October 1997. He was transferred to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in The Hague on the same day.
