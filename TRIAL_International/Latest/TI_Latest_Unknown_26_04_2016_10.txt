facts

Zeleke Zerihun is a former colonel and police officer of the Ethiopian military junta. The junta, which is also known as the Dergue or Derg and the Coordinating Committee of the Armed Forces, Police and Territorial Army, was led by Colonel Mengistu Hailé Mariam, who overthrew Emperor Hailé Sélassié’s government in a bloody coup d’état in 1974. Mengistu Hailé Marian repressively governed Ethiopia under an intolerant regime that was without dissidence and opposition until 1991.
Zeleke Zerihun ran a police station in the Ethiopian capital during Mengistu Hailé Mariam’s regime. Zeleke Zerihun was accused of having directly participated in a number of acts of violence committed by the Derg during the “Red Terror” campaign.
He was accused of arresting five individuals for having distributed so-called anti-revolutionary propaganda. Subsequently, under his orders, these five individuals would have been executed.
The Office of the Special Prosecutor was founded in Addis Ababa in 1992 with the aim of establishing a record of the abuse committed by Mengistu Hailé Mariam’s government and of initiating the legal proceedings against those judged to be responsible for human rights violations. The Federal High Court of Addis Ababa reviewed the files of almost 2500 respondents accused of genocide, war crimes and aggravated murder. The trials began in 1994 and were the object of recurrent adjournments. Some expert reports suggest that the Court should have assigned solicitors with little experience to the respondents who did not have their own means to arrange the services of a solicitor.
Zeleke Zerihun was charged by the High Court of Addis Ababa with genocide, crimes against humanity and a number of other crimes.
