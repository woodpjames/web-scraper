There is no personal information on Zoran Obradovic available, apart from the fact that he fled Serbia around 2001 to Germany.
Obradovic belonged to the paramilitary group “Cakali” (Jackals), nine of whose members went on trial in Belgrade for crimes committed against ethnic Albanian civilians during the 1999 Kosovo conflict. They are accused of having killed at least 43 civilians in the village of Cuška, near the western Kosovo town of Pec. At the time the village had mostly Albanian population.
According to the indictment of the Belgrade’s Higher Court War Crimes Department on 20 December 2010, nine members of the Cakali paramilitary group, among them Obradovic were charged for having committed 44 murders, rape, destruction and burning of 40 houses and robbery in an “extremely brutal” way, with “the main goal to spread fear among Albanian civilians in order to force them to leave their homes and flee to Albania.”
Zoran Obradovic was arrested in Germany in April 2010 and is still held in detention awaiting the ruling on the extradition request put forward by Serbia.
