facts 


Wayne Crowcroft was born in 1984. He was Lance Corporal in the 1st Battalion of the Queen’s Lancashire Regiment during the war against Iraq led by the United States and Britain.
In March 2003, after months of debate, the United States and Britain initiated the war on Iraq without the support of the U.N. Security Council. After four weeks, coalition ground and air forces surrounded and captured Baghdad and the Pentagon declared that major combat in Iraq was over.
Following a planned operation in the city of Basra, in the south of Iraq, Crowcroft, together with Donald Payne and Darren Fallen (see “related cases”), were suspected of having mistreated and tormented a group of Iraqi detainees between September 13 and 15, 2003. Crowcroft was also said to have been responsible for multiple grave assaults against them.
The British Attorney General Lord Goldsmith announced on 19 July 2005, that Lance Corporal Wane Crowcroft would be tried under the International Criminal Court Act 2001 on war crimes charges. Although charged under the above mentioned Act, the serviceman was to face court martial in Britain rather than being tried at The Hague.
