facts

Robert Ley was born into a farming family on 15 February 1890 in Niederbreidenbach. He took part in the First World War as an air force pilot. After his plane was shot down over France in 1917, Ley spent more than two years there as a prisoner of war.
After the war, Ley worked as a chemist, but was dismissed because of his problem with alcohol abuse. He joined the Nazi Party (NSDAP) in 1923 and two years later was appointed to the position of Gauleiter for South Rheinland.
By 1932 Robert Ley had become a member of parliament in the Reich and had taken over from Gregor Strasser as leader of the Reich’s organisational body for the NSDAP, a very important position in the party’s hierarchy.
After Hitler’s order to arrest the heads of the German workers unions in 1933, Ley was given the job of setting up and overseeing the German Labour Front to replace the hitherto banned workers unions.
Robert Ley was accused of having taken advantage of his various functions, his personal influence and his close contacts with Hitler to promote the accession to power of the Nazi conspirators and the control over Germany as set forth in count 1 of the indictment, and for contributing to the preparations for war. In addition, Ley authorized, directed and participated in the War Crimes set forth in count 3 of the indictment, and in the Crimes against Humanity set forth in count 4 of the indictment, particularly in relation to the abuse of human beings as labour in the conduct of the wars of aggression. During the war it was indeed Ley who supervised the mobilisation of both foreign and German workers to help with the war effort.
Upon his capture on 16 May 1945, Robert Ley was transferred to the Nuremberg International Military Tribunal.
