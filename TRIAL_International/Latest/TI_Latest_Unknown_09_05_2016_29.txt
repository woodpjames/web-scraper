Ante Kovac was born in 1957. Popular with residents in the Vitez municipality of Bosnia and Herzegovina, he rose to the role of commander of the Viteska Brigada, a brigade military squad within the Croatian Defence Council (HVO).
It is alleged that during the months of April 1993 and August 1993, during the Bosnian civil war, Kovac as commander of the brigade issued, allowed and participated in the commission of war crimes against more than 250 Bosniak civilians in the Bosnian town of Vitez.
The war crimes included illegal arrest and capture and detention, forced manual labour, torture and inhumane treatment, and two counts of rape.
It is alleged that the Bosniak civilians were imprisoned on the premises of the Radnicki University (also known as the Workersâ€™ University), the cinema and the building of the Public Auditing Service in Vitez. The forced labour consisted of the prisoners building trenches on the frontline where they were exposed to mortal danger. It is further alleged that some prisoners died after being caught in cross-fire. Additionally, it is alleged that prisoners were taken for interrogation where they were physically abused by military police officers.
Furthermore, it is alleged that Kovac raped two women during the same period, one of whom was a minor at the time.
In January 2008, Kovac was arrested by the Bosnian State Investigation and Protection Agency (SIPA) and the trial commenced on 13 August 2008.
