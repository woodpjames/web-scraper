ICC and universal jurisdiction: two ways, one fight

An op-ed by Valérie Paulet 
For the last 6 years, the international community has failed to end the massacre of civilian in Syria. Effective prosecution has been repeatedly impeded at the international level. Will these crimes therefore stay unpunished? Not necessarily, as some States are tackling impunity at national level through universal jurisdiction. 
Some crimes, such as bombing civilians, using chemical weapons or inflicting torture, are too heinous to be left unpunished. They shock the conscience and threaten the international peace and security. The perpetrators must be brought to justice.
Yet the ICC has a specific mandate, focused on the prosecution of those bearing the greatest responsibility in States that have ratified, or accepted, the Rome Statute.
Within that group, the ICC only has jurisdiction if States are unwilling or unable to prosecute alleged perpetrators. The level of “unwillingness” is difficult to assess: In Colombia for instance, the ICC has never asserted its jurisdiction arguing that some culprits – low-rank FARC and paramilitaries – had been judged before national courts.
These restrictions leave thousands of victims outside of the ICC’s scope – including Syrian victims, for instance, since the country has not ratified the Rome Statute. But restrictions also leave an avenue for States to step in.
