Facts

Xhemshit Krasniqi was born on 12 December 1963 in Prizren, Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia – currently Kosovo. Krasniqi was a member of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA).
From March to June 1999, the KLA, then fighting the Serbian police and military, had a base in the Albanian town of Kukes, from where they launched guerrilla operations across the border in southern Kosovo particularly in the surroundings of Prizren.  The KLA also maintained a network of prisons in their bases in northern Albania and Kosovo during and after the conflict of 1999 including the Cahan detention centre.
During this time, several detainees were thrown into makeshift cellblocks, left in insanitary conditions without food and water, and were visited periodically by KLA soldiers to be questioned under harsh treatment, or indiscriminately beaten. More than ten individuals – almost all of them ethnic Albanians – described having been detained indefinitely, struck with sticks and other objects, and subjected to several forms of ill-treatment at the Kukes and Cahan sites.
In June, two individuals were detained by KLA soldiers in a garage in Prizren, Nothern Kosovo, and subjected to several forms of ill-treatment and threats.
In this period, Krasniqi operated in the Kukes and Cahan detention centres and conducted military operations in southern Kosovo.
