facts

Maximilian Roithmeier was born in 1922. On 31 January 1941 he joined the German Schutzstaffel (SS). Towards the end of the war he had risen to the rank of SS-Oberscharführer in the 16th SS Armored Infantry Division.
His division had been commissioned to northern Italy after the country had surrendered to the Allied Forces. Between 29 September and 1 October 1944, about 800 Italian civilians were brutally killed by the members of Roithmeier’s division in the village of Marzabotto and the adjoining area in northern Italy. Most of the victims were women, children and elderly men.
The massacre committed against the civilian population was declared to be a retaliatory act for the resistance of the Italian partisans that operated in the occupied areas.
After WW II had finished, Max Roithmeier was captured on 17 May 1945 and held as a prisoner of war.
