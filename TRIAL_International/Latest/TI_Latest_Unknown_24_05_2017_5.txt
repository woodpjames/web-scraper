Amir Coralic, also known as “Pango”, was a member of the Fourth Brigade with the “National Defense”, the pro-independence Bosniak army of Bihac Province in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
On 13 December 1993, Coralic, together with two other militiamen, Redzep Beganovic and Hazim Keranovic, allegedly mistreated a civilian because his son was a member of the Fifth Corps with the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Some days later, they reportedly abducted two girls from their house in the municipality of Cazin and drove them to the village of Trzac. One of the victims was allegedly raped by Coralic and the other sexually assaulted.
At the end of the conflict, Coralic disappeared without traces.
