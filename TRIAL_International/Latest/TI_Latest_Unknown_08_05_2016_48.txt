facts


Bora Kuburic, a Serbian, was a soldier in Bosnia and Herzegovina during the war that took place in the Balkans in the 1990s.
While she was a soldier in the Serbian armed forces, Kuburic tortured a Bosnian nurse. She caused psychological and physical suffering before handing the nurse over to an ally, the Bosnian Serb Women’s Front military unit. As a result, the nurse found herself in the hands of her enemies.
During the summer of 1992, the nurse was forced to dig her own grave, undress, and crawl on the ground; as a result, she was left with cuts all over her body. Soldiers sexually assaulted the nurse.
Kuburic hit the nurse with wooden sticks, cut her hair and drew crosses into her skull and back with a knife, which caused extensive bleeding. She also cut off the nurse’s ear.
Kuburic has been indicted of the aforementioned crimes and legal proceedings against her began in 2013.
