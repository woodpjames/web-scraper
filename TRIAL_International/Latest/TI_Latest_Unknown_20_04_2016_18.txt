Julio Poch was born on 20 February 1952 in a family with three generations in the Navy. In 1968 he joins the Naval Academy. He belonged to the 101 promotion of the Naval Command. In 1974, he passes the course of naval aviators with the highest grade in his group. When the coup takes place in 1972, he has the rank of Lieutenant Commander and is assigned to the Naval Air Assault Academy. In 1977 he joined the Third Naval Air Squadron. In the next two years, most part of the so-called “death flights” took place.
In February 1981, Poch retired from the Argentinean Navy with the rank of Frigate Lieutenant. In late May 1982, he was convened by the Navy to participate in the Falklands War. In 1988 ye moved to the Netherlands with his wife and three children. He works as a pilot of the Transavia company, which is a subsidiary of Air France-KLM. He obtained the Netherlands nationality without losing the Argentinean.
In 2007, during a dinner with colleagues in Bali, Indonesia, he declares that “during his service for Videla’s government, he regularly made flights during which people alive, but drugged, were thrown to the sea” because they had to “get rid of the terrorists”. Outraged, his colleagues reported Poch to the Dutch authorities.
The Dutch authorities opened a case against Poch in 2007 and a judge travelled to Argentina to interview Judge Sergio Torres who is in charge of the ESMA trials, who in turn travels to the Netherlands to hear the testimonies of the pilots.
