facts

Karl Doenitz was born in Berlin-Grenau on 16 September 1891
In 1935, Doenitz was given command of the fleet of German submarines. He became vice-admiral in 1940 and finally admiral in 1942. When he became Commander in Chief of the German naval fleet on January 30 1943, he authorized German submarines to sink all commercial vessels, be they hostile or neutral. Moreover, in 1944, he ordered 12’000 prisoners held in concentration camps to be employed in naval construction yards, despite the fact that he was not directly responsible for these shipyards.
On September 17 1942, Doenitz issued the “Laconia Order” to the submarine fleet, an order that forbade German ships to come to the aide of any surviving members of sunken enemy vessels. Doenitz took advantage of this pronouncement to point out that Germany’s enemies had not been preoccupied by the fate of women and children when they bombed the German cities.
From 1943, Hitler regularly consulted him in matters of naval strategy. In his last will, Hitler declared Doenitz his successor at the head of the German state.
Doenitz was arrested by British troops on May 23 1945.
