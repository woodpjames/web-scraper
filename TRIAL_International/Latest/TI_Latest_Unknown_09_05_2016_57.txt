facts


Agustin Echeverria was born in 1950. In 1974 he joined the ranks of the police in the province of Formosa, located in the north east of Argentina. He was at that time member of the Formosa Infantry Regiment of Monte 29 (RIM 29). Although he left the police force in 1975, he rejoined RIM 29 in February 1976, a few days before the coup d’état which overthrew the government of Isabel Peron, replacing it with a military dictatorship which was to last for seven years. Echeverria then began working in the regime’s secret detention centers where he interrogated political prisoners and reportedly subjected them to torture.
Following this he was selected to follow a police sponsored training course on the fight against urban guerrillas, which he readily accepted hoping that it would serve to advance his career. At the end of the dictatorship, he was quickly promoted to the position of Deputy Police Superintendent in the Formosa Police a position he held during the 1990’s.
He finally retired with the grade of General Police Superintendent, but continued to act as consultant to Governor Gildo Insfran whilst running for office as deputy in the Formosa province.
On 25 February 2009, in the town of Formosa, there began a string of trials for crimes against humanity committed during the time of the government of Juan Carlos Colombo who was governor of the province from 1976 to 1981. The name of Echeverria came up several times in the Colombo hearing but also that of Sergeant Juan Carlos Camicha.
Echeverria was arrested in August 2013 and the Federal Criminal Appeal Court refused to accord him conditional release on the grounds that he was a flight risk. At the time he stood accused of conspiracy, unlawful deprivation of liberty and torture against three victims.
