TRIAL acts before the Committee on Enforced Disappearances
01.12.2014
In December 2014, TRIAL and a coalition of eight civil society associations from Mexico, Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador submitted an alternative report to the UN Committee on Enforced Disappearances (CED) in view of the forthcoming exam of Mexicoâ€™s official report, which will take place in February 2015 in Geneva. The alternative report provides answers to the questions previously formulated by the CED in its list of issues and focuses mainly on the subject of enforced disappearance of migrants in Mexico and highlights the existence of several pitfalls in the existing legislation, which does not respect the obligations established by the International Convention on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance.
