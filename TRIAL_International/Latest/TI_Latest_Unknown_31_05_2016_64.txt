facts

François Karera was born in 1939 in Musasa, Rwanda. At the time of the facts described here he was Governor of the Prefecture of Kigali-Rural (central Rwanda) and member of the MRND (Mouvement Républicain National pour le Développement et la Démocratie; National Republican Movement for Development and Democracy). In carrying out this function, he exercised authority over all the mayors of the region, all the administrative personnel and all agents responsible for the application of the law.
In April and May 1994, François Karera was said to have organised and supervised an extermination campaign directed against Tutsi civilians in Nyamirambo, the city of Kigali and in Kanzenze. In particular, he allegedly assisted police officers and gendarmes in killing a great number of Tutsi civilians who had sought refuge in the church of Ntarama in Kazenze. Faced with the advance of the Front Patriotique Rwandais (Rwandan Patriotic Front) , he fled Rwanda. However, even after his escape, he still was said to have continued planning massacres directed against the Tutsi from a refugee camp in Zaire.
François Karera was arrested in Kenya on 20 October 2001 and transferred to the UN penitentiary quarters of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) in Arusha, Tanzania, the following day.
