Facts

Borislav Paravac was born on 18 February 1943 in Kostajnica, near Doboj in northern Bosnia. He graduated from the faculty of Economy at the University of Zagreb in 1966. From 1990 to 2000, he was mayor of Doboj municipality, and was also a Parliament Member in the Republika Srpska People’s Assembly. From 2003 to 2006 he was the Serb member of the tripartite presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina, following up Mirko Sarovic. After this mandate, he retired and lived in Doboj.
From May 1992 until the end of 1993, Paravac was allegedly involved in attacks on the civilian population in Doboj carried out by the military, police and paramilitary units under the control structure of the former Serbian Autonomous Region of Northern Bosnia (SAOSB). Paravac was reportedly responsible for these attacks in his function of president of the crisis committee in the Doboj municipality, established by the Serb Democratic Party (SDS). He allegedly participated in these attacks together with Milan Ninkovic, a member of the crisis committee, Andrija Bjelosevic, the chief of the public security centre in Doboj and Milan Savic, his deputy.
During those attacks, hundreds of victims were said to have been killed and thousands of civilians were said to have been unlawfully detained in detention camps, where they were tortured, abused and beaten.
Furthermore, those attacks reportedly also led to the destruction of a large number of religious and cultural buildings in Doboj, and Teslic, which served the religious needs of the Bosniak and Croatian population and were protected cultural monuments. 
According to the indictment, almost the entire population of Bosniak and Croatian nationality, which consisted of tens of thousands of citizens, disappeared from Doboj and Teslic.
Paravac, Ninkovic, Bjelosevic and Savic were formally indicted on 31 December 2015.
