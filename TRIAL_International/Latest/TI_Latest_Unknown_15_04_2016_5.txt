facts

Roberto Heriberto Albornoz was born on 20 November 1931 in the city of San Miguel de Tucumán. Albornoz is a former member of the Argentine police and is commonly known by the name “El Tuerto” (“the one-eyed man” in English). From the 1970s until the end of the dictatorship in Argentina, Albornoz was attached to the Tucumán police headquarters in the north of the country. From there, he carried out a severe repression against Tucuman’s working class activists, its students and its workers.
In 1973, Albornoz was retired from the police service but he was reintegrated in the early months of 1974. Following instructions from Luciano Benjamín Menéndez – then commander of the Fifth Brigade – Albornoz created a detention, torture, death and disappearance squad along with servicemen from the 142 Intelligence Detachment. For this work, Albornoz set-up a suitable concentration camp in the southern wing of the police headquarters.
During Jorge Rafael Videla’s dictatorship, Albornoz was named Head of Intelligence of the Tucumán police force and continued his work with Luciano Benjamín Menéndez who was, at this time, head of the third army corps.
Albornoz is accused, along with other police officers and servicemen who formed part of the Tucumán security corps, of various breaches of human rights. These violations include the detention, enforced disappareances and murders of Juan Carlos Aguirre and Margarita Azize Weiss in July 1976. This couple were renowned left-wing activists.
On 9 July 2010 Tucumán’s Federal Oral Court sentenced Roberto Albornoz, along with Luciano Benjamín Menéndez, to life imprisonment for crimes against humanity relating to the deaths of 22 people at the hands of the Tucumán police.
