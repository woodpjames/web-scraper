Arnold Meri was born in Estonia in 1919 and enlisted with the Red Army in 1940, earning a Gold Star for his part in the defence of Estonia from the German Army at Dno in July 1941. Meri was the first Estonian to receive such an award.
During the Second World War, Meri served as the Secretary of the Central Committee of Komsomol in Estonia and was awarded the Order of Lenin in 1948. Meri held several high profile posts in Soviet Estonia, including acting as Chief Adviser to the Minister of Education.
Meri allegedly took part in the deportation of 251 Estonian nationals, mainly women and children, to Siberia in 1949, 43 of whom died. According to the Prosecutorâ€™s Office, most of the deportees were women and children.
Since Estonia became independent in 1991 there has been a series of attempts by the Estonian Security Police to hold accountable those who took part in the deportation of over 20,000 Estonian nationals to Siberia in the aftermath of World War II. In 2003, the Security Police launched an investigation against Meri.
