BiH: second Vogosca family defended by TRIAL
26.08.2009
n August 2009, the Advocacy Center – TRIAL (ACT) submitted a communication to the UN Human Rights Committee concerning the enforced disappearance of Huso Zlatarac and Nedžad Zlatarac. ACT represents Hasiba Zlatarac and Alma Cardakovic, wife and daughter respectively of Huso Zlatarac and mother and sister respectively of Nedžad Zlatarac.
 On 4 May 1992, Huso Zlatarac was arrested in Svrake (BiH) by the Serb army together with Hasiba Zlatarac and their children Nedžad (then 21 years old) and Alma (14) and most of the inhabitants of the same village. They were all taken to the concentration camp known as Kasarna JNA in Semizovac.
A few days later, Hasiba Zlatarac, together with her daughter Alma and other women and children, were freed. Huso Zlatarac and his son Nedžad were kept prisoners and transferred to different concentration camps, where they were subjected to torture and forced labour. Huso and Nedžad Zlatarac were last seen on 16 June 1992 in the concentration camp known as “Planjina kuca”, located in the municipality of Vogosca. Their fate and whereabouts remain unknown since then.
More than 17 years after the events, no ex officio, prompt, impartial, thorough and independent investigation has been undertaken by BiH authorities in order to locate Huso and Nedžad Zlatarac or their remains or to identify, prosecute and sanction those responsible. Mrs. Zlatarac has taken several steps to obtain information about her husband and son, through the police of Visoko and Vogosca, the State Commission for Tracing Missing Persons, the Sarajevo Cantonal Prosecutor’s Office, and the Red Cross Society of BiH. These initiatives have to date proved vain.
