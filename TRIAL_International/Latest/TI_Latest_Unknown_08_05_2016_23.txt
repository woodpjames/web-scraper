Radomir Radovan Susnjar, known as Lalco, was born in 1955 in Bosnia Herzegovina. He worked as a delivery driver for a bakery in the city of Višegrad before the war started.
Susnjar is suspected of participating in what has been called the “live bonfire” (“Živa lomača”) the burning alive of 59 Bosniaks civilians, one of the massacre for which Milan Lukic, former leader of a Serb paramilitary group, the white eagle (Beli Orlovi), has been already tried and sentenced by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY).
On 14 June 1992, more than 60 persons, mostly women, elderly people and children, among which a two days old baby, were arrested and detained in a house on Pionirska Street in Višegrad. After being locked into one room, the building was set on fire and those who attempted to flee through the windows were shot. Only seven survived. Susnjar is suspected of personally locked up the victims in the house and set it on fire.
Susnjar is also suspected of being involved in the kidnapping of train passengers at Štrpci. On 27 February 1993, a train from Belgrade to Bar in Montenegro was stopped by Bosnian Serbs militaries and 18 Serb nationals, of which 17 were Muslims and one was Croat, were allegedly taken to Višegrad to be executed.
