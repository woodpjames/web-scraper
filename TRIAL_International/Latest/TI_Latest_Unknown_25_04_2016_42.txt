facts

Mir Quasem Ali was born on 31 December 1952 in Munshidangi Sutalori in the district of Manikganj (in the center of today’s Bangladesh).
During the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971, he was known to be one of the leaders of Islami Chhatra Sangha (ICS), the student branch of the Jamaat-e-Islami party, before becoming General Secretary of the ICS for East Pakistan and Commander of the pro-Pakistani militia, Al-Badar, in the district of Chittagong in the south of today’s Bangladesh. Subsequently, he became an important figure within Al-Badar on a nationwide level alongside both Moulana Motiur Rahman Nizami and Ali Ahsan Mohammed Mujahid.
During the events in 1971, Quasem Ali was reported to be implicated in abduction, confinement, torture and murder of hundreds of Hindus and “freedom fighters”. Notably, he was said to have transformed the Dalim hotel, in the town of Chittagong, into a torture centre for Al-Badar. Many civilians were allegedly abducted from their homes and tortured in this detention centre during the month of November 1971. A number of those civilians were also killed there.
After independence, Quasem Ali fled the country to Saudi Arabia and returned to Bangladesh only after the murder of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibar Rahman, (one of the founding fathers of Bangladesh) on 15 August 1975.
On 6 February 1977 he became the first President of Islami Chhatra Shibir (formerly known as Islami Chhatra Sangha), the student wing of the Islamist political organization of Bangladesh, and then exercised various commercial functions, such as Director of Islami Bank.
On 17 June 2012, the Bangladesh International Crimes Tribunal issued an arrest warrant against Quasem Ali who was arrested the same day.
