Franc Kos was born on 16 July 1966 in Celje, Slovenia. He is a former commander of the 1st Bijeljina Platoon of the 10th Sabotage Detachment commando of the Republika Srpska Army. The commando was established in October 1994 to penetrate deep into Bosnian territory and to lay explosive charges under tanks or other military material during the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The unit participated in Srebrenica genocide in 1995.
After the war, Kos lived freely in a Serb-held town of Bijeljina with a fake ID issued by local Serb authorities, under the name “Branimir Miric”.
Kos and three other former members of the 10th commando allegedly participated in the systematic killing of at least 800 unarmed Bosniak men and boys following the fall of the Srebrenica protected zone in July 1995. Bosnian Muslim civilians were captured and then brought to a farm Branjevo near Zvornik, where they were systematically executed. It is alleged that the defendants, together with other members of the 10th Sabotage Detachment, executed prisoners who were blindfolded and had their hands tied. Additionally, Kos searched for survivors with signs of life and then shot them in the head.
An Interpol Red Notice was filed against Kos for his role in the Srebrenica genocide and execution of Bosnian Muslim captives. In April 2010 Kos was arrested by Croatian authorities at the border crossing with neighbouring Serbia near Osijek. He was extradited to Bosnia and Herzegovina in June 2010. An indictement was issued in August 2010 against Kos and three other former members of the 10th commando.
