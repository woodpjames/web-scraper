Đuro Jovan Krošnjar was born on 5 May 1958 in Berak, Croatia. Krošnjar is a Croatian Serb.
Krošnjar was a member of a Croatian Serb paramilitary group called Štaba teritorijalne obrane Mikluševci, meaning Mikluševci defence forces. The paramilitary group was associated with the Yugoslav People’s Army during the occupation of Mikluševci in Croatia from 8 October 1991 to 18 May 1992 during the Croatian War of Independence. The paramilitary group was allegedly led by Jugoslav Mišljenović.
During the occupation of the village of Mikluševci, which was inhabited by Croats, Serbs and mostly Ruthenian, the members of the Mikluševci defence forces harassed, intimidated, robbed and persecuted non-Serbs (Croats and the local Ruthenian minority).
On 18 May 1992, armed members of the paramilitary group forced written statements upon 98 villagers standing before the school building in Mikluševci, to declare that they would leave the village, leaving behind all property, personal belongings and valuables as well as money to the authorities of the Serbian Autonomous District Krajina (“SAO Krajina”). Krošnjar allegedly aided and abetted to the crime by escorting in arms the buses transporting the locals into exile. Krošnjar also particiapated in looting, and abusing the locals.
The Vukovar Police Administration initiated criminal investigations on 19 January 1993.
