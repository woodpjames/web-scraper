facts

Nenad Malic was born on 25 June 1961 in Becej, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). He is a cook by profession, is married and has two children. At the moment when the events took place, he was a member of the Sixth Brigade of the Republika Srpska (VRS) Army.
He was sentenced by the Serbian War Crimes Chamber for the murder of two Muslim civilians, Husein Grbic et Refic Velic and attempt to murder a third one, Dcemal Hadlic, while being a member of the Sixth Krajina Brigade of the Republika Srspka Army.
The event took place in a bar in Stari Majdan, in the municipality of Sanski Most, in the evening of 21 December 1992.
After a verbal clash with Grbic and Velic originated by a story of revenge and national hatred, Malic took Husein Grbic out of the bar and murdered him by stabbing him with a sharp object in the right side of his neck and by firing a shot to his chest. Grbic died of a hemorrhage shortly after.
Following this event, Malic returned to the bar and attacked Refik Velic. He took him out and killed him with a shot to the head.
Then Malic took Dcemal Hadlic, dragged him outside where the body of Grbic and Velic were on the ground in the shape of the letter “L”. He ordered him to lay down to form a letter “U”, the symbol of the fascist Ustashi movement, which encouraged the persecution and genocide of Serbs during the Second World War. He was also forced to pronounce outrageous words about his roots. When Hadlic refused to do so, Malic began violently kicking him and hit his head against the wall. When Malic started to unbutton his jacket, in order to take the gun out, Hadlic managed to escape.
Nenad Malic was arrested in Serbia in January 2009.
