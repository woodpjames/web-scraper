facts

Milorad Pejic, an ethnic Serb, was born in Vukovar in Croatia in April 1968.
During the conflict Serbian troops bombarded Vukovar, and an 87-day siege ensued. Following the fall of Vukovar, on 20 November 1991, 198 people who had taken refuge in the hospital, including patients, soldiers, staff and journalists, were rounded up and taken to a pig farm in Ovcara. Some were tortured before they were executed and buried in mass graves. Pejic allegedly took part in the killing of at least 200 Croatian prisoners in the Ovcara massacre when he was a member of the Vukovar territorial defence.
In 2007 the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) convicted two Serb officers, Mile Mrksic and Veselin Sljivancanin (see “related cases”), of taking part in the massacre and sentenced them to twenty and five years in prison respectively. Sljivancanin was cleared of charges of crimes against humanity by the tribunal as it accepted that the killings had not been carried out under his orders but by independent local paramilitaries from a local defence unit. Milorad Pejic is alleged to have been one such paramilitary.
In 1999, following the Balkan conflict, Pejic moved to the United Kingdom, where he was granted indefinite leave to remain. He was eventually granted British citizenship and moved to Corby, Northamptonshire, England where he worked as a locksmith
Pejic was arrested at Nikola Tesla airport in Belgrade on 19th March 2008 when he returned to visit relatives.
