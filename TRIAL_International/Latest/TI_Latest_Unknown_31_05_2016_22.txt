Bernard Ntuyahaga is believed to have been born in 1952 in Mabanza, Kibuye, Rwanda. In 1972, he attended the Kigali school for army officers. At the time of the alleged facts, he held the rank of major.
On 7 April 1994, on the day following the attack on President Juvenal Habyarimanaâ€™s plane, soldiers of the Rwandan Armed Forces surrounded the residence of the Prime Minister, Mrs. Agathe Uwiligiyimana who was being protected by ten Belgian blue helmets and five Ghanaians.
Agathe Uwiligiyimana tried to escape, but was assassinated by the Rwandan soldiers who then captured the blue helmets. The Ghanaians were freed but the ten Belgians were reportedly led to the Kigali military camp where they were massacred in cold blood.
Fearing extradition to Rwanda, Major Ntuyahaga surrendered to the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) in Arusha, Tanzania, in June 1998.
