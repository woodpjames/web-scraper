Civil society is the cornerstone of international justice

Today marks 20 years since the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) was adopted. The ICC receives significant media coverage all over the world, yet its action arises from a far more discreet process: everything starts with unknown individuals determined to bring about change. On this anniversary, let’s celebrate the role of civil society in international justice!
Being closest to the ground, NGOs are often the first to report international crimes and collect testimonies from survivors. Without their help, few victims would be able to reach out to the competent jurisdictions – be it for lack of information or resources, or out of fear of reprisals. These civil society organizations are thus the eyes and ears of the judiciary. Thanks to them, crimes are reported, the first pieces of evidence are gathered, victims are defended, and authorities are held accountable.
Once the proceedings have been initiated, NGOs maintain a fundamental role in investigations and in the representation of victims, especially when the courts are distant – geographically and culturally – from the crime scene.
