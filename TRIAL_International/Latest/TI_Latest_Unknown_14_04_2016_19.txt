facts

Gaspard Ruhumuliza was born on 16 February 1953 in Gitarama, in the centre of Rwanda. Ruhumuliza was appointed minister of trade, industry and handicrafts by President Habyarimana on 31 December 1991. He then held the function of minister of environment and tourism from 1992 to 1994 and then prefect of Kibuge, in western Rwanda. Ruhumuliza also held several management positions, including that of representative, within the Christian Democratic Party.
Ruhumuliza resigned from his the function of minister on 12 June 1994 and left Rwanda to take refuge in Switzerland. On 27 August 1994, he filed an application for asylum in Switzerland. This request was rejected by the Swiss federal office for refugees on 10 February 1997, decision against which Ruhumuliza filed an appeal in 1997.
Ruhumuliza was placed by the Rwandan authorities on the 2006 list of persons suspected of having committed the crime of genocide in Rwanda in 1994 and living abroad. At that time, he was believed to have found refuge in Canada, a piece of information that was proven incorrect after his trace was found in Bern, Switzerland.
Swiss authorities opened an investigation against Ruhumuliza for his alleged role in war crimes in Rwanda before closing the case on 20 Mai 2005.
