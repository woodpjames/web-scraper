Nijaz Hodzic, a Bosnian, was a military policeman with the 108th brigade of the Croatian Defence Council during the autumn of 1992 in the midst of the Yugoslav Civil War.
In this role, Hodzic physically abused, tortured, and treated inhumanely Serbian prisoners of war and Serbian civilians from the Bukvik area of Bosnia and Herzegovina on multiple occasions during 1992 and 1993. Most of these offenses occurred at detention centres established in schools, cooperative housing, and other facilities in and around Bukvik. Hodzic helped maintain poor conditions in the centres. Prisoners were forced to lie on the floor and inadequately fed. He also was known to single out prisoners for beatings.
During the autumn of 1992 at Gornji Rahic, Nijaz Hodzic and an accomplice, Brcko Public Safety Station Crime Police Inspector Galib Hadzic, lined up prisoners and hit them in the face, including one prisoner named Borislav Piperac.
Hodzic was indicted on 15 November 2010.
