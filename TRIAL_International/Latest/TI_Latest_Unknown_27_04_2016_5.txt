facts

Paul Albers was born on 13 September 1919. He was a member of the Hitlerjugend from 1 June 1934 to 11 November 1937. Since 1937 he was a member of the Nazi Party. He received several distinctions, and got involved rapidly into the Nazi hierarchy, where he became a close collaborator of Walter Reder. He was appointed as a SS sub-lieutenant on 10 March 1943, and subsequently as a SS lieutenant on 11 September 1944.
During the occupation of Italy Albers’ squad – the 16th SS-Panzer-Grenadier-Division Reichsführer-SS – was deployed in Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna in order to the fight against the partisans.
Between 19 and 27 August 1944 Albers’ division killed around 350 civilians – including women, children and old persons – in the towns of San Terenzo, Fivizzano and Fosdinovo in Tuscany, as a reprisal for partisans’ operations in the area.
In the framework of an operation against a partisan group known as ‘Stella Rossa’, between 29 September and 5 October 1944 the same SS group massacred around 800 civilians in the area of Monte Sole, around the little town of Marzabotto, in Emilia-Romagna. Entire families were killed, including women, children and old people. Their houses, schools and churches were destroyed.
For around 50 years the crimes in which Paul Albers took part were not prosecuted in Italy. New investigations started in the late 1990s, after that in 1994 new documents concerning the Nazi massacres in Occupied Italy were found in Rome.
On 7 February 2006 by the Military Tribunal of La Spezia indicted Paul Albers for the massacres in the Marzabotto area. For such episodes his direct superior, Walter Reder, had already been sentenced to life imprisonment in 1951. On 12 March 2008 the same court indicted Albers for the crimes committed in the San Terenzo area.
