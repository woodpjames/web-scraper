Sexual violence against males: still taboo
30.04.2018
Over the past several years, sexual violence against males has periodically reached the headlines (Guantánamo, Sri Lanka…). Despite this recent spate of exposure, many male victims remain shrouded in silence, reluctant to come forward due to stigma. Kyle Delbyck, legal consultant for TRIAL International’s BiH program, examines the situation.  
The number of males raped during the conflict in BiH is still unclear. A recent Amnesty International report estimated that 3,000 men and boys had been subjected to sexual violence in detention camps.
As the report specifies, because “men are less likely to report such crimes or speak out about them in public, the number is likely higher”. Under-reporting in BiH largely stems from stigmatization.
