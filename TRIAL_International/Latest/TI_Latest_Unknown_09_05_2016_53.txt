Miodrag Živković is a geological technician who completed Geology High School. He was a member of a Serbian Radical Party volunteer unit during the armed conflict in the former Yugoslavia.
On the evening of 14 June 1992, Živković and three members of his volunteer unit, Dragan Jović, Zoran Đurđević and Alen Ristić allegedly entered a bosniak family house near Bijeljina. They allegedly searched the house, stole their money, jewelry and weapons. They forced the daughter and daughter in law to undress and repeatedly raped them. Živković claimed that he tried to stop the rapes but the other members ignored him so he went outside. Afterwards, the father was killed. Živković, Jović, Đurđević and Ristić then drove his daughter and daughter-in-law, naked and barefoot, to Ljeljenča (Bijeljina municipality), where they allegedly raped and abused the women and left them on the road.
