facts


Luis Abelardo Patti was born in the Buenos Aires province of Baigorrita on 26 November 1952. He began working in a bakery following his primary education. At 16, he joined Buenos Aires’ police academy. On 30 December 1971, he was promoted to the rank of assistant police officer in the town of Escobar.
From 1973 to 1976 he was the Escobar police commissariat’s principal investigator, where he stood out for his mistreatment of detainees and irregularities in proceedings.
On 7 March 1975, he married Beatriz Malagrida. The couple had four children.
In 1975, he worked with the soon-to-be head of the Buenos Aires police force, the general Ramon Camps.
From 1974 to 1977, in liaison with the military intelligence agency, he combed through factories armed with a list of unionists, who he then proceeded to arrest with no motive.
In 1977, he murdered three petty criminals, and then declared they died during a confrontation. The autopsy revealed that the ‘criminals’ had been shot at close range.
In 1983, he was investigated for the deaths of Osvaldo Cambiaso and Eduardo Pereyra Rossi. The charges were dismissed.
From 1983 (end of the dictatorship) to 1992, he worked in various corps of the army and different police commissariats. He was promoted to the rank of inspector, and decorated. The following year, he left the police force and joined the Argentine Justicialist Party. In 1995, he was elected governor of Escobar with 75% of the vote, thanks to an electorate who were swayed by his hard line policies.
In 1999, he established his own party, the PAUFE (Partido Unidad Federalista). He ran for the Buenos Aires governor position and obtained 7,7% of the vote. In 2003, after running again, the figure was 12%.
In 2005, he ran for deputy and won, but the Chamber of Deputies demanded he step down due to his involvement in crimes against humanity following President Kirchner’s repeal of impunity laws.
In 2007 Patti was accused of torture and disappearances, and incarcerated. In 2008, however, the Supreme Court validated his nomination, giving him parliamentary immunity, and he was released. The Chamber of Deputies was immediately asked by a judge to lift this immunity, an event that occurred 3 weeks later. Patti was detained in Marcos Paz prison.
