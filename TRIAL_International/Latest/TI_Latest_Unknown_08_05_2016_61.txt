facts

Zoran Milic is of Bosnian nationality and served as a member of the second battalion of the “Nikola Subic Zrinjksi” brigade of the Croatian Defence Council (HVO) during the Bosnian civil war. It is alleged that on 26 April 1993, Milic alongside Zoran Marinic, also a member of the HVO, participated in the murder and wounding of Bosniak civilians during an attack on their homes in Juriceve Bare hamlet in Busovaca Municipality, in Central Bosnia.
It is believed that on the night of 26 April 1993, Milic and Marinic visited a local family’s house where they threatened to murder the family. Milic is alleged to have held a weapon to a member of the family while Marinic illegally destroyed their property by setting their furniture and house on fire. The co-perpetrators then proceeded to another family home where it is alleged they murdered two members of the family. It is believed that the elderly and disabled persons of the family were killed using arms, fire and a knife. The co-perpetrators further injured three members of the family, two of whom later died as a result of their injuries. Milic and Marinic then destroyed the property of the family by setting the house on fire.
For these acts, both Milic and Marinic were charged by the State Prosecution of Bosnia and Herzegovina for participation in war crimes, namely: the murder of four civilians; the infliction of great physical and psychological pain and suffering and inhumane treatment of other civilians; and the unlawful and arbitrary destruction of property thereof.
