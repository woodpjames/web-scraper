Nepal: Child tortured by policemen receives compensation
09.01.2017
For the first time in Nepal, torturers have been ordered to pay compensation to their victim. Unfortunately, they also still roam free. 
Mr. Tamang was tortured by policemen when he was just 11. He was beaten, electrocuted and forced to “confess” to stealing jewels. When he left the police station, he bore physical and mental scars that would haunt him for the rest of his life. His education prospects, in particular, have been thwarted.
