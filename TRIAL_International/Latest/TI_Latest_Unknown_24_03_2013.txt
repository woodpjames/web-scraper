facts

Onesphore Rwabukombe was born on 1 January 1957 in Kiyombe, in the region of Byumba in Rwanda. He belongs to the Hutu ethnic group.
In 1994, Rwabukombe was a member of the local executive committee of the Rwandan governing party MRND (Mouvement Républicain National pour la Démocratie et le Développement) and mayor of the Muvumba commune in the north of Rwanda.
During the genocide against the Tutsi ethnic minority, which took place between April and July 1994, Rwabukombe was alleged to have incited the Hutu residents of Muvumba to kill Tutsis and was said to have actively participated in the killings in the nearby Murambi district.
In particular, he was accused of being responsible for the death of more than 3’730 people when, on 11 April 1994, he reportedly participated in the massacre in the Kiziguro church. Some 1’200 persons, who had sought refuge in the church, are claimed to have been killed with firearms and other objects following his instructions.
Moreover, he was also accused of having supervised the massacre in the Kabarondo church, on 13 April 1994, during which all the men were induced to come outside of the church and killed with arrows and similar weapons. Subsequently, community police and militias attacked the women, children and older people who had remained in the church, with grenades and other firearms.
Furthermore, it is reported that Rwabukombe ordered the massacre in the Kibungu church (today Ngoma) on 15 April 1994. Around 11’170 persons are believed to have died during this massacre.
In 2002 Rwabukombe left for Germany where he was granted refugee status.
