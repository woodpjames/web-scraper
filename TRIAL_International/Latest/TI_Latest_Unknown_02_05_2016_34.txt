facts

Erich Priebke was born on 29 July 1913 in Hennigsdorf/ Germany. He was a Hauptsturmführer (Captain) in the Waffen-SS. He served under Obersturmbannführer Herbert Kappler (see. “related cases”) in Rome, where he was responsible for liaising with the Italian police.
On 23 March 1944, a bomb planted by the Italian resistance killed 33 German soldiers. As a consequence, Kappler drew up a list of 320 civilians who were to be executed in reprisal. In total, 335 civilians were executed on 24 March 1944 in the Ardeatine Caves near Rome.
During his trial, Priebke confessed to having directed the massacre with the help of a certain Karl Hass.
After the war, Priebke was arrested and imprisoned, but escaped from prison in 1946. Two years later, he found his way to Argentina, where he settled in the region of San Carlos de Bariloche and took on various official posts. This town also became a hide-out for other former Nazi officials such as Hans-Ulrich Rudel, the most highly decorated pilot of the Luftwaffe (air force), or Friedrich Lantschner, the former Nazi Governor of the Tyrol.
However, on 6 May 1994, a documentary on Priebke, made by the journalist Sam Donaldson was screened on the US TV-Station ABC. This showed Priebke talking openly about his involvement in the massacre in the Ardeatine Caves. Reactions followed immediately. Faced with international pressure, the Argentinean authorities arrested Priebke. In view of his advanced age, he was put under house arrest at his Bariloche domicile. Italy immediately requested his extradition on 9 May 1994.
In March 1995, nine months after his arrest, the Argentinean Supreme Court assigned the Priebke case to the authorities in Bariloche.
