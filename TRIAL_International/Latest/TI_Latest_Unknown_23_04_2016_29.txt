facts

Josias Kumpf was an ethnic German born in Nova Pazova in the former Yugoslavia on 7 April 1925. In 1942, when he was 17, he served under the SS guard forces at Sachsenhausen as part of the ‘Death’s Head Guard Battalion’, an SS unit notorious for war crimes and atrocities. About a year later he was transferred to Trawniki concentration camp. There Kumpf allegedly participated in a Nazi operation in November 1943 codenamed “Aktion Erntefest” (Operation Harvest Festival) in which 42,000 Jews were murdered at three Nazi camps in eastern Poland over two days. Kumpf is alleged to have participated in the murder of 8,000 Jews at Trawniki concentration camp on 3 November 1943. His task was to guard a pit where prisoners were shot and ‘finish off’ the wounded once the massacre had ended.
After the war, Kumpf joined his family in Austria. In 1956 Kumpf moved from Austria to the US and settled in Illinois, becoming a US citizen in 1964. He worked as a sausage maker at the Vienna Sausage Company until he retired. After his wife died in 2000, he moved to Wisconsin.
A spokesman for the Justice Department said officials began efforts to deport Kumpf in 2003, when a federal lawsuit was filed in the Eastern District of Wisconsin to strip him of his citizenship because of his alleged participation in war crimes. Kumpf had stated on his visa and citizenship applications only that he had been in the ‘German army’. His citizenship was revoked in 2005 with Kumpf acknowledging his role as a guard at Trawkniki concentration camp. Justice Department officials stated that Josias Kumpf by his own admission stood guard with orders to shoot any surviving prisoners who attempted to escape an SS massacre that left thousands of Jews dead. However, Peter Rogers, Kumpf’s immigration attorney, said that although Kumpf was stationed at Trawniki, “he never laid a finger on anyone, he never shot at anyone.”
Kumpf was deported to Austria in March 2009 at the age of 83.
