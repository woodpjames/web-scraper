Facts

Radomir Marković was born on 11 August 1946 in Lukavac, Bosnia & Herzegovina.
A former member of the homicide division, he was responsible for maintaining order in Belgrade before being appointed head of the State Security Service (SDB) of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, from 1998 until 2001.
During his tenure as head of the SDB, Marković allegedly participated in the murder of Serbian journalist Slavko Ćuruvija on 11 April 1999. The victim was shot in the back 17 times in front of his residence in Belgrade. According to his family and colleagues, Ćuruvija’s killing was motivated by his opposition against the regime of then-Serbian President Slobodan Milošević. Ćuruvija had been designated an enemy of the state due to his public criticism of Milošević and was systematically monitored by state security from 1996.
On 3 October 1999, the convoy of former Deputy Prime Minister of the FRY, Vuk Drašković, was struck by a lorry filled with sand while circulating on the Ibar highway. Marković was suspected of being involved in the planning of the attack, in which four of Drašković’s aides were killed.
In February 2001, Marković was arrested by Yugoslav police and charged with abusing his position in order to organize the attempted assassination of Vuk Drašković.
