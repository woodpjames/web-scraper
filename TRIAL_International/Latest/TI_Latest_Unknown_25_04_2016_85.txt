facts

Alexeï Perelevski is a Russian national. He was a Major in the Russian Special Forces and member of the Special Unit within the Russian Intelligence Service (GRU).
On 11 January 2002 during a control which took place at a roadblock between the villages of Chatoï and Daï located between Chechnya and Dagestan, Captain Edward Oulman, who led a special unit of the Russian Military Intelligence Services (GRU), reportedly ordered his subordinates to fire on a civilian vehicle transporting six people and whose driver had refused the order to stop.
One of the passengers, Saïd Alaskhanov, headmaster of a school in a nearby village, supposedly died instantly. Two of the six passengers were wounded.
The subordinates of Captain Oulman, Sergeant Vladimir Voïevodine and Lieutenant Alexander Kalaganski were reported to have escorted the five survivors to an abandoned farmhouse close by.
Here, they administered first aid to the wounded, keeping them prisoners, whilst Captain Oulman radioed the situation to Major Alexeï Perelevski, who, in turn, transmitted the information to the military commander of the unit. According to the accusation, Major Alexeï Perelevski then transmitted, by radio, a message from the commander to Captain Edward Oulman instructing him to eliminate the civilian prisoners. Oulman then reportedly transmitted this order to his subordinates.
It was alleged that Oulman gave an order to his subordinates to tell the five civilians that they were free to leave but then to execute them as they began to disperse. His subordinates reportedly carried out this order, killing the civilians before putting their bodies in the vehicle and setting it on fire. One of the civilians was said to have escaped, but subsequently succumbed to his injuries.
Captain Edward Oulman, both of his subordinates and Major Alexeï Perelevski were indicted following these events which took place 11 January 2002.
