According to human rights organizations, the Bahraini authorities systematically use torture, and the Bahraini Attorney General’s Office plays a significant role in this repressive system. Those arrested are often subjected to torture and forced to sign false confessions.
The annual conference of the International Association of Prosecutors (AIP) was held in Zurich in September 2015. Among the members of the AIP’s Executive Committee attending the conference was the Attorney General of Bahrain, Mr Ali Bin Fadhul Al-Buainain.
The NGOs TRIAL International, ECCHR, REDRESS and BIRD reported Mr Al-Buainain and supported the filing of a complaint by Mr Jaafar Al-Hasabi. This human rights defender states that he was a victim of torture and was forced to sign false confessions during an investigation by Mr Al-Buainain’s services. The latter had personally given the order to have the victim detained incommunicado.
Berne’s Public Prosecutor, which has jurisdiction to handle this case, opened a criminal investigation of the Attorney General on September 15, 2015, for the crime of torture. However, the Public Prosecutor did not wish to have the suspect arrested. The investigation is ongoing.
It is the first time that a criminal investigation of a senior Bahraini official has been opened for acts of torture, and it is the first universal jurisdiction case concerning Bahrain.
