Deng Delyun (also known by the name Peng Pelyun) was Chinese Family Planning Minister in the 1990s. He was in chage of putting the “two children” policy into practice in Tibet since 1984, before the rigorous policy of “one child” was put in place by China in Tibet in 1999.
Delyun along with seven former high-ranked Chinese politicians are suspected of having committed or ordered the following crimes, committed in Tibet between 1971 and 1998:
-Genocide (including torture, forced abortions, sterilisations and displacement of Tibetan people, along with the murder of more than a million people from Tibet)

-Torture (14 charges, as well as the ill-treatment of political prisoners in Drachi and Gutsa, penal institutions in Lhasa, Tibet)
-Terrorism
