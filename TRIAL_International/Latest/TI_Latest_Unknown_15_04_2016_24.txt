Carlos José Leonardo López Tapia was born in Chile in 1932. He is a former Colonel at Dina (the national intelligence agency) in Chile.
On 11 September 1973, General Pinochet succeeded in a coup d’état and brought a military junta in to rule Chile. During the 17 years of the dictatorship, parliament was closed, the media were systematically censored and political opponents were kidnapped, tortured and murdered. Over 3000 people were murdered and around 100 others disappeared under the dictatorship.
López Tapia was a member of the “Caravan of Death”, a group from the Chilean army that travelled Chile in 1973 and had as its mission “to accelerate trials and standardise the criteria for administering justice” for those who had been detained following Pinochet’s military coup. These soldiers brutally executed political prisoners and buried them in unmarked graves. Among others, López was involved in the extrajudicial killing of José Liendo Vera, the leader of the Movement of the Revolutionary Left (MIR in Spanish), on 3 October 1973.
In 1976, López was the head of “Villa Grimaldi”, a clandestine torture centre where it is estimated that some 4500 people were detained between 1974 and 1978. Among those detained at the centre were the ex-member of parliament for the Communist Party, Bernardo Araya Zuleta, and his wife, María Olga Flores Barraza. Their bodies were never found. López also participated in the “Calle Conferencia” cases, in which members of the secret leaders of the Communist Party Mario Zamorano, Jogre Muñoz, Elisa Escobar, Uldarico Donaire, Jaime Donato, Lenín Díaz and Víctor Díaz, were detained, from the 21 May 1976, and killed.
On 12 January 1998 a lawsuit was brought against López for the aggravated kidnapping of Bernardo Araya Zuleta and María Flores Barraza on 2 April 1976 in the region of Valparaíso.
