Repression in Burundi, arrest in the DRC
03.07.2017
Journalist Egide Mwemero was tortured in the DRC for “crimes” committed in Burundi – a case that illustrates the silencing of media outlets in the region.
African Public Radio (RPA), one of the most popular media outlets in Burundi, has been in the government’s line of fire since the beginning of the crisis. Its headquarters were ransacked and many journalists had to flee the country. The director of RPA, Bob Rugurika, was also entangled in legal troubles.
But RPA journalists, even those living in exile, continued to make their voices heard. In October 2015, they created the program Humura so they could continue informing their fellow citizens. Thanks to a partnership with the Congolese station Le Messager du Peuple (the People’s Messenger) – which broadcasts from Uvira, a city close to the Congolese-Burundian border – listeners in Burundi can tune into Humura.
