Facts

Mohamed Morsi was born on 20 August 1951 in Egypt, north of Cairo. He moved to the United States to study at the University of Southern California, where he received a Ph.D. in 1982. He became a member of the Muslim Brotherhood in 1977.
Morsi began his political career in 2000 when he was elected as a Member of Parliament – technically as an independent since the Muslim Brotherhood could not run candidates – serving until 2005. In 2011, he was elected president of the Freedom and Justice Party, the political wing of the Muslim Brotherhood, which he helped found that same year. Morsi and numerous other Brotherhood leaders were arrested in January 2011 under the regime of Hosni Mubarak, but they escaped days later in a mass prison break. On 25 January 2011, Egyptians began protesting the Mubarak government in what is known as the Egyptian Revolution, and President Mubarak resigned on 11 February 2011.
On 24 June 2012, Morsi became the first democratically-elected President of Egypt. He immediately resigned from the Muslim Brotherhood, as he had promised to do during the campaign.
In November 2012, Morsi issued a decree granting himself extraordinary powers; in response, anti-Morsi protesters began to gather outside the Presidential Palace in early December 2012. Freedom and Justice Party officials reacted to the protests by calling for Muslim Brotherhood supporters to arrest and detain the anti-Morsi protesters, and violent clashes broke out between both sides. Opposition protesters were unlawfully detained and allegedly beaten and mistreated by Morsi supporters while security forces stood by. It was reported that ten people were killed in the violence, including Muslim Brotherhood members, and 748 injured.
In June 2013, after only a year in power, millions of protesters started calling for Morsi’s resignation. On 3 July 2013, Morsi was ousted from power by the Egyptian military, led by Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.
After his ousting, Morsi was arrested and held incommunicado for several months. He has since been put on trial for various charges, including inciting the killing of protesters, torture, espionage, and breaking out of prison.
