facts

Rubén Alcides Codina (aka ‘El Negro’) was born on 8 April 1940 in Alta Valcheta, in the Rio Negro province, Argentina.
Codina worked as commanding detective in the Rio Negro province during the operation conducted by the Latin American dictatorships, including Argentina, of the Operation Condor. It is in this context of cleansing of political opponents, particularly communists, that Daniel Orlando Avalos and Carlos Apolinario Lima have been arrested on 2 April 1976. They have subsequently been interrogated and beaten, especially Lima, who suffered physical injuries. Both victims were members of the ‘Unión Obrera de la Constucción de la Republica Argentina’, a left wing union still active nowadays in Argentina.
Orlando Avalos has been arrested at his house by Codina and his colleague Victor Manuel Lobos on 2 April 1976. Apolinario Lima surrendered voluntarily directly to the police station on the same day. Both men have been transferred to the police station of Viedma, the capital city of the Rio Negro province, on 5 April 1976. There, they have been interrogated and suffered physical violence.
Orlando Avalos has been freed on 20 April 1976, and Lima on 5 July that same year. The latter suffered from physical injuries inflicted to him during interrogation.
Codina and his accomplices were initially shielded from prosecution by the full stop law (‘Ley de Puto Final’) and the due obedience law (‘Ley de Obedienca Debida’). Their indictment has been made possible after the Argentinean Constitutional Court declared these laws null and void in 2005, due to their unconstitutionality
Subsequently to the suppression of the amnesty laws, Orlando Avalos and Apolonario Lima have been able to renew their complaints against Codina and six other suspects. Therefore, a public trial has been conducted in Viedma from 19 June to 28 July 2011.
