facts

José Efraín Ríos Montt was born on 16 June 1926. He began his military career in 1946 as a cadet and was made general in 1972. Between 1970 and 1974 he was chief of the Guatemalan army. In 1974 he was elected president as a candidate of the Christian Democratic Party, but the candidate of the armed forces, general Kjell Laugerud, deposed him and sent him into exile.
On 23 March 1982 Ríos Montt became de facto president in a coup d’état, deposing General Fernando Lucas Garcia. He initially established a three-member military junta before assuming total control. During his rule, Ríos Montt installed a military regime, dissolved the congress, and suspended the constitution, replacing it with the Fundamental Statute of Guatemala (Estatuto Fundamental de Guatemala, Decree law 24-82). His era was characterized by massacres against the Indian population and the destruction of 440 Indian villages. Hundreds of thousands of victims were buried in secret mass graves.
Ríos Montt ruled the country for over sixteen months until he was overthrown by a subsequent military coup by his then Minister of Defense Oscar Humberto Mejia Victores on 8 August 1983.
In 1989, he founded the Guatemalan Republican Front (Frente Republicano Guatemalteco, or FRG) party. In 1990, he ran unsuccessfully for president and failed on constitutional grounds. The same year he was elected to congress and served until 2004.
