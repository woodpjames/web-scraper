Walikale case: time for accountability for warlord Ntabo “Sheka” Ntaberi
27.11.2018
The long-awaited trial of two Congolese rebel leaders opened on 27 November 2018 in Goma, North Kivu. Ntabo Ntaberi faces charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity, along with his co-defendant, former FDLR leader “Lionceau”. Collaborating with several local and international actors supporting the Congolese justice system, TRIAL International has worked to facilitate access to justice to the two men’s hundreds of victims. 
The judges will have to determine the role the two warlords have played in the attack of numerous villages in the territories of Walikale and Masisi from 2010 to 2014. This zone in the North Kivu province was the battleground of several militias, resulting in mass murder, sexual violence, recruitment and use of child solider and pillages – among other crimes.
Ntabo Ntaberi, who also goes by the war name “Sheka”, was the commander of one of those militias, the Nduma Defence of Congo (NDC). Himself and another warlord, Séraphin Nzitondaknown as “Lionceau”, are now facing justice before the Operational Military Court of North Kivu.
