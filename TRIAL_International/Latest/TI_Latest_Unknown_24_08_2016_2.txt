Facts

Jelic was a General in the Croatian Army and Croatian Defence Council (HVO). He is accused of participating in an ethnic cleansing campaign and the persecution of Bosniak civilians in the Mostar area between May 1993 and March 1994. In his capacity as the commander of the First Active Battalion of the HVO’s military police and the First Light Assault Battalion of the military police, he is accused of being responsible of crimes against humanity, in particular against civilian prisoners who were allegedly forced to work on the front-line in Mostar.
It is reported that Jelic is charged with giving orders to the commander of the Heliodrom detention camp in Mostar to take detainees to the front-line in and around Mostar and to use forced labour from May 1993 to March 1994. It is alleged that 50 detainees were killed and 188 were wounded, while about 40 were allegedly tortured.
After the end of the war, he received a position as commander of the Bosnian Army’s First Croatian Guards Corps, but was suspended by the commander of NATO’s Stabilisation Force (SFOR) over an alleged ethical violation. He then became influential figure in the Bosnian football as a manager of the Siroki Brijeg football club and a member of the executive board of the Football Association of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Jelic left Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2012, moving to Croatia with his family and renounced to his Bosnian citizenship.
