Philip DeCamp, born in 1963 in Georgia, joined the US army in 1983. He obtained a bachelorâ€™s degree in physics in 1984, and a Ph.D. in industrial engineering. He was lieutenant colonel of the 3rd Infantry Division of the US army in Iraq when the alleged facts occurred. He retired from the Army in July 2005 and became adjunct mathematics professor in Virginia.
On the morning of 8 April 2003, Sergeant Shawn Gibson, the commander of a 3rd Infantry Division M-1 Abrams tank positioned on the Al-Jumhuriya Bridge in Bagdad fired on the Palestine Hotel, a base from where numerous foreign journalists covered the Iraq war. Jose Couso, a cameraman for the Spanish network Telecinco, and Taras Protsyuk, a Ukrainian cameraman for Reuters, were killed after the tank fired the high-explosive shell at the Palestine Hotel.
DeCamp headed the regiment in charge of the tank which attacked the building.
A U.S. military investigation in August 2003 cleared DeCamp and the other two soldiers, Sergeant Shawn Gibson and Captain Philip Wolford, of wrongdoing, saying they acted properly because they believed they were firing on enemy troops.
Yet, another investigation from the Committee to Protect Journalists underlined that no evidence was found of enemy shot coming from the Palestine Hotel. However, this investigation concluded to the non-intentionality of the crimes.
