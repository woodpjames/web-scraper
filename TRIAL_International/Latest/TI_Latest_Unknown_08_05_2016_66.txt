Frano Vulic was born on 23 November 1968 in Imotski, Croatia. He was, during the period of the cimres that he is accused of, a member of the Third Company in the Fifth Battalion of the Military Police of the Croatian Defence Council (HVO).
On 14 July 1993, Vulic was in charge of guarding the entrance of a hangar at the Dretelj prison camp near Capljina in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Knowing that around 200 Bosnians were locked in this hangar, he fired the gun through one of the windows, thus killing three prisoners – Hasan, Izet and Omer Duvnjak, all members of the same family.
Kresimir Bogdanovic, commander of the Second Company in the same Battalion, saw Vulic right after the shooting. According to Bogdanovic, the latter still had his gun and seemed anxious.
On 7 February 2013, Vulic was arrested in the Grude region by the Department of Investigation and State Protection on the orders of the Prosecutor’s Office of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
