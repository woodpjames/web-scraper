Lemera
17.05.2016
On 8 August 2010, during the “KIMIA II” military operations carried out by the Congolese army against the rebel group Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), around 10 members of the army captured and raped seven women in a village near Lemera in the South Kivu Province.
The military court of first instance convicted five of these soldiers. In addition, the court considered the Congolese State civilly liable for the crimes, ordering it to compensate the victims.
However, the Congolese government showed a lack of willingness in this case to compensate the victims of international crimes. In fact, none of the reparations determined by the court was implemented, and none of the victims received anything. Sadly, this practice is very common: in 2016, none of the victims of similar cases has ever received any compensation from the State.
Convinced of the need to keep fighting, TRIAL International submitted the file for the granting of reparations to the competent authorities in Kinshasa in June 2015. After a year of endless procedures and negotiations with the relevant authorities, still no compensation has been paid. TRIAL International lodged a complaint before the Human Rights Committee in the summer 2016 to engage the State’s responsibity for its failure to act.
TRIAL International is the first actor in DRC to support victims of international crimes in complex and costly proceedings aiming to secure reparations from the Congolese State. Besides the benefit to the victims, a successful outcome in these proceedings would represent a very important precedent for the reparation of all victims of international crimes in DRC.
