facts

Jovan Divjak was born in 1937 in Belgrade to parents originally from Bosanska Krajina (a region in Bosnia).
Divjak completed his military studies in 1959 and served in the former Yugoslav Peopleâ€™s Army (JNA), mostly in the military education sector. In 1991, Divjak was court-marshalled by the JNA for supporting the Kiseljak Territorial Defense. The Territorial Defenses were a separate part of the armed forces of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia that, during the war, turned into separatist paramilitaries.
Because of his collaboration with the Territorial Defense, Divjak was sentenced by a military court to nine months imprisonment. He avoided this sentence by leaving the JNA.
On 8 April 1992, Divjak became the Deputy Commander of the Territorial Defense Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina and a month later he oversaw the defense of Sarajevo from a major JNA attack, known as the Dobrovoljacka Street Attack.
During this attack on 2 and 3 May 1992, the Yugoslav Army tried to take control of Sarajevo. It was later claimed that Yugoslav 42 soldiers were killed in the attack. The captives were held in camps in Sarajevo for months.
In March 2011, Divjak was arrested in Vienna airport due to a Serbian warrants for crimes committed on Bosnian territory during the 1992 to 1995 war. In particular Serbian authorities requested his extradition on charges related to the crimes committed during the Dobrovoljacka Street Attack. Serb prosecutors claimed that 42 soldiers were killed in the attack. Divjak was one of 14 Bosnian officials charged by Serbia over the Dobrovoljacka attack.
