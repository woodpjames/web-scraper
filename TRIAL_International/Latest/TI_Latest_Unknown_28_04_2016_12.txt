facts

Mitar Rašević was born on 15 November 1949 in the village of Cagust (Čagošta) in the municipality of Foča in Bosnia and Herzegovina. He taught sociology. Before, during and after the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, he served as prison guard commander in KP Dom, 35 miles to the south-east of Sarajevo, near the border with Montenegro.
From the beginning of April 1992 until mid-July 1992, Serb military forces took control and occupied the town of Foča and the surrounding villages. The Serbian authorities arrested Muslim villagers and separated men and women. Thousands of Muslim men and non-Serbs were illegally detained in KP Dom from April 1992 to October 1994, which, according to the indictment, had all the characteristics of a detention camp. Most of the 760 detainees were Muslim civilians between 16 and 80 years of age, including the mentally and physically disabled and people with serious illnesses, who were not accused of any crime.
Mitar Raševic held the post of commander of the KP Dom guards before the war, and until October 1994. His main duty was the supervision of at least 37 prison guards and he was also in charge of those detained in solitary confinement cells. He was alleged to have taken part in the establishment and operation of a system of punishment and abuse of detainees. Mitar Raševic reportedly ordered the guards and both military and civil police officers to question detainees on possible weapons caches and permitted the use of force whilst doing so.
Between 18 April 1992 and 31 October 1994, Mitar Raševic was said to have helped to promote and maintain deplorable living conditions for detainees and to have participated in the formation of a system of forced labour. Between June 1992 and March 1993, at least two hundred detainees were deported and moved to unknown locations.
Mitar Rašević was arrested and transferred to the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) on 15 August 2003.
