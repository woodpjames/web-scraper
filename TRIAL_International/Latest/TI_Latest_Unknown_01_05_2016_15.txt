Hans Frank was born on 23 May 1900 in Karlsruhe. He obtained his Doctorate in Law in 1926, and became a lawyer, then legal advisor to Adolf Hitler. He joined the NSDAP, the Nazi party, and participated in the SA. He headed the legal affairs office of the party’s supreme leadership. In 1930, he became a member of the Reichstag, the German Parliament.
In 1939, Hans Frank was appointed Head of the Civilian Administration of the occupied territories with the title of Governor General, a post he held until 1945. He had under his jurisdiction the central region of Poland which neither the Germans nor the Russians had annexed (and which was specifically referred to as the “General Government”).
Frank was also a General in the SS, Reich Minister without Portfolio, Reich Commissar for the Coordination of Justice, and held different other functions.
Frank was accused of using the foregoing positions, his personal influence, and his intimate connection with the Fuehrer in such a manner that: he promoted the accession to power of the Nazi conspirators and the consolidation of their control over Germany as set forth in count 1 of the Indictment. He was also accused of authorizing directing and participating in war crimes as set forth in count 3 of the Indictment and of crimes against humanity as set forth in count four of the Indictment, including, in particular, war crimes and crimes against humanity perpetrated during his administration of the occupied territories.
He was arrested by American troops on 4 May 1945.
