CRIMES IN BERAK, EASTERN CROATIA
In 1991 Momic was a member of the Berak Territorial Defence. Allegedly, between 2 September and the end of autumn 1991, he participated in activities of systematic psychological and physical abuse of the civilian population in Berak, Eastern Slavonia. The aim of these activities, carried out jontly with other members of the Territorial Defence, was to force the remaining non-Serb civiliians out of the village in order to make it a Serb-ethnic area. According to an indictment,the Territorial Defence members imprisoned approximately 120 non-Serb civilians in a detention camp established for that purpose in one of the houses in the village. The detainees were beaten and some were killed.
CRIMES IN TRNOVO
Momic is suspected of having taken part in the killing of six young Bosniacs, three of whom were minors, near Trnovo. In 2007, four other Scorpions, including their leader Slobodan Medic, were convicted for these killings. Momic was absent as he had fled Serbia. A central piece of evidence in this trial was a video recorded by the Scorpions themselves that was produced for the first time during the trial of Slobodan Milosevicin 2005. This video features the Scorpions, humiliating, torturing and killing the six young Bosniacs near the city of Trnovo on 17 July 1995. The victims’ bodies were burnt after the execution.
Momic was arrested in France on 31 January 2011 pursuant to an international arrest warrant issued by Serbia.
On 5 February 2011 Croatia announced that it would request from France his extradition for crimes committed in Berak. While it was reported on 24 March 2011 that the French judiciary had agreed to extradite Momic to Serbia, on 2 September 2011 he was extradited to Croatia.
