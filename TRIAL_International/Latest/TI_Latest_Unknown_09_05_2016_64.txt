Nikola Ivankovic was born on 27 May 1959 in Vladislavci, Osijek-Baranja County, Croatia. He finished his secondary education and completed his army service from 1978 to 1979 in the Yugoslav National Army in Podgorica (part of today’s Montenegro). When the crimes of which he is accused were committed, Ivankovic was a soldier serving in the Croatian Army, member of the 1st Battalion, 2nd Infantry Company of the 130th Brigade.
On 11 December 1991, Ivankovic and Enes Viteskic, along with several other persons, carried out an alleged act of revenge in the village of Paulin Dvor, Croatia following the alleged killing of their comrade, Ilija Ravnjak, by Serbs. Ivankovic and the others entered the home of Andrija Bukvic, where Serb members of the community were staying. Ivankovic, Viteskic and the others attacked with automatic rifles and hand grenades. Nineteen civilians were allegedly killed in the attack. Most of the victims were elderly and nine were women. The house was blown up the next day.
The Croatian army allegedly transported the bodies of 18 of the victims to a warehouse in Lug under the control of the Croatian military where they were hidden until January 1997. The bodies were then buried in a mass grave in Rizvanusa. The bodies were found in Rizvanusa on 13 May 2002. The nineteenth victim was found in Paulin Dvor.
The indictment charging Ivankovic and Enes Viteskic with the war crime of killing civilians was issued on 12 March 2003 by the Osijek County State Attorney’s Office. Ivankovic as well as Viteskic have denied participation in the crime. On 9 June 2003 the trial against Ivankovic and Viteskic opened in Osijek County Court, Croatia.
