facts

Refik Saric is a Bosnian Muslim.
Refik Saric had been a Muslim prisoner at Dretelj (a Croat-run prison camp in Bosnia) from 1 July to 20 August 1993. At this prison, after time, he was granted the status of «higher prisoner” by his Croat warders and offered a special job in the prison’s kitchen. During this period, he volunteered to assist the guards in mistreating his fellow inmates, perhaps out of fear for his own life.
Refik Saric fled to Denmark with his family in January 1994, where he applied for political asylum.
He was arrested on 16 February 1994.
