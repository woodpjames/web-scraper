facts

Ivan Korade was born on 17 December 1963 in Velika Veternička, a Croatian village north of Zagreb.
Before the start of the conflict in the former Yugoslavia, he worked as a central heating installer. He began his military career in 1991, volunteering for a special operations police unit. After the formation of the Croatian National Guard, he eventually became a battalion commander in 1992. He was badly injured in Dubrovnik in 1992, losing his left arm. He returned to duty after only a two week recovery period, becoming the first commander of the 7th Guards Brigade, also known as the “Pumas,” in 1993. His brigade fought against the Bosnian Serb Army of Republika Srpska in western Bosnia and Herzegovina in September 1995. His long history of violent behaviour resulted in his forced retirement at the rank of Major General in 1997.
In 2007, Croatian authorities were informed that Korade, while commanding the 7th Guards Brigade, had ordered the killing of Bosnian Serb Army war prisoners near Glamoč during the September 1995 offensive in western Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Korade was never tried, however, as he reportedly committed suicide on 3 April 2008 after a standoff with police officers who sought to question him regarding a quadruple murder, unrelated to the alleged crimes during the war in Croatia, committed in his village of Velika Veternička on 27 March 2008.
