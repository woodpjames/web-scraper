Takasumi Oka was born in 1890.
He graduated from the Naval Academy in 1911 and from the Naval Staff College in 1923. He began his career in the Navy as a submariner, and held various assignments between the two wars. Before the war broke out in the Pacific, he had reached the grade of Vice-Admiral and had become a political and military specialist in the Navy Ministry.
In October 1940, Takasumi Oka was promoted to Rear Admiral and became Chief of the naval affairs bureau of the Navy Ministry, a position he held until July 1944. In this position, he was able to exert a certain influence over the Liaison Conference during which Japanese policy was decided. He was also alleged to have participated in the formation and execution of the policy to wage aggressive wars against China and the Western powers.
Takasumi Oka was reportedly opposed to the Tripartite Pact, between the Axis powers. Later, he was also reported to have supported the withdrawal of Japanese troops from China in order to appease the United-States.
In his position as Admiral, he was alleged to have ordered his men to kill shipwrecked allied seamen.
He was a proponent of the idea that Japan attack the most important allied bases in Hawaii and Australia. It was also Takasumi Oka who negotiated the support of the army for the Port Moresby operation which led to the battle of the Coral Sea.
Takasumi Oka was arrested at the end of the war and indicted by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East.
