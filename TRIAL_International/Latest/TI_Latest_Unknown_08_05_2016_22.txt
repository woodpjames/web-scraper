facts 


Radoje Lalović was born on 15 July 1946 in Kalinovik, Bosnia and Herzegovina. From early May to 16 December 1992, he was warden at the Butmir Penal and Correctional Institution (Butmir KPD) in Kula, Ilidža Municipality, Bosnia and Herzegovina. During this time, the Serb Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, later Republika Srpska, directed a widespread and systematic attack against the non-Serb civilians of the city of Sarajevo.
Together with his deputy warden, Soniboj Škiljević, Lalović was responsible for Butmir KPD, and for the actions of its guards. In addition to its primary purpose as a regular prison, the Butmir KPD also functioned as a camp where non-Serb civilians were detained from May to December 1992.
Hundreds of non-Serbs, particularly Bosniaks, were detained at Butmir KPD in inhumane conditions, staying in overcrowded rooms with no heating during the winter, provided with very little food and deprived of medical care. Detainees were not informed of the reason for their detention, and no legal proceedings were ever initiated against them.
Non-Serb detainees at the Butmir KPD were also subjected to physical abuse, harsh interrogations and forced labor. Some of them were killed while performing forced labour. Some prisoners were also taken to unknown locations and executed.
On 30 December 2008, the Prosecutor’s Office of Bosnia and Herzegovina issued an indictment against Lalović and Škiljević. They were charged with crimes against humanity, specifically persecution, including murder, enslavement, imprisonment, torture, and other inhumane acts, for their role in the Butmir KPD. The indictment was confirmed on 31 December 2008.
