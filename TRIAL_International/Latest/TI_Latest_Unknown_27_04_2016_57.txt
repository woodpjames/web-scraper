facts

Nikolai Tess was born in 1921 in Yekaterinburg, Russia. At the end of his studies, he joined the Red Army in 1939 and participated in the war against Finland and World War II. Following two serious injuries, he was assigned to the Army Reserve.
In May 1945, when the USSR occupied the Baltic States, he was sent to Latvia by Soviet authorities as a translator for the People’s Commissariat for Internal Affairs (secret services – NKVD). He was recalled to Moscow in January 1946 to study Swedish in the Ministry of State Security’s school. He graduated in 1947 and was promoted to Lieutenant.
In December 1947, Nikolai Tess was sent back to Latvia to serve as interpreter for Latvia SSR’s Ministry of State Security. Soon after, he was assigned to the Ministry’s second division, in charge of counter espionage, as a special investigator.
In this position, he played an active role in the deportation of 138 people. Nikolai Tess drafted and signed 42 administrative deportation orders, for the deportation of 42 Latvian peasant families, as part of the great deportation operation of Latvian peasants on 25 March 1949. In total, 157 persons, including 57 women and 48 children, were affected by this mass deportation, but 14 of them were absent when the Soviet secret service agents executed the decisions. The remaining 138 individuals were reportedly taken to camps in Siberia, where they lived under inhumane conditions. At least 11 people died, including a five- month-old baby and an 80-year-old grandmother.
Nikolai Tess left the USSR States Security System and returned to civilian life in 1954/55.
In 1977, he received the status of second category disabled veteran and retired. In 2001, his status was reclassified to first category, the most serious category.
On 19 March 1998, the Latvian Prosecutor General’s Office opened a preliminary investigation into Nikolai Tess’s activities between February and March 1949, when he was in responsible for the Latvian Ministry of State Security. He was indicted for Crimes against Humanity and Genocide on 21 March 2001.
