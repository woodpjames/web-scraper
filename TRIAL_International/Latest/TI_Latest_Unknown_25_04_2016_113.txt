facts

Branko Vlačo was born in 1953 in Bosnia and Herzegovina. He was a wartime member of the local Serb forces from Vogošća.
Knowing of the widespread and systematic attack of Serb forces attacking the civilian population, Vlačo acted with discriminatory intent in the implementation of the common goal to implement the state policy and thereby persecute Bosniak and Croat population of the municipalities of Vogošća, Ilijaš, Centar and other municipalities of Sarajevo City.
Therefore, Vlačo was the manager of the “Bunker”, “Sonja”, “Planjina Kuca” and “Nakina Garaza” illegal detention camps from May 1992 to October 1992, where he established a punishment system to abuse prisoners, of whom there were around 800, all non-Serb civilians (mostly Croats and Muslims). Also, he personally participated in the transfer of civilians from other facilities to the said camps. In those camps, civilians were held in inhumane conditions, forced to sleep on concrete and use a bucket as a toilet. A woman held with the men in the Bunker also had to live in these conditions. Furthermore, the prisoners were forced to do hard labour and they were taken in groups of between 30 and 50 people to the frontlines during the war to be used as human shields. Around 300 of the detainees were killed at the camps while Vlačo was manager there, and 60 people are still missing from them.
Vlačo was arrested in Montenegro in August 2012 on the basis of an international warrant issued at the request by the Prosecution of Bosnia and Herzegovina. He was extradited to Bosnia and Herzegovina in mid-January 2013 and has been under the custody of the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina ever since.
