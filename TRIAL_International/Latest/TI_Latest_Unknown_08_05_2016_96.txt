facts


Milan Peric was born on 7 June 1961. He served as a police officer in the public security unit of the Kalinovak Police (SJB). He was accused of having persecuted and facilitated the persecution of the Bosnian population of the Kalinovik region whilst he was one of the people in charge of the police patrol.
On 25 June 1992, during an attack on some villages in this region, along with three other co-accused members of the same police unit who were also members of the Serbian Republican Army, Peric arrested Bosnian civilians of these villages. Several men who were arrested in these attacks were then imprisoned in a detention centre and killed.
On 1 August 1992, these same members attacked a village, knowing that only women, elderly people and children would be there at that time. They burnt down several houses and arrested the population, then transferred these civilians to a camp where five of them were killed.
For these acts, Peric was accused of crimes against humanity for having taken part in a wide-spread systematic attack on the civilian population, having helped with and participated in the persecution of this population. He detained them illegally, let attacks end with the death of civilians, used measures of intimidation and arbitrarily destroyed property.
