facts 

Milan Simic was born on 9 August 1960 in Sarajevo. An economist by profession, he had been employed by several companies in the Bosanski Samac region. He had also been President of the Executive Council of the Bosanski Samac Assembly from 30 May 1992 until 24 June 1993, around which date he is said to have relinquished this position after having been seriously wounded by a bullet during an assassination attempt.
He was indicted for planning, instigating and ordering, in collusion with other political figures, a campaign of persecutions between 1 September and 31 December 1993,whose aim was to get rid of the non- Serbian population living in the Municipalities of Bosanski Samac and Odzak. The Serbian authorities in so doing arrested and imprisoned a large number of individuals and forced many civilians to abandon their homes. They also disseminated discriminatory rules and regulations concerning the non-Serbs, insisted that the great majority of them be put into forced labour and undertook a large scale appropriation of their personal and commercial property.
In carrying out this project, Milan Simic reportedly committed serious violations of international humanitarian law, most notably acts of torture.
Before 17 April 1992, the Municipality of Bosanski Samac was made up of close to 17’000 Muslims and Croatians living in Bosnia against an overall population of around 33’000. In May 1995, there remained less than 300.
Milan Simic surrendered voluntarily on 14 February 1998 and was transferred on the following day to the ICTY (International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia).
