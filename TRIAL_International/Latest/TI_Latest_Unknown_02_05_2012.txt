facts

Anton Tittjung was born in Erdud, Yugoslavia (now part of Croatia) on 17 November 1924.
He joined the Waffen SS in October 1942 and served as an SS trooper until the end of World War II.
Tittjung was allegedly a member of the Totenkopf-Sturmbann (Death’s Head Battalion), where he operated as an armed guard at the Nazi-operated Mauthausen concentration camp and its sub-camp Gross Raming in occupied Austria.
Following the end of the War Tittjung applied for and obtained a visa to enter the United States pursuant to the Displaced Persons Act of 1948, without making a reference to his association with the concentration camps or his position within the Waffen SS.
Tittjung was naturalised in 1974 and became a citizen of the United States.
A federal judge in Milwaukee stripped him of his U.S. citizenship in December 1990 after ruling that he had lied about his employment at the Mauthausen concentration camp. In 1994 an immigration court ordered Tittjung to be deported to Croatia for the crime of persecution of concentration camp prisoners. Tittjung appealed on the grounds that he had received an unfair hearing, including being forbidden from introducing evidence pertaining to discrepancies in the account of events as told by a witness from the Mauthausen camp. The Supreme Court found that a fair hearing had taken place and allowed the deportation order to stand. However the Supreme Court declined to hear Tittjung’s final appeal in 2000 and he still lives in Kewaunee, Wisconsin.
A lawsuit was filed in June 2008 with the National Court in Spain by Brussels-based Equipo Nizkor, acting on behalf of victims from the concentration camps of Flossenberg, Sachsenhausen, and Mauthausen, with assistance provided by the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Jerusalem.
