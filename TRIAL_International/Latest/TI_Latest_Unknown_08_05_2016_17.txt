facts

Nedjeljko Kuljic, originally from Simijova region of Bileca, is a Serb from Bosnia. He was a member of the public security station in Bileca where he was a police officer during the Bosnian war between 1992 and 1995.
He is under investigation, predominantly, for events which took place from June to December in 1992 when members of the public security station in Bileca mistreated and tortured Bosnian and Croatian civilians because of their nationality or religious beliefs.
Kuljic is accused, along with Zeljko Ilic in their capacity as police officers, of physical and emotional mistreatment, torture and murder of detainees of the public security station in Bileca, as well as other civilians who were detained in the Bileca student dormitories. These acts formed part of a larger, systematically targeted attack against the Bosnian and Croatian people. The attack was led by the army of the Serbian Republic of Bosnia in the Bileca region.
A prosecutor from the Special Department for War Crimes of Bosnia Herzegovina indicted Kuljic in January 2014. His trial began on 17 June 2014 and he was accompanied by Goran Vujovic, head of the public security station in Bileca, Miroslav Duka, a police commander, and Zeljko Ilic, another police officer.
