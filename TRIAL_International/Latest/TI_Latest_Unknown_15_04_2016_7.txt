facts

Heinrich Nordhorn was born on 12 November 1919 in Hattingen/Ruhr in Germany. He joined the German army (Wehrmacht) and rose to the rank of Lieutenant.
When the Wehrmacht occupied Italy in 1943, after the country had surrendered to the Allies, Nordhorn’s unit moved into the northern part of Italy. In summer 1944 Nordhorn’s troops were stationed near the village of Forli. On 28 August 1944 an explosive device detonated and injured a German soldier in the village of Branzolino. The Germans accused Italian partisans of having staged the attack. The following day Nordhorn and some of his soldiers went to the hostage prison they had installed in Forli in a former children’s hospital. There they randomly picked four prisoners and executed them in the spot where the detonation had taken place the previous day. They forced the villagers of Branzolino to witness the execution (hanging).
About a week later, during the night from 8 to 9 September 1944, another German soldier was wounded when a mine exploded near the village of San Tomè. The day after the incidence, Nordhorn’s soldiers, together with Italian collaborators, conducted a razzia in the village of San Tomè and arbitrarily arrested six men. Once again, the villagers were forced to witness how Nordhorn’s troops hanged the six people. In both cases, the executions were meant to discourage villagers to collaborate with partisans.
After the war had finished, Nordhorn settled in Germany and ran a construction company in Greven before he retired.
On 3 November 2006 a military tribunal in La Spezia (Italy) took on the case of Heinrich Nordhorn.
