Ranko Momić was born on 13 June 1967 in Doboj, in Bosnia and Herzegovina. He is Serbian with Bosnian citizenship. He is married and has five children.
Momić was a member of Yugoslav People’s Army in 1991 when the conflict in Slovenia started. A year later, he became a member of the army of Republika Srpska. In 1992 he was transferred to the police of Republika Srpska. Later on, he joined a paramilitary unit called the “Tigers”, led by Željko Ražnatović Arkan until 1996, when Serbian forces withdrew from Croatia.
Momić himself stated that he decided to go to fight in Kosovo in 1998, after being called by one of the members of Arkan’s unit.
After coming to Kosovo, Momić joined the Special Police Unit, which was part of the Ministry of Interior Affairs of Serbia.
The international armed conflict in Kosovo started on 24 March 1999 with NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, and lasted until 20 June 1999.
As a result of the NATO bombing, Momić voluntarily applied to the 177th squad in Peć on 24 March 1999. He was received by Toplica Miladinović, and after the first meeting, he met Nebojša Minić, who was appointed by Miladinović to lead the unit, and Momić thus became a member of the “Jackals”.
The “Jackal” fighters were first considered paramilitaries, but they were all members of the Yugoslav army, with military identification, and they all received salaries from the army.
It was alleged that “Jackals” were ethnically cleaning the area around Peć, attacking numerous villages (Ljubetić, Pavlan, Zahač, Ćuška), committing war crimes against mostly Albanian civilian population.
Momić was suspected to be one of the crucial actors and a perpetrator of numerous crimes in the attack on Ćuška.
Momić was arrested in Montenegro in January 2011, upon the order of the investigative judge of the the War Crimes Chamber of the High Court in Belgrade and extradited to Serbia on 21 April 2011.
