Blaise Adoua was Commander of the Presidential Guard, known as the Republican Guard of Congo Brazzaville, in 1999.
Between 1998-1999, heavy fighting erupted around Brazzaville between the Congolese armed forces and various militias. These confrontations led to the exodus of thousands civilians to the Democratic Republic of Congo.
In the context of this civil war, governments of the two Congos and the High Commissioner for Refugees concluded a tripartite agreement aimed at facilitating the voluntary repatriation of those Congolese forced into exile as a result of the armed violence. Between 5 and 14 May 1999, 6599 refugees coming from Kinshasa crossed the river Congo, towards the Brazzaville harbor, called the Brazzaville Beach.
Upon arrival, refugees were allegedly split up into separate groups: soldiers, women, able bodied-and especially young- men. The latter were reportedly taken out of the line-up, to be led off to premises at the Brazzaville Beach before being subsequently transferred to secret locations from which, thereafter, they simply disappeared.
