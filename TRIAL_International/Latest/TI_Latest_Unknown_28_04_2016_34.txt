facts

Julius Viel was born on 21 February 1918 and grew up in the South of Germany, in the towns of Adelsheim and Kirchheim Unter Teck. At the beginning of the war, he voluntarily joined the waffen SS. In 1945 he was on duty at the Kleine Festung Theresienstadt, a political prison as well as a concentration camp, near Prague, in the current Czech Republic.
After the war, Viel started working as a journalist at the daily newspaper Stuttgarter Zeitung, one of the first German newspapers allowed by the occupying powers in 1945. In addition to his work as a journalist, Viel wrote many hiking guidebooks. It is for both these activities that he received the Federal cross of merit in 1983, awarded for his political involvement and his volunteer activities.
A first investigation has been conducted against Viel in the 1960s, but has been quickly abandoned due to the lack of conclusive evidence. It was only in 1994 that suspicions about his activities during the war have resurfaced. Steven Rambam, an American private investigator famous for having hunted down many former Nazi criminals, is the one having uncovered the crime for which Julius Viel has been sentenced in 2001. During a large-scale operation aimed at hunting down former Nazi officers, Rambam received the testimony of a University Professor in Canada and former subordinate of Viel in Theresienstadt prison, Adalbert Lallier. He acknowledged having taken part in the cold blooded murder of seven Jewish prisoners by Viel, while they were digging an anti-tank trench not far from the prison. Viel allegedly fired automatic weapons on these prisoners without special reasons, killing seven of them.
This testimony has been the main basis of the investigation initiated against Viel. Julius Viel has been sentenced to 12 years in prison by the Ravensburg Court on 3 April 2001.
