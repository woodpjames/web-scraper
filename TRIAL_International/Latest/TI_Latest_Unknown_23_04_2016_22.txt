facts

Mohamed Ali Samantar was born in Somalia in 1931. He finished school in Mogadishu and became a member of the Somali army.
He joined the officer corps of the Somali National Army (SNA) in 1960 and was later promoted to lieutenant colonel and then to general.
He participated in the 1969 military coup triggered by the assassination of Abdirashid Ali Shermake that brought President Siad Barre to power. On 6 august 1971 Barre appointed Samantar the Minister of defence and First Vice President of Somalia. From 1987 to 1990 Samantar held the office of the Prime Minister of Somalia.
In 1981, the north-western part of the country took up arms and formed the Somaliland National Movement (SNM) to resist Barre government. Samantar allegedly oversaw the reprisals led by government troops in May and June of 1988 and allegedly commanded the forces that attacked the civilian population and committed severe crimes like mass killings, forced disappearances, rapes, arbitrary detentions, torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment as well as other crimes against humanity and other war crimes. Approximately 5.000 civilians were killed in the assault.
When Barre was overthrown by warlord Mohammed Farah Aidid and his rebel group, the United Somali Congress (USC) in 1991, Samantar fled to Italy and in 1997 to the United States.
