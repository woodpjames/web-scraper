Facts

Sufyain Barhoumi was born in Alger, Algeria on 28 July 1973. He left Algeria as a migrant worker in 1995 to Europe (Spain, France then England).
Barhoumi was recruited in 1999 at the Cultural Islamic Centre of London to receive military training in Afghanistan and to participate in the Jihad in Chechnya.
Barhoumi travelled to Pakistan with a false French passport under the name of Khalid Stouf. Thereafter, he travelled to Afghanistan where he attended Al-Qaeda sponsored military training at various small camps from March 1999 to February 2000.
After the 11 September 2001 attack in the United States, Barhoumi left Afghanistan for Pakistan. In March 2002, he travelled to Faisalabad, Pakistan where he was captured two weeks later by Pakistan Security forces during a night raid on 28 March 2002.
Barhoumi was afterwards transferred to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba on 18 June 2002. The reasons for his transfer to Guantanamo Bay included among others his acquaintance with Al-Qaida members in the United Kingdom and his alleged knowledge of Al-Qaida leadership and training camps.
Other Guantanamo detainees accused him of being as a trainer in Al Quaida camps. According to the Joint task force Guantanamo, Barhoumi was allegedly specialized in explosive devices. He was classified as the high intelligence value.
