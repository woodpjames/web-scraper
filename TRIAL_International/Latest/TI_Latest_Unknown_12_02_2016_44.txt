In December 2013, TRIAL submitted an individual communication to the United Nations Human Rights Committee (HCR) regarding the multiple human rights violations related to the enforced disappearance, torture and arbitrary detention suffered by Mrs. Sarita Devi Sharma between 20 October 2003 and 30 June 2005. In 2018, the HRC reached its decision on this complaint: Nepal has a responsibility in this case.
