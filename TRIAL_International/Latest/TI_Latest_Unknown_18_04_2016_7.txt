Germain Katanga, alias ”Simba”, was born on 28 April 1978 in the district of Ituri, in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Katanga is alleged to have been the highest ranking leader of the Patriotic Resistance Force in Ituri (FRPI) since the beginning of 2003. On 11 December 2004, he was reportedly promoted to the rank of General in the Army of the DRC.
Between January 2002 and December 2003, over 8’000 civilians died and more than half a million persons were displaced from their homes in Ituri as a consequence of the armed conflict between the FRPI and other armed militias in the region of Ituri. Between January 2003 and at least March 2003, the FRPI and the Nationalist and Integrationist Front (FNI) were reported to have conducted attacks – in a systematic or widespread manner – against the civilian population in various parts of Ituri.
As the highest ranking commander of the FRPI, Katanga was said to have played an essential role in the planning and the implementation of an indiscriminate attack against the village of Bogoro in Ituri, on or around 24 February 2003, together with other commanders of the FNI. He was also believed to have ordered his subalterns to launch this attack.
On the morning of 24 February 2003, members of Katanga’s militia allegedly entered the village of Bogoro and launched an indiscriminate attack, targeting mainly civilian members of the Hema ethnic group. It was alleged that the FRPI had children under the age of fifteen participate in the attack during which at least 200 civilians were killed. Those who survived the initial attack were locked up in a building where the bodies of the dead persons had been piled up. Furthermore, women and young girls were abducted to be turned into sexual slaves. Finally, the FRPI ended up totally pillaging the village of Bogoro, thus wiping it off the map.
