During the conflict which opposed the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina against the Croatian Defense Council in the territory of the Konjic municipality, Bukvic is reported to have committed war crimes against civilians.
It is alleged that on 25 April 1993, in the village of Celebici, in the municipality of Konjic, that members of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina took prisoner, Croatian civilians together with members of the Croatian Defense Council, who had already surrendered beforehand with their arms.
These prisoners were then reportedly lined up in the Celebici primary school playground where they were said to have been subjected to both physical and mental abuse. Several members of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina as well as civilians present at the scene were then reported to have shouted out “Kill him Safet. He killed your brother in law”
A group of soldiers then allegedly separated the victim, a Croatian civilian, from the others and began to give him a beating using their fists, feet and rifle butts. They then reportedly took him to a cellar where they were joined by Safet Bukvic who was armed with a gun and was accompanied by a non-identified soldier. The latter allegedly shot him in the chest. As the victim lay in agony, Bukvic is said to have gone over to him and fired a second shot to his chest to finish him off.
The State Court of Bosnia-Herzegovina confirmed the Bill of Indictment against Safet Bukvic on 14 May 2009.
