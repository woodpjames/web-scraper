Rrustem Mustafa, also known as Commander Remi, was born in 1971 in Kosovo. During the Kosovo war from 1998 until 1999 he was the Commander of the Lab region zone and a member of the so-called “Lapska group” of the KLA.
Under his command, Serb and Albanian civilians were allegedly murdered and had their property looted and destroyed. Others were kidnapped and illegally detained in prisons located in the villages of Bradaš and Gornja Lapaštica. There, Rrustem and others allegedly kept detainees in inhumane conditions, denying them adequate sanitation, food, water and medical care and subjecting them to routine beatings, torture and death threats between August 1998 and June 1999.
In April 1999, Rrustem allegedly ordered Nazif Mehmeti to kill five Kosovo Albanians detained in the Majac and Potok detention centres and accused of collaboration with the Serb forces.
After the conflict, Rrustem became a parliamentary deputy and the vice president of the governing Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK).
