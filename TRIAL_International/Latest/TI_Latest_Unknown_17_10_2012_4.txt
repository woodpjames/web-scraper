facts

Juan Daniel Amelong was born on 11 January 1952 in Rosario and belongs to a family with lots of brothers, some of them becoming physicians or priests. He starts a career in real estate and goes to university where he obtains a diploma as a lawyer at the Universidad Nacional del Litoral in the city of Santa Fe.
Then he enters the army where he will eventually become a lieutenant.
During the dictatorship, he is head of operations in Intelligence Regiment 121 of the city of Rosario where more than 500 people disappeared. He allows his own house of La Ribera to be used as a clandestine detention and torture centre known under the name of La Intermedia. He also tortures political prisoners in centres like La Calamita in Granadero Baigorria, la Quinta de Funes and la Fábrica Militar de Armas Portátiles Domingo Matheu, situated at number 5200, Ovidio Lagos Street in Rosario.
After the dictatorship, he is arrested and accused of torturing and disappearing people but, on 27 July 1987, the Rosario Federal Chamber frees him thanks to the Due Obedience Law. When that law is declared unconstitutional, Amelong presents himself spontaneously to the authorities and is detained in the Second Army Corps HQ.
In June 2004, he is accused of kidnapping, torturing and disappearing 14 political militants by the federal judge Omar Digerónimo, who brings him to trial before the Oral Federal Tribunal n°1 of Rosario, in the so-called Guerrieri-Amelong Cause, together with Pascual Oscar Guerrieri, Jorge Alberto Fariña, Walter Salvador Dionisio Pagano, Juan Antonio Zaccaría and Marino Héctor González, all members of the Regiment 121.
