facts

Sabit Geci was born on 20 August 1958 in the village of Lauša, Municipality of Srbica.
In 1993, he joined the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) and was in charge of the procurement of arms and the training of self-proclaimed KLA members in the region of Drenica. Later Geci became one of the local commanders of KLA in Northeastern Albania and Kosovo.
In his role as a commander of the KLA, he allegedly mistreated and tortured ethnic Albanian prisoners at a detention facility in the town of Kukes in Northeastern Albania during 1999. The Kukes detention facility was a key supply point for the KLA during the conflict in the 1990s. Some of the 40 people who were mistreated in Kukes were detained by the KLA in Durres. Geci also allegedly abducted Kosovo Serbs into northern Albania in concentration camp Daphne in Drenica, where he allegedly participated in the executions and torture of non-Albanian population, removed their organs and sold them on the black market.
He was arrested for the first time in October 2000 by UNMIK forces following a shooting incident at one of Pristina’s nightclubs. This arrest was related to his involvement in organized crime networks and extortion under the pretence of financing the KLA activities. Geci was tried in April 2001, and sentenced to 5 years and 6 months in jail by the UNMIK Tribunal for endangering security and damaging the property of others through extortion. In January 2002 the he court panel chaired by the International Judge Vagn Joensen upheld the sentence handed down to Sabit Geci, thus denying the appeal lodged by Geci’s lawyer.
In 2002 the EULEX began an investigation into Geci for mistreatment of persons held in KLA facilities in northern Albania during the conflict in 1998-1999.
