facts

Ely Ould Dah is a Mauritanian national who was born in 1962.The charges against him are to be seen in the context of an ethnic purge and a vast campaign of repression led by the Mauritanian government in power at the time.
In 1990 under the pretext of a hypothetical conspiracy, several thousands of African Mauritanians were arrested and tortured. In May 1993, an amnesty law prohibited any legal proceedings to be taken against those responsible for these acts.
Captain Ely Ould Dah was, at the time, intelligence officer at the Jreida prison base, close to Nouakchott. He was reported to have been responsible for having ordered the torture of two black Mauritanian soldiers, Mamadou Diagana and Ousmane Dia and to have participated in these acts.
His arrest in France on 2 July 1999, when he was participating in a training programme in Montpellier sparked of a serious diplomatic crisis with Mauritania, of which France is the principal commercial partner and the principal provider of public development aid.
