facts

Zemir Kovacevic was born on 8 August 1966 in Slavonski Brod, Croatia. He was a fighter with the Inventions Squad of the First Bosanski Brod Brigade of the Croatian Defence Forces (HVO), later also known as the 101st Bosanski Brod Brigade. As the official military representation of the unrecognized Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia, which existed in Bosnia and Herzegovina during the Bosnian War between 1991 and 1994, the HVO was the main military force of the Croats of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Kovacevic is alleged to have participated in crimes that occurred during the Sijekovac massacre, where around 47 Serb civilians were killed during the months of March and April 1992 in the village of Sijekovac located near Bosanski Brod in Bosnia and Herzegovina, next to the Croatian border. Even though members of Croat and Bosniak army units are believed to have carried out the attack on the civilians, the exact course of the incident is still unknown and only individual cases have been tried.
During these events, on 26 March 1992, Kovacevic is alleged to have killed two persons in Sijekovac. After this, he is alleged to have treated other civilians who had been taken from their homes after an attack on the village in an inhumane manner by holding a pistol to their foreheads, as well as having escorted civilians to locations where they later performed forced labour during the months of July and August 1992
Kovacevic is also alleged to have participated in the pillaging of Serbian houses in April 1992. One victim whom Kovacevic allegedly killed was said by his mother to be mentally disabled.
For these acts, on 29 October 2011, Kovacevic was ordered into custody and charged with war crimes against civilians pursuant to Article 173(1)(a)(c)(e)(f) in conjunction with Article 180(1) of the Criminal Code of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Individual Criminal Responsibility) by the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
