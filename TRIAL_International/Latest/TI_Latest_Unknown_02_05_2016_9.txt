Osami Nagano was born on 15 June 1880 in Kochi into a Samurai family. He was a graduate of the Imperial Naval Academy and served on several Japanese Navy ships. In 1913, he went to the United States where he studied law at Harvard University.
From 1920 to 1923, he was Naval Attach√© to the Japanese Embassy in Washington, in which capacity he attended the Washington Naval Conference. Nagano put the finishing touch to his naval career by becoming Fleet Admiral, which led to his holding important naval functions including representing his country at the 1931 Geneva Disarmament Conference.
In 1935, during the negotiations which were aimed at concluding the London Treaty on Naval Disarmament, he refused to accept the conditions of the Treaty which denied Japan naval parity with the United States and Great Britain. On 9 March 1936, he became Navy Minister. On 2 February 1937, he was appointed Commander in Chief of the Combined Fleet. Finally, on 9 April 1941, Nagano became Chief of the Naval General Staff.
When war broke out, Nagano was put in charge of coordinating and organising the movements and attacks of the Japanese Navy, in particular the attack against Pearl Harbour.
On 21 February 1944, he resigned from all of his positions following several setbacks and defeats encountered by the Japanese Fleet.
He was arrested by the Allied Forces after the end of the war and brought before the International Military Tribunal for the Far East.
