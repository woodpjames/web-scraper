The General Context 
It is estimated that between 100,000 and 200,000 people died as a consequence of the conflict (1992-1995) in BH and that between 25,000 and 30,000 were victims of enforced disappearance. Around 10,000 people remain missing to date.
The massacre and the subsequent removal and concealment of the mortal remains of Zikreta Bacic, Sabahudin Bacic, Zikret Bacic and Šida Bacic occurred as a part of the ethnic cleansing operations perpetrated by the Serb army in the context of the military attack of Prijedor and the surrounding area.
