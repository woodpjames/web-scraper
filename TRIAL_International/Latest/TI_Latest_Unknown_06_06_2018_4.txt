Facts

Ali Mamluk was born in Damascus on 19 February 1946. He is one of the founders of the Syrian Air Force Intelligence Service. After having served as the head of the General Security Directorate, President Bashar al-Assad appointed him in June 2005 as head of the National Security Bureau. Since 9 May 2011, Mamluk has been subjected to sanctions by the European Union and the United States for his role in the repression of the Syrian population.
On 22 February 2012, while covering the siege of the city of Homs, war correspondent Marie Colvin lost her life in an attack conducted by the forces of the Syrian government on the building where she was together with other journalists. Mamluk is accused of being one of the Syrian officials behind this attack.
 Additionally, on 17 February 2013, Abdulmuemen Alhaj Hamdo, a Syrian national born in Idleb, disappeared while delivering goods between the municipality Mashta el Helou and the city of Homs, in the west of Syria. In 2015, the oldest son of Abdulmuemen Alhaj Hando recognised his father’s corpse on multiple photographs taken by a forensic photographer going by the name of Caesar, a deserter from the Syrian army. Caesar published more than 50’000 photographs exhibiting the multitude of crimes committed in detention centres of the Syrian government since 2013.
Mamluk is also accused of assassinating Wissam Al-Hassan, the head of the Information Branch of the Lebanese Internal Security Forces, who died in a car bombing in 2012.
More generally, war crimes and crimes against humanity were allegedly committed in detention centres controlled by the Syrian intelligence services, in particular in Security Branches 215, 235, and 227. High-ranking individuals, including Mamluk, are suspected of being responsible as superiors, indirect perpetrators, or accomplices in conducting illegal arrests, detentions, torture, sexual violence, and other inhumane acts in the detention centres of these branches between May 2011 and July 2015.
