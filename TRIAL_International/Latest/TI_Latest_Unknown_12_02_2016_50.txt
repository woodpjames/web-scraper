Enforced disappearance of Sahraoui AYACHE in August 1994
12.02.2016
General Context 
The enforced or involuntary disappearances, of which M. Sahraoui Ayache is one of the countless victims, had its roots in the Algerian Civil War. After the end of a bloody war of national liberation, Algeria, then proud of its new found independence, nevertheless shortly afterwards descended into a fratricidal conflict which led to brutal excesses and massive violations of human rights.
According to different information sources between 7,000 to 20,000 persons were arrested or abducted by all corps of Algerian security services and the militia armed by the government between 1992 and 1998, and are still missing.
To date, the families of the victims of enforced or involuntary disappearances have received no information whatsoever concerning the fate of their disappeared relatives. The Algerian authorities have never seen fit to open up enquiries as a result of complaints or enquiries addressed to them. Although the identity of the authors and instigators of these crimes is known, none of them has ever been prosecuted or troubled. Furthermore, since the adoption of the Charter for Peace and National Reconciliation in 2006, the latter benefit from a thinly disguised amnesty since it is no longer allowed to bring a complaint for exactions similar to those endured by M. Sahraoui Ayache Algeria seeing these as being attempts to “exploit the wounds of the national tragedy”, and an attempt to retard the process of national reconciliation underway.
