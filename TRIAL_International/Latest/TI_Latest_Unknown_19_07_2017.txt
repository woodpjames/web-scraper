Next challenge for universal jurisdiction: overcoming double standards

Andreas Schüller, head of ECCHR’s International Crimes and Accountability Program, is optimistic that universal jurisdiction is moving forward and helping to shed light on persisting areas of impunity.
2016 has seen the sentencing of former dictator Hissène Habré in Senegal – a major victory for universal jurisdiction. The case has shown that justice is possible and gave victims hope. Senegal also played an immensely important role for justice in Africa by prosecuting Hissène Habré in line with international standards.
More and more countries are developing the necessary infrastructure, such as war crimes units, to prosecute international crimes cases. Civil society submissions to prosecutors, and the global outcry against atrocities, notably in Syria, have also contributed to the rising number of cases.
But there remain huge discrepancies among European States and globally, both in terms of legislation and prosecuting organs. A good model is Germany. It is equipped with an experienced – though insufficiently funded – war crimes unit, along with legislation providing for “pure” universal jurisdiction, making it possible to undertake investigations even against suspects residing outside of the country.
