Frederic Batumike and others - Kavumu Trial
12.02.2018
Facts

Kavumu is a very poor village in the South Kivu province in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). For many years, this region has been the scene of violence, fighting for territories and natural resources, and power struggle.
Between 2013 and 2016, more than 40 young girls in Kavumu, aged between 13 months and 12 years, were kidnapped and raped during the night.
The same process was observed in all cases: after being kidnapped by one or several men, the victim was raped, after which her hymenal blood was taken, sometime with the help of a sharp object, before being abandoned.
Initially, the attacks were considered and treated by the local judicial authorities as isolated cases.
