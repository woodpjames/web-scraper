facts

Miguel Etchecolatz was born in 1929. During the first years of the military dictatorship in Argentina, he was Commissioner General of Police in Buenos Aires and the right-hand man of Police Chief Ramón Camps. From March 1976 until late 1977, he served as Director of Investigations of the provincial police. During this period, more illegal arrests were carried out in Buenos Aires than in any other province.
According to official sources, 13’000 people were killed or disappeared during the military dictatorship’s “Dirty War” between 1976 and 1983. Human rights organisations estimate that the number is closer to 30’000.
Apart from many other cases of enforced disappearance and murder, Etchecolatz was said to be responsible for the “Night of the Pencils”, an operation in the course of which several students were detained, tortured and killed. He was also said to have operated, together with Camps, at least eight clandestine detention centres in La Plata, Quilmes, Banfield and Martínez.
Miguel Etchecolatz is the author of a book in which he defends the Argentinean military dictatorship.
In 1986, Etchecolatz was sentenced to 23 years in prison for illegal detention and enforced disappearances of hundreds of political prisoners.
