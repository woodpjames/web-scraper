Tunisia: lawyers at the forefront of the fight against torture
26.11.2012
Tunis, 26 November 2012
ACAT-France and TRIAL have just organized a training in Tunis for 25 Tunisian lawyers, lasting from 22 to 24 November. The training was aimed at supporting local lawyers handling torture cases, by helping them to resort more efficiently to international law and mechanisms.
Both organisations are committed to continue working with Tunisian lawyers in their struggle against impunity for perpetrators of acts of torture. The recent revolution has not put an end to this heinous practice and deaths at the hand of security forces are still being reported. It is an imperative that that torturers be brought to justice.
