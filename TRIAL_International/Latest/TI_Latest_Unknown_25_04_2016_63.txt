Maulana Abdus Subhan was born in 1936 in the village of Toilokundi, near the city of Pabna.
Before the Liberation War he acted as chief of the Pabna unit of Jamaat-e-Islami (JI). During the war, he was General Secretary and then Vice-President of the “Peace Committee” in Pabna. The Peace Committee declared the struggle for independence to be a conspiracy hatched by India. He allegedly played a key role in setting up units of Peace Committees as well as paramilitary forces that were used to suppress the Bangladesh movement for independence from Pakistan.
After the war he became a member of the highest policy-making body of JI. He was accused of collaboration with the Pakistani Army during the liberation war and was summoned for trial in 1972. However, he fled to Pakistan before the trial started.
On 20 September 2013 he was arrested and on 31 December 2013 formally charged by the International Crimes Tribunal for war crimes and crimes against humanity committed during the Liberation War.
