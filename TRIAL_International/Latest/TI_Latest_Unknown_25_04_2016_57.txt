facts

Héctor Edisson Castro Corredor was born on 14 November 1970. He was the Chief of the National Police of Colombia.
In early September 1996, in a farm called Fute, which is located in the area Alto de Mondoñedo in Cundimarca department of Colombia, it was alleged that six people were murdered in the event now known as the “Massacre of Mondoñedo”. It is suspected that members of a Directorate of the Colombian National Police (the Directorate of Criminal Investigation and Interpol – Dijin), captured illegally and arbitrarily six young persons from Bogota. They then tortured them, and afterwards extrajudicially executed them. All of the victims were alleged to be members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).
On 7 September 1996, the bodies of four victims were found. They were presumed to have been killed and then burned together with tyres, so that their bodies would not be identified. Two more bodies were found afterward.
The Delegate Prosecutor initiated an investigation into these murders, and linked them to the members of Dijin.
