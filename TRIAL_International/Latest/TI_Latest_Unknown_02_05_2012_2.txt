facts 

Eugène Rwamucyo was born in Ruhengeri, Rwanda in 1959. He is married and his family lives in Anderlues, Belgium. He is a doctor by profession and worked at the university hospital of the National University of Rwanda (Université nationale du Rwanda), in Butare, Rwanda.
The Rwandan People’s Court (Gacaca) concluded during his trial in absentia, that Eugène Rwamucyo was part of a crisis committee that organized and oversaw the genocide in Butare. He is allegedly responsible of the massacre of Tutsis at the Hospital of the Université nationale du Rwanda. He is also accused of participating in meetings with “top genocidaires” in Butare, including a meeting with the Prime Minister of the Hutu interim government in 1994, Jean Kambanda (sentenced to life imprisonment by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda). He is therefore accused of genocide and war crimes.
Until his arrest, Rwamucyo worked at a hospital in Maubeuge, North of France. He was dismissed after a nurse found information on him in the internet.
Rwamucyo was arrested 26 May 2010 by the French Police while attending the funeral of Jean-Bosco Barayagwiza, a fellow Rwandan and convicted genocidaire. His arrest came following an arrest warrant issued in 2006 by the Rwandan Government and publicized by Interpol.
