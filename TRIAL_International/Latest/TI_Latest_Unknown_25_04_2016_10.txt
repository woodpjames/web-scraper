facts

Gojko Eror was born in 1965. He is a Croatian Serb and served as a commander in the Yugoslav National Army (JNA) during the Croatian War of Independence.
The indictment asserts that Eror, along with several other members of the JNA, occupied the village of Berak, near the city of Vukovar, Croatia from 2 September 1991 to the end of 1992. During this period of occupation, Eror allegedly acted as commander of a unit of JNA soldiers and established a Territorial Defense (TO) headquarters in Berak. The indictment claims Eror carried out a violent campaign to eliminate the village’s non-Serb populations through intimidation, torture, murder, and forced relocation to labor camps. Specifically, Eror, along with his subordinate JNA soldiers, has been charged with the disappearances of 17 villagers, as well as for crimes against humanity, torture, kidnapping, and forced detention in a concentration camp.
In April 2006, the County Attorney’s Office in Vukovar released its indictment and officially charged Eror, along with his subordinate JNA officers. The Croatian government subsequently released a warrant for Eror’s arrest, and upon discovering that he had been living in Malta since 2003, sent an extradition request to the Maltese government.
Eror was extradited 3 March 2014, after the Maltese legal system conceded to the validity of the extradition request, although it did not comment on the accuracy of the charges. Following his extradition, Eror was detained at a prison in Osijek, Croatia, throughout the duration of his trial.
