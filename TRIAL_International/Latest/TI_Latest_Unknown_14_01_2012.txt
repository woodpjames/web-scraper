Elvir Javor, Kasim Kusuran, Munib Softic, SÃ©nada Softic and Meho Mujdzic, Bosnian citizens, residing in France, filed a complaint on 20 July 1993 before the examining magistrate of Paris to bring a civil action against a person or persons unknown for war crimes, torture, genocide and crimes against humanity.
In their complaint the plaintiffs denounced the facts of which they were victims in 1992 in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The plaintiffs escaped from Serb detention camps, before being admitted to France between 1992 and 1993. They claimed to be victims of the crimes described below, committed by members of the Serb forces as part of their policy of ethnic cleansing, as it was applied in the town of Kozarac and in the surrounding villages.
The alleged perpetrators of these crimes however, were never to be found in French territory.
