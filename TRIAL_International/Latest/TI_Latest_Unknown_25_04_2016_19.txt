Lazare Kobagaya, a Hutu born in Burundi in 1928 is a former teacher and mill owner living in Wichita Kansas with his family. In 1997 he applied for a visa in Kansas. He obtained US citizenship in 2006.
He has been accused by American authorities of lying to immigration officials when he was asked if he has ever persecuted another person because of their race or social group, and whether he had committed any crime for which he had not been prosecuted. He had declared that he had not committed any crimes during the genocide in Rwanda as he was in Burundi from 1993 to 1995, placing himself outside Rwanda.
According to the indictment, Kobagaya was a wealthy Hutu who lived in Rwanda when the genocide took place. It is alleged that he organized and incited violence against Tutsis on several occasions, including ordering Hutu to burn Tutsi homes, murder hundreds of Hutu who had tried to flee the violence, and kill Tutsi women who had married Hutu men.
In 2009 he has been accused of participating in the Rwanda genocide before a court in Wichita, Kansas and lying to U.S. immigration authorities, on his role in the 1994 killings to secure US citizenship. The case was heard in a Kansas federal courtroom because Kobagaya moved there in 2005 to join family members.
