facts

Abuzaid Dorda was born on 4 April 1944 in Rhebat, Libya.
Dorda entered politics as Governor of the Misrata Province in 1970 until 1972. From 1972 until 1974, he served as Minister of Information and Culture, and from 1974 until 1976 as Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs. In 1990, he became Prime Minister, and in 1997 he became Libya’s Permanent Representative at the UN until 2003. On April 12, 2009, Dorda had been appointed to head the Libyan intelligence service, replacing Moussa Koussa.
Due to his loyalty to the Gaddafi regime, he is considered to be implicated in the crimes against humanity and war crimes committed during the repression of the civil protests and the non-international armed conflict that followed between 15 February and 30 March 2011.
On 15 February 2011, a series of protests and confrontations started in Libya that led to a large popular uprising. Within a week, it spread across the country, including its capital Tripoli. Gaddafi’s Regime responded with a military crackdown on protestors and civilians, recruiting foreign mercenaries to supplement his forces as the Eastern part of the country was falling under control of the rebel forces and parts of the military defected.
By the end of February 2011 the rebels formed a government called the National Transitional Council (NTC) based in Benghazi. According to the information of human rights groups, Gaddafi’s forces are responsible for alleged killings in Tripoli, where 228 or more people died in air strikes; in Benghazi where bombing also allegedly killed some 257 people; and in the towns of Misrata, Brega, Derna, Zenten and Ajdabiya where air strikes and attacks by security forces were allegedly responsible for at least 40 deaths.
On 31 March 2011, Dorda was reported to have been in Tunisia, awaiting flight out of the country.
The U.N. Security Council, in a unanimous decision on 26 February 2011, instructed the International Criminal Court to investigate into the Libyan crisis that was described as “widespread and systematic attacks currently taking place against the civilian population [which] may amount to crimes against humanity”. The United Nations Security Council also passed a resolution freezing the assets of Gaddafi and ten members of his inner circle and restricting their travel.
ICC Prosecutor Jose Luis Moreno Ocampo announced within a week that he had launched an investigation and had identified several suspects. He announced a probe into Gaddafi, three of his sons and key aides, including Dorda, for crimes against humanity arising from the crackdown on Libya’s popular revolt. He has also declared that he has enough proof that crimes against humanity have occurred in Libya.
On 11 September 2011, Dorda was arrested by forces of the NTC.
