TRIAL files torture reparations case before European Court of Human Rights
29.11.2007
On 22 Mai 2007 the Swiss Federal Supreme Court refused to acknowledge the right of an accepted refugee, who lives in Switzerland, to demand reparation from his torturer for the ill-treatment he had suffered in Tunisia. For TRIAL (Track Impunity Always), who had supported the legal action of the victim since its beginning, this decision of the Federal Supreme Court constitutes a regrettable denial of justice.
TRIAL has just submitted the case before the European Court of Human Rights.
