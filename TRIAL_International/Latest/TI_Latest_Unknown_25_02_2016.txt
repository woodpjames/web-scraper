facts


Aleksandar Cvetkovic was a fighter in the 10th Reconnaisance Squad of the Republika Srpska Army (VRS) during the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
He is accused of having been directly involved in the mass execution of more than 900 Bosniak civilians at Branjevo Farm near Srebrenica on 16 July 1995. According to the indictment and witness testimony, he was a member of the eight person firing squad that is alleged to have summarily executed at least 900 civilian Bosniak men and boys. Specifically, he is alleged to have recommended that the squad begin using automatic rifles in order to expedite the process of killing. According to witnesses, the use of automatic rifles was discontinued when it was discovered that they severely injured the prisoners instead of killing them.
Additionally, Cvetkovic is alleged to have participated in an attack in late June 1995 on the UN Safe Area of Srebrenica and the United Nations Protective Force (UNPROFOR) base there. The attack drove many Bosniaks to Branjevo Farm where they were later executed. He is also alleged to have participated in the 11 July 1995 attack in the town of Srebrenica that was codenamed Operation Krivaja 1995. This attack forced Dutch peacekeepers stationed there to flee and allowed for the transfer of Bosniaks in the town to Branjevo Farm.
After the war, Cvetkovic married a Jewish woman and moved to Israel in 2006. He was granted Israeli citizenship on the basis of his wifeâ€™s Judaism. The government of Bosnia and Herzegovina submitted a request for his extradition to the Israeli government on 29 August 2010. The request for extradition was approved by the Israeli Supreme Court in November 2012 and Cvetkovic was extradited to a prison in Sarajevo on 15 August 2013.
The indictment charging Aleksandar Cvetkovic with the criminal offence of genocide related to events in Srebrenica in 1995 was confirmed on 12 September 2013 and the trial began on 12 November 2013.
