Damjanovic allegedly committed several crimes against the Muslim population of the district of Vogosca, in the Sarajevo municipality, between July 1992 and January 1993:
– It is reported that from August 1992 to January 1993 Damjanovic repeatedly beat and physically abused the prisoners of the Planjina Kuca camp with the help of the guards.
– In July 1992, after around twenty prisoners detained at the Bunker camp in Vogosca were taken to the Reljevo site for forced labour, Damjanovic allegedly separated five persons from the group, brought them to the frontline and executed them.
– On the same time, he reportedly captured two civilians in an apartment. The two victims were led away to an unknown location and have never been seen since.
– On 30 August 1992, the accused is said to have persecuted a prisoner in the Planjina Kuca camp. He first insulted him, then engraved a cross on his forehead with a knife.
– At the beginning of September 1992, Dragan Damjanovic, together with two accomplices, allegedly broke into the house of a married couple and after beating and robbing them, he raped the woman.
– Furthermore, in January 1993, Damjanovic reportedly selected several prisoners from Planjina Kuca camp to perform forced labour. A prisoner who had already been severely beaten was forced by Damjanovic to lie in the snow and to have engraved a cross on his forehead using a bayonet. While transferring the prisoners to another location, the victim was separated from the others and executed.
