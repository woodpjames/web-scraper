facts

Saša Baričanin was born on 19 March 1969 in Sarajevo and is a citizen of Bosnia and Herzegovina. He has been accused of, as a former member of a Bosnian Serb Paramilitary unit, taking an active role in the conflict in Former Yugoslavia from 1991 to 1995 against the Bosniaks by forcibly detaining non-Serb civilians and committing murder and rape in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina.
On 13 July 1992, Baričanin, with Veselin Vlahović (also known as ‘Batko’), went to an apartment in the Sarajevo settlement Grbavica and forcibly detained the three members of the non-Serb Balvanović family by taking them away by force and subsequently killing them in an unknown location. Later exhumations of the bodies have indicated that they were murdered using firearms.
Baričanin was also tried for the forced detention of a woman whom he had imprisoned and repeatedly raped for several days. He also allowed for her to be raped by another individual. The victim eventually managed to escape.
Baričanin was furthermore accused of several other crimes including looting, abuse and intimidation of civilians during the conflict.
On 22 February 2011 Baričanin was charged with having committed murder, rape by force or by threat of immediate attack upon life or limb, inhumane treatment with intent to cause serious bodily or mental harm, enslavement and plundering of property, thus committing Crimes against Humanity under Article 172 of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Criminal Code.
