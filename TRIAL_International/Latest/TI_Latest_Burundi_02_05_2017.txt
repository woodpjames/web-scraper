Citing numerous cases of enforced disappearances, TRIAL International calls on the United Nations Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances (WGEID) to go to Burundi.
At the beginning of the month, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein, reported “a major increase in cases of enforced disappearance between November 2016 and March 2017, as well as the discovery of dozens of unidentified bodies in various parts of the country.”
TRIAL International has brought several cases of enforced disappearances in Burundi to the attention of different mechanisms, including the Working Group.
In addition to reviewing individual complaints, the WGEID has the possibility of conducting country missions. Since 2009, it has repeatedly sought an invitation from Burundi – so far without success*.
