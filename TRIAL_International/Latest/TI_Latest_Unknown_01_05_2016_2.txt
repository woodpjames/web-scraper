facts

Haradin Bala was born on 10 June 1957 in Gornja Koretica (Koroticë E Epërme) in the Municipality of Glogovac (Gllogoc), Kosovo.
In early 1998, after years of increasing violence and tension, armed conflict broke out in Kosovo between Serb Forces and the “Ushtria Çlirimtare e Kosovës” (UCK) known in English under the name of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA).
Just as with Serb civilians, Albanian civilians who were perceived by the KLA as either refusing to cooperate with or as resisting the KLA by non military means, were targeted for intimidation, imprisonment, violence and murder.
The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) indicted Haradin Bala, who, at the time, was a member of the KLA and Commander of the Lapusnik (Llapushnik) camp, for having individually or in concert with other members of the joint criminal enterprise, participated in the joint criminal enterprise in the following ways:
– he personally participated in the detention of Serb civilians and perceived Albanian collaborators at the Lapusnik (Llapushnik) prison camp,
– he personally participated in the interrogation of Serb civilians and perceived Albanian collaborators at the Lapusnik (Llapushnik) prison camp. ,
– he personally participated in the brutal and inhumane treatment, physical and psychological assault, torture, and beatings of Serb civilians and perceived Albanian collaborators imprisoned at the Lapusnik (Llapushnik) prison camp,
– he personally participated in the murder of Serb civilians and perceived Albanian collaborators imprisoned at the Lapusnik (Llapushnik) prison camp and participated in the concealment of these crimes through the burial of their bodies.
– he planned, instigated, ordered and personally participated in the murder of ten Albanian civilians in the Berisa (Berisha) mountains on or about 26 July 1998.
– he participated in efforts to keep the existence of the Lapusnik/Llapushnik prison camp, and events that occurred there, secret by threatening prisoners not to observe or discuss events occurring in the camp.
All of the acts, or failures on the part of the accused to prevent them, were indicative of the existence of a large scale, systematic plan to attack the Serb civilian population and those Albanian civilians who, according to the KLA had either refused to cooperate or had resisted the KLA by non-military means.
The Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), issued an indictment against Haradin Bala on 24 January 2003.
On 17 February 2003, Bala was apprehended by KFOR and transferred the next day to the ICTY.
