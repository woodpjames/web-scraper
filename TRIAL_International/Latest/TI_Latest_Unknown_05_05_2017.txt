A lifelong battle for human rights

An op-ed by Giorgio Malinverni 
Giorgio Malinverni has been President of TRIAL International for the past six years. As his term comes to an end, he looks back on the evolution of the NGO and the situation of human rights in general.
Human rights have been my focus throughout my career. I remember that Switzerland had just ratified the European Convention on Human Rights when I started as a professor at the University of Geneva School of Law. The Convention was a tremendous source of inspiration and I never stopped analysing it and explaining it to my students. My work as a judge on the European Court of Human Rights later exposed me to a new facet of human rights.
Since 2011, I have had the pleasure and the honour of presiding over TRIAL International. I am proud to have contributed to its rise and I remain deeply attached to its fundamental mission, oftentimes carried out in sensitive contexts. Today, TRIAL is equipped with a strong structure and a great team that will enable it to meet the challenges of the future.
