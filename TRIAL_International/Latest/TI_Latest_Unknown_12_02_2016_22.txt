Enforced disappearances of Sejad Hero and Ramiz Kožljak in July 1992
12.02.2016
The General Context 
It is estimated that between 100,000 and 200,000 persons died as a consequence of the conflict (1992-1995) in BiH and that between 25,000 and 30,000 were victims of enforced disappearance. Approximately 10,000 people remain disappeared to date.
The cases of Sejad Hero and Ramiz Kožljak occurred in the context of a first wave of enforced disappearances and “ethnic cleansing” operations perpetrated by the Serb army in the spring and summer of 1992.
Notwithstanding the existence of strong evidences on the identity of those responsible for the enforced disappearance and alleged arbitrary execution and the subsequent concealment of the mortal remains of Sejad Hero and Ramiz Kožljak, to date no one has been convicted, prosecuted and sanctioned for the mentioned crimes, thus fostering an overall climate of impunity. Up to this day, the families of men disappeared and arbitrarily executed in Tihovići have not received any information on the fate and whereabouts of their loved ones and have not had the possibility to mourn and bury their relatives in accordance with their religious customs and beliefs
