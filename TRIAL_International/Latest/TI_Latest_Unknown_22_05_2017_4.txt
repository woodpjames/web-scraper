Facts

German Ruiz Figueroa is a former Peruvian military. After the 1968 coup that deposed President Belaúnde and established the Revolutionary Government of the Armed Forces, he became Commander of the Peruvian Army and Head of the Military Intelligence Service (DINTE).
In the context of Operation Condor, in June 1980 Ruiz Figueroa was allegedly involved in the capture and expulsion of four Argentinians, accused of being high ranking members of the Montoneros, a leftist urban guerrilla group. The four victims, some of them with Italian nationality, were soon after expelled to Argentina through Bolivia. This operation was led with the collaboration of the Peruvian Prime Minister Pedro Richter Prada and the support of the military intelligence service, under the command of German Ruiz Figueroa.
Covered reports discovered in 1992 among the so-called Operation Condor’s “Archives of Terror” documented the infliction of torture, disappearance and killings on political opponents extradited to Argentina under the regime of Jorge Videla.
