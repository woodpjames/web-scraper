Óscar Humberto Mejía Victores was born in 1930 and is a military man by profession. Until 1983 he was Deputy Minister of Defense under Efrain Rios Montt, who had gained power by a coup d’État and whom he removed from power in 1983 by another coup in order to become president himself.
Mejía is accused to have committed genocide, as well as torture and crimes against humanity during the Guatemala civil war. At the time, the country was facing an internal armed conflict that lasted 36 years and ended with the Peace Agreements signed on 29 December 1996, which, according to the Truth Commission, left more than 200’000 victims dead or missing. The Commission attributes to the security forces 626 massacres against indigenous communities.
On 31 January 1980, Mejía allegedly attacked the Spanish embassy, where 36 peasant representatives of the CUC trade union (Comité de Unidad Campesina) had taken refuge. The embassy was burnt, provoking the death of 35 peasants and three Spanish members of the embassy. He allegedly organized many other enforced disappearances, tortures and murders of members of Mayan ethnicity, political opponents and trade unionists. He allegedly ordered the execution of massacres in the Ixil Triangle and in Plan de Sanchez, Baja Verapaz, recorded during 1982 and 1984.
He gave up his office as president in 1986 to the winner of the presidential elections Marco Vinicio Cerezo Arévalo.
In December 1999, Nobel peace prized Rigoberto Menchú brought suit against Mejía in the National Court of Spain for genocide, torture and state terror during the Guatemala civil war.
