Facts

Esteelmer Francisco Reyes Girón is a retired Lieutenant Colonel of the Guatemalan Army. During the 1980s – in the midst of Guatemala’s 36-year civil war – Girón was the commander in charge of the military detachment based in the village of Sepur Zarco, located in the Department of Izabal in eastern Guatemala.
The Sepur Zarco military base was set up in late 1981, during the presidency of Efraín Ríos Montt, when local landowners complained about Mayan ethnic Q’eqchi’ group peasant leaders trying to acquire legal titles to the land on which they lived and worked.  During a military operation in Sepur Zarco, at least 15 Q’eqchi’ men were killed or disappeared.
Shortly thereafter, in 1982, at least 15 Q’eqchi’ women – wives of the deceased and disappeared men – were subjected to prolonged violence at the Sepur Zarco base. The women were required to report to the base every two or three days for their ‘shifts’, during which they were forced to cook, clean and were repeated raped. Whilst the ‘shift’ system ended after about ten months, 11 of the women continued to be exploited and subjected to violence until the Sepur Zarco military base was closed in 1988.  The children of some of the 4 women involved who tried to escape into the mountains with their families, died from hunger and exposure.
