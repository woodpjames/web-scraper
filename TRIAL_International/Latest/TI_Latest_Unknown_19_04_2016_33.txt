Hiroshi Oshima was born on 19 April 1886 in Japan. His father Kenichi Oshima was Minister of War from 1916 to 1918.
Oshima became in 1934 a Japanese Military Attaché in Berlin, with the rank of colonel. He was soon befriended by Joachim von Ribbentrop, Hitler’s foreign policy advisor and then Minister of Foreign Affairs. In 1940, he was appointed Ambassador in Berlin, where he remained until the Surrender of Japan.
Oshima, allegedly exerted his full efforts to advance the plans of the Japanese military and, dealing directly with Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, fostered a political and military alliance to align Japan with Germany and Italy against the Western Powers, thus opening the way for the conclusion of the Tripartite Pact in 1940. He also played a crucial role in the Japanese resolution to wage war on the British Empire and the United States in the Pacific.
