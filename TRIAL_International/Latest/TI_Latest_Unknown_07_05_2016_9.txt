facts

Emilio Bungur was born on 10 February 1960 in Šibenik, Croatia. Bungur served as a guard of the 72nd Battalion of the Croatian Army Military Police in the Lora Military Investigative Centre in Split, Croatia during the Serb-Croat war between 1991 and 1995.
Bungur and seven other members of the Battalion are charged with detaining a large number of civilians, mostly of Serb ethnicity, in the Lora Military Investigative Centre in Split, in the period from March to September 1992. The civilians were detained on suspicion that they had been involved in enemy activities against the Republic of Croatia.
Bungur and his co-defendants committed the crimes working with still unidentified persons, and with no legal basis for such an act.
The defendants offended the detainees’ human dignity, humiliating them, mistreating them both physically and mentally, and torturing and physically punishing them, which resulted in the deaths of two of the detainees, Gojko Bulović and Nenad Knežević. The court found that Bungur, as guard of intervention platoon of Military Police, had been torturing civilian prisoners by means of electrical shocks, beatings with baseball bats, forcing them into dogs kennels and insisting they sing Croatian Nazi collaborators songs.
Bungur was tried in absentia as he has been fugitive from justice from the beginning of the trial.
