Facts

Luis Alberto Paredes Nájera is an ex-army colonel and was second commander of Military Zone 21 – a former military base in Cobán, Alta Verapaz – between 1 January 1981 and 15 August 1982, during Guatemala’s civil war.
During the 1980s, Military Zone 21 was used by the Guatemalan military as a secret center for illegal detentions, torture, extrajudicial killings, forced disappearance, and rape. In 2012, mass graves containing hundreds of bodies of indigenous men, women, and children from different Mayan ethnic groups – including Achí, Q’eqchi’, Pomochí, Ixil, and Kiché – were uncovered at Military Zone 21, which is now the site of a training center for U.N. peacekeepers known by the Spanish acronym CREOMPAZ. Over 550 skeletons have been exhumed, and at least 128 of the victims have been identified using DNA testing.
Some of these victims have been identified as the victims of the Pambach massacre: on 2 June 1982, the army entered the village of Pambach, about 38 kilometres from Cobán, and forced all the villagers from their homes, separating the men and women. They took all the men away, claiming they had to fulfil their military service, and the men were never seen again. Their bodies were found in the graves at CREOMPAZ in 2012.
On 6 January 2016, Guatemalan authorities arrested 14 former high-ranking military officers in connection with the CREOMPAZ case for crimes committed at Military Zone 21 between 1981 and 1988.
