facts

Yusuf Maulana Abul Khalam Muhammad (alias AKM Yusuf) was born in February 1926 in Rajair, a village in the south west of Bangladesh within the district of Bagerhat. During his younger years, AKM Yusuf undertook studies in Islam and Hadith which resulted in his gaining various distinctions and awards for excellence. He became a professor in 1952 in the same field.
The young AKM Yusuf soon went into politics becoming, in 1952 at 35 years of age, a member of the National Assembly for the districts of Khulna and Barisal in the south of the country. In 1956, he took over the direction of the Khulna branch of the Jamaat-e-Islami party until its dissolution in October 1958 following the introduction of martial law in Pakistan.
In 1962, with the rescinding of martial law, AKM Yusuf was appointed Naib-e-Ameer (Vice-President) of the East Pakistan territory (todayâ€™s Bangladesh) and a member of the Central Executive Council of Jamaat-e-Islami, both of which positions he held until the independence of Bangladesh in 1971. After the independence of Bangladesh, AKM Yusuf held the position of General Secretary of Jamaat-e-Islami, before taking up the interim direction of the party following the arrest- also for war crimes- of Maulana Motiur Rahman Nizami in February 2012.
During the Bangladesh Liberation War, AKM Yusuf was firmly Pakistani, in line with the stated position of his party. He was suspected of having created the first Razakars faction a pro-Pakistani paramilitary group, in Khulna. The Razakars were accused of having committed numerous crimes against Bangladeshi autonomists during the 1971 Liberation War.
After being at first arrested for the murder of separatists during the Liberation War, but then released on bail by the Bangladeshi Supreme Court, AKM Yusuf was subsequently indicted and put under arrest by order of the Bangladesh International Crimes Tribunal on 12 May 2013.
