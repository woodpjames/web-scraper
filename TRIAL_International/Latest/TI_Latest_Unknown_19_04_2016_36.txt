facts

Ivica Rajic was born on 5 May 1958 in Johovac, Bosnia and Herzegovina. He graduated from a military school in the ex-Yugoslavia with the rank of Captain (first class) in the JNA (Yugoslavian National army or Yugoslavian People’s Army). In 1993, the army forces of the Croatian self-proclaimed community Herceg-Bosna, also known as the Croatian Defence Council (HVO), were engaged in an armed conflict with the government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Ivica Rajic was named commander of the second operational group of the HVO in August 1992. During October 1993, the city of Vares in central Bosnia was under HVO’s control. On 23 October 1993, Ivica Rajic commanded an attack on Stupni Do, near the town of Vares, which was inhabited by 250 residents, most of whom were Muslims. The attack resulted in the death of at least 16 civilians. The village was destroyed almost in its entirety and the few survivors were forced to escape.
Ivica Rajic was able to hide during the years in the region of Split thanks to his relations in the army, which allowed him to get false identity papers.
On 5 April 2003, Ivica Rajic was arrested by the Croatian police. He was transferred to the International Criminal Tribunal for ex-Yugoslavia (ICTY) on 24 June 2003 after an extradition request was issued.
