Jose Remigio Rios San Martin was born in Chile. He was member of the special forces, paratrooper, and agent of the Mulchen brigade of the National Intelligence Directorate (DINA). In the year 1976 he served as Sergeant. He is accused of participating in the kidnap and subsequent murder of Carmelo Soria Espinoza, a Spanish citizen who worked for the UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) in Chile, for that reason the judicial authorities in Spain sought to extradite him in order to stand trial in Spain.
On 14 July 1976, in the night, while Soria Espinoza was driving his car to his home in Santiago de Chile, he was intercepted by two members of the DINA, the officer Rios San martin and Lepe Orellana, who transported him to the house of the US citizen Michael Vernon Townley, which functioned as “clandestine center of interrogation and torture”. There Soria was tortured while they interrogated if he had any relationship with the Communist Party of Chile and his political activities in the country. After torturing Soria, the DINA’s agents assassinated him, injected alcohol to his body and threw his body and his vehicle to a stream simulating an automobile accident.
The killing of Soria took place within the process of systematic repression of opponents of the military regime promoted by the Chilean dictatorship.
In 1979 the case was dismissed. In 1993 the Third Criminal Court of Santiago de Chile revived the criminal proceedings for the crimes against the Chilean-Spanish national, in the cases exists the confession of Sergeant San Martin Rios, to police investigators about his involvement in torture and subsequent assassination of Soria.
