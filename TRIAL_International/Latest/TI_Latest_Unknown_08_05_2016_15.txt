This paramilitary formation operated in the municipality of Teslić in June 1992. During that month, Marjanovic, along with five other members of the group allegedly unlawfully detained Bosnian Muslims and Croats and subjected them to daily physical and psychological abuse. Reportedly, they also took 28 prisoners from the municipality of Teslić and transferred them to Mount Broje on 17 June 1992, where they shot them. Then, according to witnesses, the killed civilians were dumped into a mass grave.
In September 2014, several members of the paramilitary group suspected of having committed crimes against humanity, Marjanovic included, were arrested by the Bosnian State Investigation and Protection Agency.
