Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri was born on 5 January 1965 in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. He participated in the war in Afghanistan against the Russians and in the Tajik insurgency. Trained in explosives, al-Nashiri was allegedly Al Qaedaâ€™s operations chief in the Arabian Peninsula, where he led cells in Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Yemen.
According to the US authorities, al-Nashiri returned to Afghanistan around 1997, joined the Taliban forces and fought against the Afghan Northern Alliance. During this time, al-Nashiri allegedly developed a network that smuggled weapons into Saudi Arabia and that supplied forged documents to terrorists. His network is also suspected of being involved in the US embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania in July 1998.
It is believed that al-Nashiri joined Al Qaeda in 1998 and reported directly to Osama Bin Laden. In late 1998, al-Nashiri allegedly suggested attacking a US vessel off the coast of Yemen. The first attempt to blow up a US warship, the USS The Sullivans, failed. Ten months later on 12 October 2000, USS Cole, a guided missile destroyer, was bombed off the coast of Yemen killing 17 sailors and injuring 39 others. According to US officials, al-Nashiri was the mastermind behind the bombing.
After the attack on USS Cole, al-Nashiri allegedly became the operations chief of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. He is accused of arranging a third boat attack in Yemen on the French tanker, the Limburg, on 6 October 2002, which resulted in the death of one crew member and the spillage of approximately 90,000 barrels of oil into the Gulf of Aden.
