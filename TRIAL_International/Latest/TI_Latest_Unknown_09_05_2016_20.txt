facts


Zdenko Jakisa was born in 1969 in Bosnia. He lives with his wife, Anna Jakisa, in Forest Lake, Minnesota, in the United States of America. In the 1990s, during the Croatian war of independence, Jakisa was a member of the Croatian Defence Council (HVO).
In 1998, Zdenko and Anna Jakisa requested refugee status and entry to the United States of America from the American embassy in Croatia. The lottery system approved their requests and they were sponsored by the “Catholic Charities” organisation and the local church of Forest Lake, Minnesota.
Zdenko Jakisa applied for permanent residency in the United States of America in 2001; this was granted in 2002.
IN BOSNIA HERZEGOVINA
Jakisa served in the Croatian army between 1991 and 1995 during the Croatian War of Independence against the former Yugoslavia, specifically within the Croatian Defence Council (HVO).
A Bosnia Herzegovina court register showed that Jakisa was charged and arrested for various crimes, including: violent and threatening behaviour, robbery, grievous bodily harm and hold-ups.
Additionally, in 1993, Jakisa murdered Nevenka Elezovic, a 62 year old Bosnian-Serb woman, in the town of Capljina, Bosnia Herzegovina. At this time, Jakisa also kidnapped, stripped and mugged a Muslim Bosnian man who was living with Elezovic.
New documents linked to Jakisa’s case show that two of Capljina’s brothers in Bosnia Herzegovina also accused Jakisa of killing their parents, Ahmet and Emina Basic. Jakisa has not been formally charged with their murders, but the investigation into this is ongoing in Bosnia Herzegovina.
While the investigation into the death of Elezovic was in progress, Jakisa left Bosnia Herzegovina and travelled to Croatia in January 1998 where he and his wife submitted their request for refugee status and entry to the United States of America; their application was successful. They arrived in the United States of America a few months later.
