facts

Edouard Oulman was Capitan of a Russian Special Intelligence Unit.
On 11 January 2002, during a control carried out at a roadblock between Chatoï and Daï, two villages lying between Chechnya and Dagestan, Captain Edourd Oulman, leader of the special unit of the Russian Intelligence Agency (GRU), reportedly told his men to open up fire on a vehicle carrying six people after the driver had refused to stop.
One of the passengers, Saïd Alaskhanov, headmaster of a school in a nearby village, was said to have died instantaneously. Two out of the six passengers in total were injured.
The subordinates to Captain Oulman, Sergeant Vladimir Voïevodine and Lieutenant Alexander Kalaganski, reportedly led the five remaining survivors to a nearby abandoned farm.
Here they dispensed first aid to the injured, still holding them captive, whilst Captain Oulman reported the incident by radio to Major Alexeï Perelevski. According to the prosecution, Major Alexeï Perelevski then forwarded a message from headquarters to Captain Edouard Oulman, instructing him to eliminate the prisoners. Oulman was then subsequently said to have transmitted this order to his subordinates.
It was alleged that Oulman gave the order to his subordinates saying they should tell the civilian that they were now free to go, but then to put them to death as they moved away. His subordinates carried out this command, killing the civilians, putting their bodies into the car which they then set alight. One of them reportedly managed to escape but some time later died of his injuries.
Captain Edouard Oulman, his two subordinates and his commander Alexeï Perelevski, were put on trial for the events which took place on 11 January 2002.
