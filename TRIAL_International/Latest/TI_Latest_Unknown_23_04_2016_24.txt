During the 1992 Bosnian war between The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republika Srpska, Novalic is alleged to have committed war crimes against civilians in the municipality of Konjic.
It is alleged that on an unspecified day in September 1992 at around 22:00 hrs, Novalic together with an unidentified member of the Bosnian and Herzegovinian army, visited Dzepa village, in Konjic. Armed with rifles and wearing multi-coloured camouflage uniforms and forehead bands, they entered the house of Stanko and Borka Saran. The unidentified soldier questioned Stanko Saran in the basement, while Novalic reportedly ordered his wife to go upstairs and then forced her to have sexual intercourse with him. He threatened to kill her with a rifle if she screamed.
