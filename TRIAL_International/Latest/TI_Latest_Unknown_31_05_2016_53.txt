facts

Tommy Franks was born on 1 June 1945 in Wynnewood, Oklahoma. At the time of the events he was commander in chief of the American-British coalition forces in Iraq.
The third war against Iraq started with the bombing of Bagdad on 20 March 2003.
Attacks were allegedly directed against civilians. Shootings of unarmed civilians occurred on 15 April 2003, and residential areas were bombed on 6 April 2004.
Furthermore, it was claimed that cluster bombs were deployed. The use of cluster bombs is very contentious as their effect is widespread, thereby increasing the risk of civilian casualties. Moreover, 5-10% of cluster bombs have effects equivalent to those of landmines since they do not explode on impact but can remain lying unexploded in the ground for years.
On 14 April 2003, for instance, civilians were injured when cluster bombs were used. In addition, on 12, 16 and 19 April children were reportedly injured by cluster bombs.
It is alleged that there were repeated attacks on medical personnel and medical infrastructures. On 7 April 2003, two pregnant women died when an ambulance was attacked. On 9 April ambulances on their way to hospitals at Al Kindi and Al-Liqaâ€™a respectively were attacked.
American- British armed forces did nothing to prevent looting which occurred in the early stages of the war. The complaint made reference for example to the cultural centre Al Bail Iraqi the main sections of which were destroyed on 8 April 2003 during an attack. Although American forces mounted the guard in this area, the looting continued without the American soldiers intervening.
The complaint cited Tommy Franks as having ordered the above mentioned acts or alternatively that he had knowledge of them but then failed to prevent or punish their commission.
On 14 May 2003, 17 Iraqi and 2 Jordanian citizens filed a complained against Tommy Franks in Belgium.
