Marlene Raquel Blanco Lapola was born in 1966 and entered the police force at age 22 as a police agent. She later joined the field of research in the Division of Criminal Investigation (DINC) where she specialised in the investigation of kidnappings and robberies. She also worked on issues of personnel systems, logistics, armaments and implementing police units.
In 2008 Blanco served as director of the National Civil Police for nine months and in 2009 she was appointed Deputy Minister of Community Support.
In 2008, Blanco allegedly led a taskforce created with the aim of identifying cases of extortion within the public transport system in Guatemala’s capital city.
Blanco allegedly ran a death squad that tortured and murdered people suspected of extorting and murdering bus drivers. This taskforce was allegedly under the command of Blanco and worked to locate and murder people suspected of extorting money from urban transport businesspersons. The organisation is accused of murdering three people: Rosa del Carmen Coyoy Ixcot (November, 2009); Lauro Oswaldo Andrino (October, 2009) and Jonhy Estuardo Sac Rojas (June, 2009).
The CICIG (International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala) and Public Prosecutor’s Office’s investigations determined that in response to the money extorted from transport businesspersons, the officers involved were given instructions from their superiors to take tough measures against the extortionists, including killing them.
On June 17, 2011, as part of the case, Juan Carlos Rojas Salguero and Martín García Hernández, former police agents under Blanco’s responsibility at the time of the events, were sentenced to 25 years in prison.
On 23 March 2012, Blanco was arrested for alleged involvement in extra-judicial killings in 2009. She has been charged with three murders and is being held in custody.
