facts

Zeljko Ilic, originally from the Bileca region, is a Serb from Bosnia. He was a member of the public security station in Bileca where he was a police officer during the Bosnian war between 1992 and 1995.
He is under investigation, predominantly, for events that took place between June to December in 1992 when members of the public security station in Bileca mistreated and tortured Bosnian and Croatian civilians because of their nationality or religious beliefs.
Ilic is accused, along with Nedjoljko Kuljic in their capacity as police officers, of physical and emotional mistreatment, torture and murder of detainees of the public security station in Bileca, as well as other civilians who were detained in the Bileca student dormitories. These acts formed part of a larger, systematically targeted attack against the Bosnian and Croatian people. The attack was led by the army of the Serbian Republic of Bosnia in the Bileca region.
A prosecutor from the Special Department for War Crimes of Bosnia Herzegovina indicted Ilic in January 2014. His trial began on 17 June 2014 and he was accompanied by Goran Vujovic, head of the public security station in Bileca, Miroslav Duka, a police commander, and Nedjeljko Kuljic, another police officer.
