Macías Nguema was the first president of the newly independent Equatorial Guinea in 1968. After his election, on 29 September 1968, he established a single-party system and seized all powers, including the legislature and the judiciary. As early as 1969, Macías Nguema unleashed a campaign to persecute his political opponents who where arrested, their goods looted and extorted. A fierce political repression was implemented, in particular through the terrible “Youth on the March with Macías” militia who was responsible for numerous atrocities, including massacre of civilian population, torture, looting and burning of villages.
The country felt under a brutal and cruel dictatorship. On 14 July 1972, Macías Nguema was named president for Life and initiated an extreme cult of personality, proclaiming himself as the “Unique Miracle”.
During his bloody regime, systematic human rights violations were committed such as arbitrary detention, persecution, torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatments, and extrajudicial execution of “subversive” elements. He introduced forced labour for all citizens over 15. He banned all private education as “subversive”. His persecution against intellectual drained the educated class out of the country. Approximately one third of the population was either exiled or murdered. His human right abuses were denounced by the UN and by the European Commission, as well as by several NGOs.
He was overthrown on 3 August 1979 by a military coup led by his nephew, Teodoro Obiang Nguema.
