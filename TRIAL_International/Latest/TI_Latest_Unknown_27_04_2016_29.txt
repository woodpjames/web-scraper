facts

Héctor Roderico Ramirez Rios was born in Cabricán, in the Department of Quetzaltenango, Guatemala, on 23 December 1957.
Since the early 1980s he served in the police forces of Guatemala. At the beginning of its service, in particular, he was an agent of the Special Operations Brigade (Brigada de Operaciones Especiales, BROE) of the National Police (Policia Nacional).
On 18 February 1984 Ramirez Rios – together with Abraham Lancerio Gomez and other agents of the BROE – kidnapped in Guatemala City the 27 years old Edgar Fernando Garcia. Garcia was a student of the faculty of engineering and an employee at the glass factory known as ‘Industria Centroamericana de Vidrio’. He was also a trade union leader and a member of the association of university students, linked to the Guatemalan Labor Party (Partido Guatemalteco del Trabajo). Due to his political orientation, he was seen as a threat by those who ordered his murder.
Since his abduction, Garcia was never seen again, and his body was never found. Its case stayed unsolved until 2005, when a 500 pages file was found in an abandoned section of the Policia Nacional archives. An investigation was immediately opened by the Human Rights division of the Guatemalan Public Prosecutor’s Office.
On 5 March 2009 Ramirez Rios, in the meanwhile become Police Commissioner at Quetzaltenango, was summoned to appear in front of the Office of Professional Responsibility in Guatemala City. There he was arrested for his alleged involvement in the Fernando Garcia disappearance.
