Joakim Bučko was “Political Commissar” of the Territorial Defense Forces of the Yugoslav Republics in the self-proclaimed autonomous Oblast of Krajina in Croatia. This military unit, together with the Yugoslav People’s Army, fought against the forces of the Republic of Croatia on behalf of the Serbian minority between August 1991 and May 1992.
He is accused of having participated in the killings, torture and robbery of non-Serbian civilians living in the village Miklusevci.
On 18 May 1992, with Jovan Cico and other members of the Territorial Defence Forces, he allegedly forced the 98 residents of the village of Miklusevci to leave their homes by throwing explosives and threatening them with firearms. They then proceeded to stealing their money, jewellery and other valuable possessions. According to the victims’ testimonies, four persons were killed and six other were tortured and beaten. These acts were performed on behalf of the illegal government of the Serb Autonomous Region of Krajina with the objective of expelling the non-Serbian population from the territory.
