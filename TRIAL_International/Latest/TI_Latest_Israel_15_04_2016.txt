Israel Chávez is accused of having led one of several illegal security units, operating within the National Civil Police and the Governor’s Office in Guatemala. Under the orders of the ex-Vice Minister of the Police, Marlene Blanco Lapola, Chávez and two other colleagues tracked down, tortured and eliminated at least three persons suspected of having extorted money from bus operators. The killings took place in June, October and November 2009. The victims of the illegal operation were Rosa del Carmen Coyoy, Lauro Oswaldo Andrino and Johny Estuardo Sac Rojas.
Investigations started after a tip-off in 2010 by the then Vice Minister of Community Support, Francisco Cuevas, who is now the Social Media Secretary of the President’s Office. Other accused persons are Lino Efrén García (former policeman and Counsel of the National Civil Police), Juan Carlos Rojas (former policeman), and Mártir García Hernández (former police agent).
Israel Chávez was arrested in a concerted action by the National Civil Police, the General Prosecutor and investigators of the Comisión Internacional Contra la Impunidad en Guatemala (CICIG) in Guatemala on 23 March 2012.
