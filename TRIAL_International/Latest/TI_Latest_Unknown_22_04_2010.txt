facts

Callixte Gakwaya was a Rwandan lawyer. He was defence counsel at the International Criminal Tribunal (ICTR) for Yusuf Munyakazi, a former Interahamwe leader and businessman from Cyangugu. Prior to this, Gakwaya was an official in the national sports ministry under Habyarimana.
On 28 February 2006, Gakwaya’s appointment to the ICTR garnered controversy when Rwanda’s reprensentative to the ICTR, Aloys Mutabingwa, revealed that Callixte Gakwaya was amongst the suspects of the genocide, according to a list released by the Rwandan government to Interpol.
When Rwanda launched this accusation, Gakwaya sought refuge in Mozambique. Following that, Rwanda delivered an international arrest warrant, transmitted to the ICTR and to Tanzania.
