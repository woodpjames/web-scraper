facts

Zlatan Mancic was a lieutenant-colonel in the Serbian Army throughout the Kosovo conflict in 1998 and 1999.
The incidents that led to Mančić’s conviction date back to April 1999 in the region of Kushnin in Kosovo. In early April 1999, Mančić ordered two soldiers, Danilo Tesic and Misel Seregi, to kill two Albanian civilians suspected of espionage for the Kosovo Liberation Army.
The two soldiers kidnapped the two Albanian civilians then executed them by shooting them in the back. Afterwards they burnt the two Albanian civilian’s bodies. A few days later, the soldier, Tesic, handed himself in to the military police and confessed to the crime he had committed.
Eventually Mančić was arrested by the military police on 9 May 1999. He denied the murders, insisting they were a figment of Tesic and Seregi‘s imaginations.
