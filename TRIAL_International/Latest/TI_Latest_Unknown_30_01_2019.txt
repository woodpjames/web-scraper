“Mr. President, make reparations in the DRC a priority during your term”
30.01.2019
Access to reparations remains an almost insurmountable obstacle for victims of serious crimes seeking justice in DRC. A bill aiming to make it easier for them to uphold this right was introduced in the Senate several months ago. Guy Mushiata, Human Rights Coordinator in DRC for TRIAL International, calls on the new president, Félix Tshisekedi, to make this matter a priority during his term. 
“In the DRC, there have been no redress pay-outs for mass crimes to date. This is despite several judgments ordering the Congolese State to pay compensation. This is also the case with sexual violence, even though victims are counted in tens of thousands.
It is in order to fill this gap that a bill was presented to Parliament several months ago. To make it easier for victims of sexual violence to receive compensations, it proposes to create a National Reparations Commission.”
