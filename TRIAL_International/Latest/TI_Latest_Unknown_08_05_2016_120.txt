facts

Joseph Kony was born in 1961 to an impoverished family in the northern Ugandan village of Odek.
He is the alleged Commander-in-Chief of the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA), a rebel group which terrorizes the civilian population in Northern Uganda (see ”context“).
In April 2005, in the course of a reorganisation of the LRA’s four brigades, Joseph Kony reportedly promoted himself from Lieutenant General to General while remaining chairman of the LRA.
Kony developed from an altar-boy and school drop-out to a cruel and elusive rebel leader who proclaimed himself a spirit medium, a lord and liberator. He believes that he received orders from the Holy Spirit to form the LRA and liberate the people of Uganda „from corruption, sins and immoral thinking“. Whereas Kony’s exact political goals remain unclear, he is said to aim at erecting a Ugandan theocracy based on the Ten Commandments.
Kony with his LRA emerged in 1987 as a successor to the Holy Spirit Movement, a previous northern rebellion led by his aunt, the mystic Alice Lakwena.
On 13 October 2005, the International Criminal Court issued unsealed arrest warrants for five LRA leaders including Kony, and transmitted them to Uganda, the Congo and Sudan.
At this time, Ugandan government sources said that Kony was camped near the Sudanese town of Liria, 60 km north of the so-called “red line”. The “red line“ is marked by a cross-country road about 100 km into the country up to which Ugandan forces may, based on a 2002 agreement with Sudan, pursue the LRA on Sudanese territory.
On 10 October 2005 however, the Ugandan government reported that Sudan had given them free reign, during one month, to pursue the LRA anywhere across the border.
