facts

Miroslav Bralo, a Croatian citizen known by the nickname of “Cicko”, was born on 13 October 1967 in Kratine in the municipality of Vitez. He was a member of the “Jokers”, an anti-terrorist unit of the military police of the Croatian Defence Council (HVO), and was charged with committing a series of crimes within the context of the ethnic cleansing of the Muslim population.
From January to July 1993, the HVO and the armed forces of the Government of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina (ABiH) were engaged in armed conflict. During the period of widespread and systematic attacks against the Muslims in the village of Ahmici, Bralo committed several crimes against humanity. Aided and abetted by other members of the HVO, he set fire to numerous Muslim houses in the village of Ahmici, destroyed with explosives the village mosque and forcibly expelled Muslim citizens. He also participated in the arrest and subsequent execution of several men, women and children who had fled their homes and had been forbidden residence in the Kratine region.
A Muslim woman who was detained by the HVO for several months was repeatedly raped by Bralo in front of other members of the armed forces. In the course of these rapes, the accused bit the victim all over her body, inflicting serious injuries on her. A man was also seriously beaten in his presence.
In collusion with other HVO soldiers, Bralo held Bosnian Muslim civilians in confinement and forced those civilians to dig trenches around the village of Kratine. At gun point, the prisoners worked under difficult weather conditions with limited food and rest and were used as human shields against shots fired from snipers of the ABiH. In addition, Bralo forced Muslim prisoners to practice the rites of the Catholic religion under threat of physical harm and death.
After taking preliminary steps to surrender in 1997, Miroslav Bralo finally surrendered voluntarily to the judicial authorities on 12 November 2004.
