Sexual violence: The courage to testify
10.01.2019
Last spring, Selma Korjenić, Head of the Bosnia and Herzegovina program, traveled to Athens with a rape survivor supported by TRIAL International to meet with women migrants. Read about her experience below. 
“Fighting for one’s rights is never a waste of time. For victims of sexual violence, testifying means not only sharing experiences, but sometimes also encouraging others to speak up. This is exactly what happened when Semka Agic and I went to Athens to meet local NGOs that help migrants.
As a survivor of rape during the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Semka is one of the women who have obtained justice with the help of TRIAL International. In Greece, she shared her story with women migrants from Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq and several countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. Forced to migrate, these women are particularly vulnerable to various forms of sexual violence. I remember one of them was visibly shaken by Semka’s testimony; she suddenly realized that she was not alone in having suffered atrocities. She spoke up later that day to unload her own burden.”
