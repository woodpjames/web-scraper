Kurmanbek Bakiyev was born on 1 August 1949. He was the leader of the Peopleâ€™s Movement of Kyrgyzstan.
Former Prime Minister, Bakiyev became President of Kyrgystan in 2005. A few months later, voices rose from both the opposition and his party to denounce his authoritarianism. From 2006, numerous protests were organised throughout the country. In 2009, the country slid into an authoritarian regime: several newspapers are closed and political opponents are harassed. In 2009, Bakiyev was re-elected but these elections were improper and qualified as suspicious by the OSCE.
In the spring of 2010, protests in the capital Bichkek were organised following the closing of newspapers and the arrests of several opponents. Between 6 and 8 April 2010, violence erupted all over the capital. Numerous fights took place between protesters and security forces that used tear gas, rubber bullets and grenades to disperse the crowd.
On 8 April, the opponents seized power. On 15 April 2010, Bakiyev fled to Belarus, where he became a political refugee.
Around 85 persons were killed and hundreds wounded during those protests.
