facts

Eduardo Cabanillas was born on 9 April 1942 in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Cabanillas joined the Argentinean Army in 1963. From August to November 1976, he worked in the General Command of the Army as captain in the State Intelligence Service (SIDE), within the IT Department, which served as a secret detention centre known as “Automotores Orletti”.
“Automotores Orletti” was under the jurisdiction of the First Army Corps, and served as a base for foreign intelligence services. The intelligence services operated in Argentina in the context of Plan Condor, a military cooperation between dictatorships of the Southern Cone for the elimination of political opponents.
Also known as “El Jardín” (The Garden), it is believed that around 200 political prisoners were detained in “Automotores Orletti”, from countries such as Uruguay, Argentina, Chile, Bolivia, Cuba and Brazil. The illegal detention centre was disguised as an automobile mechanical workshop. The victims were deprived of their liberty, transferred to the centre, detained, subjected to torture, and some were murdered.
