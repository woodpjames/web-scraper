Savo Babic served as Military Police Commander of Bratunac, a town near Srebrenica, in May 1992. In this position he was allegedly in charge of monitoring and securing the detention facility located in the primary school “Vuk Karadžić”. The more than 400 non-Serb inmates of this detention center were subjugated, on a daily basis, to systematic interrogations, beatings, torture, physical and mental abuse, humiliation, and many were, as a result, killed.
Babic allegedly ordered, committed and knowingly omitted to prevent, by his acts and omissions, the abuse of the detained Bosniak civilians.
The trial dealing with the crimes committed in Bratunac started in September 2012.
