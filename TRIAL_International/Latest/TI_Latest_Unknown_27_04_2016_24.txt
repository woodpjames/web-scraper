José Alarcón Gonzáles, also known as José Concepción Alarcón Gonzáles, was born on 11 June 1960 in the Querocoto district, in the province of Chota, in Peru.
Serving as operational intelligence assistant in the Peruvian Army, Alarcon Gonzales dealt primarily with information providing and security issues. In March 1991 he became the chief of security for General Nicolás de Bari Hermoza Ríos. He maintained such position until the first months of 1992.
At the beginning of 1992, Alarcón Gonzáles took part in some operations of the paramilitary squad known as ‘Grupo Colina’ – notably those in Paramonga, in Pamplona Alta-Chanchería, in the Carretera Central and in El Santa.
Eventually, on 11 May 1992, he became a formal member of ‘Grupo Colina’. The latter was a task force created – within the Peruvian army’s structure – with the aim to kill all the commanders and the persons suspected to be members of rebel groups operating in Peru, and especially those belonging to the group known as ‘Shining Path’.
Alarcón Gonzáles allegedly took part in some of the most famous operations of Grupo Colina. He was responsible for the security of the operations and of the other members of the group.
On 2 May 1992 the group killed nine farmers in the little town of El Santa, in the region of Ancash.
On 24 June 1992 the journalist Pedro Yauri Bustamante disappeared: he was abducted and then summarily executed by members of Grupo Colina.
On 18 July 1992 Grupo Colina – under the orders of Santiago Martin Rivas – assailed the La Cantuta University, in Lima, deemed to be a recruiting center of the Shining Path movement. The operation resulted in the abduction and subsequent murder of nine students and one professor.
In the early 2000s, several criminal proceedings were started in Peru against eminent politicians, members of the military structure and members of Grupo Colina.
