A former member of the Croatian Police, Drago Bosnjak took an active part in the clashes between the Serbs and the Croats between 1991 and 1992 which took place during the Balkan War. In particular, he commanded ‘The Wolves’, a special unit of the police forces in the Croatian city of Sisak.
Sisak is located at around 50 kilometres south of Zagreb and 10 kilometres from what was considered the front line between the Croatian and Serbian forces during the secession wars of the former Yugoslavia in 1991.
In August 1991, under the direction of Croatian police commander Vlado Milanković, Bosnjak was allegedly responsible for the arbitrary detention, abuse and deaths of eight Serb civilians. These eight persons formed part of a larger group of 24 Serbs whose deaths have also been attributed to Milanković.
On 20 June 2011, the Croatian authorities arrested Drago Bosnjak along with Vlado Milanković and Djuro Brodrac, all former officials of the Sisak police, on charges of war crimes committed against Serb civilians between 1991 and 1992. As a result of Brodarac’s death a month thereafter, the case continued against Bosnjak and Milanković alone.
