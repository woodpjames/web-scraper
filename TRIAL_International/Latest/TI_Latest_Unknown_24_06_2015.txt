facts

Abdul-Ghani Abdul-Ghafour was a member of the Iraqi Ba’ath party regional command, responsible for the southern area organisations and member of the advanced headquarters for armed forces in Basra.
At the end of the 1991 Gulf War, Arab Shi’a Muslims revolted against the Iraqi government and briefly took control of several towns and cities, including Najaf and Basra. There were fierce military clashes, which ended in Iraqi security forces brutally crushing the uprising. Thousands of people were reportedly arrested some of whom were subsequently summarily executed. Abdul-Ghafour is alleged to have participated in wilful killings in that context.
It appears that Abdul-Ghafour was arrested by US forces (date unclear) and handed over the the Iraqi authorities under the Status of Forces Agreement, under which all those detained by US forces were to be handed over to the Iraqi authorities.
