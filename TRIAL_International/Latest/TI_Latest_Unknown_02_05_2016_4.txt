facts

Aziz Salih Al-Numan was born in Nasiriyah, Iraq in 1941. Some sources give 1944 as his date of birth.
Al-Numan started his career as a Baath functionary; he rose from low-key provincial positions thanks to his reputed loyalty.
He is the former Governor of occupied Kuwait, Basrah, Dhi Qar, Najaf, and Karbala. He was also at one time minister of irrigation and agriculture.
According to press reports, he ordered the destruction of Shiite holy sites when he was Governor of Karbala (1977-83) and Najaf (1983-86). He was accused of arresting, torturing and killing Shiite clerics during the 1980-88 Iraq-Iran war.
During the 1990 invasion of Kuwait, he was appointed Governor of Kuwait for administrative affairs with the rank of minister, along with Saddam’s half brother Sabawai, who was Governor for security affairs and Saddam’s cousin Ali Hassan al-Majid, who was Governor for military affairs.
As Governor of occupied Kuwait between November 1990 and February 1991, he continued the policy of “reintegrating Iraq’s 19th province”.
He was prominent in the quelling of the Shiite uprising in the south in March 1991 in the immediate aftermath of the U.S.-led attack that ousted the Iraqi army from Kuwait. He had a reputation for cruel treatment of the rebels, and was accused by opposition groups of killing and torture.
In June 2002 the anti-Saddam group known as the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq said that Al-Numan had been wounded in the arms and legs in an assassination attempt the previous month in the southern city of Amara. It asserted that Al-Numan was responsible for “vicious crimes against our citizens”.
Al-Numan was the Baath Party’s regional command chairman responsible for west Baghdad.
He was taken into U.S. custody on 20 April 2003.
