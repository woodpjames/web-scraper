facts

Kononov was born on 1 January 1923 in the district of Ludza, Latvia. He held Latvian nationality until 2000, when he was granted Russian nationality by special decree. In 1940 when Soviet troops entered Latvia, he joined the Komsomol (Soviet Youth Organization). In July 1943 he retreated with the Red Army and was trained in Izhevsk as demolition specialist.
In June 1943 Kononov was air-dropped in Belarus which was occupied by Nazi-German forces at the time. As a member of 1st Latvian Partisan Brigade he proved to be one of the most successful sabotage demolitionists, and thus was appointed head of a demolition group and in 1944 head of the Partisan Brigade.
In February 1944 the German army had discovered and executed a group of Red Partisans led by Major Chugunov who were hiding in the barn of Meikuls Krupniks in the village of Mazie Bati. The German military administration had provided some men in Mazie Bati with a rifle and two grenades each. Kononov and his unit suspected the villagers of having spied for the Germans and of having turned in Chugunov’s men to the enemy.
On 27 May 1944 Kononov and his unit, armed and wearing German uniforms entered the village of Mazie Bati. The unit split up into a number of small groups each of which attacked a house on Kononv’s orders. After finding rifles and grenades in the houses of six farmers (Modests Krupniks, Meikuls Krupniks, Ambrozs Buïs, Vladislavs Ðíirmants, Juliâns Ðíirmants, Bernards Ðíirmants), the members of the Partisan brigade executed them and their wives and set their houses on fire. Krupniks’ wife, who was nine months pregnant, managed to escape, but was seized by the partisans and pushed through a window of the house into the flames.
In July 1944 the Red Army entered Latvia and on 8 May 1945 Latvian territory came under the control of the USSR forces. Kononov remained in Latvia after the war ended. He was decorated for his military activities with the Order of Lenin. Until his retirement in 1988, he worked as an officer in various branches of the Soviet police force.
On 4 May 1990 the Supreme Council of the Latvian SSR adopted the “Declaration of the Restoration of Independence of the Republic of Latvia”, which declared Latvia’s incorporation into the USSR in 1940 unlawful and reinstituted the 1922 Constitution.
In July 1998 the Centre for the Documentation of the Consequences of Totalitarianism, based in Latvia, forwarded an investigation file on the events of 27 May 1944 to the Latvian Principal Public Prosecutor’s Office. In August 1998 Kononov was charged with war crimes. In October 1998 he was brought before the Riga Central Court of First Instance and his pre-trial detention was ordered.
On 1 April 2011, Kononov died at age 89 in Riga.
