facts

Maksim Sokolovic is a Serb resident of Germany.
In May 1992 he took part in a Serb campaign against the Muslim population of Osmaci. This campaign was part of systematic plan to displace or eliminate such population.
For this purpose, the houses of the Muslim inhabitants were raided while the women and children were deported or sent to the border. The male population was physically mistreated or murdered and many of them were sent to detention camps.
This action was part of the Bosnian Serb joint policy of ethnic-cultural unification. Sokolovic, who knew and approved of this goal, personally oversaw the displacement of the inhabitants of Osmaci, he personally persecuted the Muslim men and physically mistreated five prisoners. Furthermore, he took part in the surveillance of the building where the prisoners were detained overnight and where the worst mistreatments were carried out.
From this first detention camp, the prisoners that had not been selected for execution were transported by bus in confinement camps. Sokolovic personally oversaw the transfer of 56 men and took the necessary steps to prevent them from escaping while they were lead to the bystanding busses under the infliction of kicks and blows.
Makisim Sokolovic remained in Germany for 20 years before being arrested. He was registered as unemployed and received a pension from the German State.
