Why remembering Srebrenica is simply not enough
10.07.2017
A conflict at the doors of the EU. Civilians fleeing the attacks. A toothless international community unable to protect them. Thousands of dead.
Aleppo in 2017? No, Srebrenica in 1995.
This week, we commemorate the anniversary of the biggest massacre in Europe since World War II. On 11 July 1995, Bosnian Serbs led by Ratko Mladic murdered over 8’000 Bosniaks in the enclave of Srebrenica. The international community watched helplessly.
The parallels between the situation then and now are harshly obvious. Despite the “never again” leitmotiv traditional to commemoration ceremonies, we have failed – spectacularly failed – to prevent mass atrocities since.
Syria offers a resounding, quasi-daily example of our inertia in the face of barbarity. Many other conflicts do not make the headlines but are equally tragic: South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mexico and others.
