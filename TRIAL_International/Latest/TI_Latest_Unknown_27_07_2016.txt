Facts

Heriberto Valdez Asij was a military commissioner during the 36-year civil war in Guatemala. Military commissioners responded to army command and were integrated into the military structure, despite being paramilitaries. Valdez Asij commanded the civil self-defence patrols (PAC) in the municipality of Panzós and was stationed around the Sepur Zarco military base in eastern Guatemala from April 1982. Before he became a military commissioner, Valdez Asij was a municipal police officer in Panzós.
The Sepur Zarco military base was set up in late 1981, during the presidency of Efraín Ríos Montt, when local landowners complained about Mayan Q’eqchi’ peasant leaders trying to acquire legal titles to the land on which they lived and worked. The military repeatedly attacked the village and seized at least 15 Q’eqchi’ men, who were then killed or forcibly disappeared.
Shortly thereafter, in 1982, soldiers forced at least 15 Q’eqchi’ women – wives of the murdered and disappeared men – into sexual and domestic slavery at the Sepur Zarco base. The women were required to report to the base every two or three days for their ‘’shifts’’, during which they were forced to cook and clean and were systematically raped. This ‘’shift’’ system ended after about ten months, but some of the women were enslaved at the base for up to six years. Some of the women were able to escape into the mountains with their families, but many of their children died from hunger and exposure. The Sepur Zarco military base closed in 1988.
