facts

Ante Gotovina was born on 12 October 1955 on the Pasman Island in the Croatian Republic. He fled from Yugoslavia in 1973, but returned in 1991 at the start of the war.
On 25 June 1991, the Croatian Republic proclaimed its independence from the Federal Socialist Republic of Yugoslavia. On 19 December 1991, the autonomous Serb region of Krajina (an enclave with a Serbian majority within the Croatian Republic) seceded and officially declared its independence from Croatia.
In June 1991, Gotovina was appointed Commander of Operations and Military Training in the First Brigade Corps of the National Guard. From February until April 1992, he held the position of Second-Commander of the Special Unit of the General Staff of the Croatian Army.
On 9 October 1992, Ante Gotovina was appointed Commander of the Operations Zone of Split. He held this position until March 1996. It was in the role of Operations Commander of the Croatian Forces that he directed “Operation Storm”, launched against Serbian Krajina on 4 August 1995.
The objective of this military offensive, according to the indictment, was to recapture the enclave from the Serbs and expel them from the territory. This operation lasted until around 15 November 1995.
Between 4 August 1995 and 15 November 1995, Ante Gotovina, either on his own or with the help of others, was reported to have persecuted, expelled and murdered numerous Serbs from Krajina. By doing so, he was accused of being the root cause of the death of 150 Serb civilians and of the expulsion of 150’000 others.
Ante Gotovina was officially indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) on 21 May 2001. He was arrested in Spain (Canary Islands) on 7 December 2005 and transferred to the ICTY on 10 December 2005.
