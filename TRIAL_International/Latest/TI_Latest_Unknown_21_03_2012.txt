Abdi Hasan Awale Qeybdiid was born in Somalia in 1948 and became a member of the Somali National Alliance. As a Somali warlord, he took part in the “Abdi House Raid” and became known as “Mad Abdi”.
He was appointed commander of Farah Aidid’s troops that fought United States forces during the First Battle of Mogadishu (also referred to as the Battle of the Black Sea or The Day of the Rangers). In 1993 the United States Army and Special Forces arrested Qeybdiid and he remained in custody for several months before his release. His arrest was portrayed in the film, Black Hawk Down.
In 2001, Qeybdiid became Chief of Police in Mogadishu as part of the new Transitional National Government, under the dictator Mohamed Siad Barre.
Qeybdiid’s forces fought on behalf of the Alliance for the Restoration of Peace and Counter-Terrorism against the Islamic Courts Union (ICU) in the Second Battle of Mogadishu in 2006, in two days of fighting that killed more than 140 people. His forces were amongst the last group to surrender.
Qeybdiid was accused of ordering the execution of captured child soldiers in the Somali town of Kismayo in 1991.
In 2005 Qeybdiid was arrested in Lund, Sweden after Somalis living in Sweden recognised him and reported him to the police. He was arrested on suspicion of genocide.
