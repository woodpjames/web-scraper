Facts

Al Hassan Ag Abdoul Aziz Ag Mohamed Ag Mahmoud was born on 19 September 1977 in the region of Timbuktu, Mali. He belongs to the Tuareg tribe Kel Ansar.
In 2012, Timbuktu came under the control of jihadists from al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the Ansar Eddine. The groups were waging an insurgency against the Malian government since 2012 and introduced an extreme interpretation of the sharia law.
Al Hassan allegedly became a member of the Ansar Eddine. He reportedly became de facto the chief of the Islamic police in Timbuktu and held the position between the beginning of April 2012 and 17 January 2013. Al Hassan reportedly took part in the work of the Islamic court of the Ansar Eddine militia and the execution of its decisions.
Al Hassan allegedly participated in the destruction of ancient mausoleums of Muslim saints in Timbuktu through Islamic police forces. He is also suspected of having taken part in the enforcement of a radical sharia policy of forced marriages. This policy led to repeated rapes and the reduction of Fulani women and girls to sexual slavery.
Al Hassan fled Timbuktu in January 2013 after the intervention of French forces and the Malian army in the region.
