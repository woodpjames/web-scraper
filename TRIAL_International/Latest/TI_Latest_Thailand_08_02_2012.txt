DRC and Thailand: UN Committee on the Rights of the Child follows TRIAL's demands
08.02.2012
n November 2011, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child issued its Concluding Observations concerning the Democratic Republic of Congo and Thailand, setting forth a series of recommendations in line with what TRIAL had called for in its alternative reports submitted in April and August 2011.
In April and August 2011, TRIAL had submitted to the Committee two reports, the core of which was a critical analysis of Congolese and Thai domestic legislation underlining their incompatibility with the provisions of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Involvment of Children in Armed ConflictÂ and dealing with the obligation to introduce domestic criminal provisions allowing the repression of the crimes related to children involvement in armed conflict and the prosecution of these offences according to the principle of universal jurisdiction.
In brief, the Committee followed TRIAL demands requesting the two States to adopt domestic provisions properly criminalizing the different crimes related to children involvement in armed conflict and allowing the prosecution of alleged offenders, even for acts committed abroad, only by the very fact that the suspect is found on their territory.
TRIAL had submitted a third report concerning Greece in 2011. The Committee should issue its Observations on Greece during its next session in June 2012.
