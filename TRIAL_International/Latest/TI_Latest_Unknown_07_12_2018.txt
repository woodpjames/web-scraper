Better access to compensation for victims of sexual violence
07.12.2018
A few weeks ago, TRIAL International organized a training course for judges and prosecutors. The objective: to give them the necessary tools to facilitate the access to compensation for victims of sexual violence during the war. 
How can we provide comfort to victims of sexual violence? Is the perpetrator’s conviction sufficient to enable them to regain control of their destinies? On 16 November, more than fifteen judges and prosecutors from the cantonal courts of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina met for a training session at the invitation of TRIAL International and the Center for Education of Judges and Prosecutors of FBiH. Up for discussion was how to claim compensation for victims of sexual violence during the war.
In the Bosnian context, in which the events took place more than twenty years ago, the need for justice is still present and the burden borne by victims is often very real. TRIAL International has been fighting for years to ensure that victims’ access to justice and reparations is improved. In the last couple of years, focus has been put on financial compensation in criminal proceedings, in addition to the conviction of the perpetrators of these crimes.
