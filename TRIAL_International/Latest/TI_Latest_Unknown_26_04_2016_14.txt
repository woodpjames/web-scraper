Luis Joachim Ramirez Pineda was born on 1 July 1925. He was formerly a commander of the Tacna Regiment, the artillery regiment of the Chilean army. He was involved in acts of kidnapping, torture and disappearances during the dictatorship of General Augusto Pinochet (1973 to 1990), leaving thousands of victims, many of whom were French. Georges Klein, Etienne Pesle, Alphonse Chanfreau and Jean Yves Claudet were among the French victims.
It is alleged that during the early hours of the morning on 11 September 1973, the day of the coup d’état, the aforementioned people were at the presidential palace, La Moneda, which was bombed. Around 2 o’clock in the afternoon, they were taken as prisoners along with around forty of President Allende’s staff, by members of the Chilean army. These prisoners were then transported to the Tacna Regiment. On 12 September 1973, the 16 police officers who were among the prisoners were freed. The next day, at around 2 o’clock in the afternoon, Georges Klein and the other remaining prisoners were tied up and packed into a dumper truck before being taken to Peldehue firing ranges. Here, they were forced to dig their own graves before being killed with machine guns.
There were no legal proceedings following the disappearance of Georges Klein, nor after the disappearances of several other victims of the Chilean dictatorship, until the arrest of General Augusto Pinochet on 16 October 1998 in London. This arrest was carried out in compliance with an international arrest warrant issued by the Spanish judge, Baltasar Garzón. The families of nine French victims then sought justice from this country, which began legal proceedings against Ramirez Pineda and 18 Chileans
