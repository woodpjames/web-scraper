Facts

Abdallah Kallel is a Tunisian politician under the Ben Ali regime, who was twice Minister of Defence (1988-1991 and 1996-1997) and twice Minister of Interior (1991-1995 and 1999-2001), before becoming President of the Chamber of Advisors from 2005 to 2011.
Kallel was a member of the Democratic Constitutional Rally (RCD) from 1988 until his radiation in 2011, after the Tunisian Revolution. During his political carrier within the RCD, he was considered one of the falcons of the regime and was treasurer of the party since its very foundation. In this capacity, he was allegedly responsible of misappropriation of funds of the party.
During his term of office as Minister of Interior, several instances of torture at the hands of the police have been reported. In particular:

On 22 May 1991, Kallel announced the discovery of an alleged military plot to overturn the regime and blamed the Ennhada party as responsible. 244 members of the armed forces were arrested, brought to premises of the Ministry of Interior and allegedly tortured for weeks. Only after the Tunisian Revolution the authorities admitted that the so called “Affaire Barraket Essahel” was a fake to purge the army of suspected opponents.


A Tunisian citizen, Abdennacer Nait-Liman, was arbitrarily detained in the premises of the Ministry of Interior for forty days, in April 1992. He reportedly suffered various forms of torture, including deprivation of sleep, beatings and coercion to remain in stress positions for prolonged periods of time. Kallel allegedly ordered the torture on the victim.
