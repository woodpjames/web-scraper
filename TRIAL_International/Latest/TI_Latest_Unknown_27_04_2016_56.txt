facts

Gerhard Dosse was born in Fuerstenberg in Germany on 22 March 1909.
During the occupation of Italy, he was a captain of the Wehrmacht for the military district of Rostock, chief of the first battalion of the infantry regiment 80 (34th infantry division called “Rheinische”) leaded by general Theobald Hehnut Lieb. Dosse had the command responsability of the Feldgendarmerie of Albenga.
The Feldgendarmerie instituted “Standgericht” in order to prosecute partisans. These were summary judgments which violated German laws. The accused did not have the right to a lawyer, they could not follow the discussions openly and could be sentenced to death for any kind of offense.
In Albenga, 71 people have been killed. The responsability of Dosse was alleged for the massacre of Foce del Centa.
According to Luberti, (called il Boia di Albenga), one of his co-accused, the “Hauptmann” (capitano) Dosse would have committed suicide on 29 or 30 April 1945 in the Piedmont region during the retreat. However, the military prosecutor for the military tribunal of Torino, Pier Paolo Rivello, continued to look for Dosse with the help of Interpol and of the Marshal of Albenga, Marco Chiarone. They finally found his address in Germany in 2003. Contrary to the rumours, Dosse was alive and had not committed suicide.
In Wiesbaden, he was interrogated by the Kriminalamt of the German magistracy and pleaded not guilty. He even tried to kill himself. After the procedure was archived in 2000 due to a lack of evidence, new proofs eventually conducted to the trial of Dosse, who had lived free of any judgement for 50 years.
