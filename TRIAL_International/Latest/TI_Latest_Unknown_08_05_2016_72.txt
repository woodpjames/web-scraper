facts

Jerome Kakwavu, from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, is a former warlord of Ituri in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and former president of the People’s Armed Forces of Congo (FAPC). The FAPC is one of many militias that fought in Ituri between 1999 and 2007. The clashes, predominantly between different ethnic groups, were centred on the division of natural riches, in particular that of gold. The militias controlled illegal border checkpoints between Uganda and the DRC, which were essential transit paths for the movement of arms.
As president of the FAPC, Kakwavu was influential on the organisation’s politics and he commanded and controlled their armed forces. In this role, he is accused of committing the following war crimes in 2004: repeated rape of two minors, of whom one was younger than 13 years old, two murders, and acts of torture against two other people.
In December 2004, Kakwavu combined the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (FARDC) with his arms and his men, grouping his militia with the government. He was then promoted to the rank of general.
Kakwavu was arrested at the start of 2005, following pressure that ensued when the DRC was visited by a delegation of state ambassadors from the UN Security Council. He was then released on bail and continued in his role as general. It was the pressure from the American secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, during a visit to the DRC in 2009 that finally pushed the Congolese authorities to remand Kakwavu in custody in the central prison of Majala to await trial.
