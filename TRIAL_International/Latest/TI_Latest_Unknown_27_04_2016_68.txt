facts

Hyacinthe Nsengiyumva Rafiki was born in 1955 in Rubavu in the Gisenyi region in the north west of Rwanda. He was, in 1993, one of the influential leaders in the Social Democrat Party (SDP) and reportedly headed even the extremist wing called “Power”. Following this he became Cabinet Director to the Minister of Public Works, then Minister of Public Works in the interim Rwandan government of 1994. He was one of the founding members of the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (DFLR), established in 2001 and from which he was excluded in 2005 for “treason”.
Hyacinthe Nsengiyumva Rafiki is said to have wielded authority over the Interahamwe militias and the Impuzamugambi of Gisenyi. At the time he was nicknamed John Muhindo or Cyewusi (the dark one) and allegedly took part in meetings to prepare the genocide and then participate in its implementation from 1994 in the region of Gisenyi-Rubavu where he was born, notably with the attack against the church in Nyundo.
At the end of the genocide (which led to more than 800’000 deaths, mainly Tutsis), Rafiki reportedly fled to the Democratic Republic of Congo to take part in the creation of the DFLR. Later on he moved to France where he settled in the Val de Marne.
Hyacinthe Nsengiyumva Rafiki was part of a list drafted in 1996 in Rwanda by the Office of the Prosecutor in Kigali, of persons who were suspected of participation in the 1994 genocide. He was indicted for genocide, conspiracy to commit genocide, extermination and participation in an armed group and was under an Interpol arrest warrant issued by the Rwandan judicial authorities on 24 June 2008.
