facts

Mirko Pekez (a.k.a. Peka), son of Mile, was born on 31 May 1965 in the village of Čerkazovići, Municipality of Jajce. He served the military in 1968, in Slovenia. He is a plumber and single father of two kids.
During the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the armed conflict in the municipality of Jaice between the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS) and the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina and of the Croat Defense Counsel (HVO), Mirko Pekez and his co-defendants Mirko Pekez (son of Spiro) and Milorad Savic, were members of the VRS and of the reserve police force.
On 10 September 1992, as part of an organized group of armed people, Pekez went on collecting Bosniac civilians, located in Ljoljići and Čerkazovići, whose freedom of movement was limited since they had to respond to the roll call on a daily basis. The plan was to take them away and to kill them.
In execution of the plan, Mirko Pekez, Milorad Savic and Mirko Pekez (son of Spiro) went to agreed villages, and under the threat of using arms, unlawfully arrested and forcibly took out Bosniac civilians from their houses. Holding rifles in their hands, Mirko Pekez and the others threatened, insulted and physically harassed their prisoners. After the whole group reached a place called Draganovac, Pekez and his co-defendants ordered the prisoners to stop and to hand over all their valuable personal effects. Thereafter, the Bosniac civilians were ordered to line up against the edge of an abyss, and then the fire was opened.
Mirko Pekez (son of Mile), Milorad Savic and Mirko Pekez (son of Spiro) were arrested and have been held in custody since 1 November 2007. The Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina confirmed the indictment on 28 November 2007 and at the hearing of 11 December 2007 the accused pleaded not guilty.
