facts 

Antun Gudelj was born on 11 April 1947 in Tenja near Osijek, in the Eastern Croatian region of Slavonia. He emigrated to Australia where he obtained citizenship. After living there for several years Gudelj returned to Croatia and became a member of the Reserve Unit of the Police.
On 25 June 1991, Croatia proclaimed its independence from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Tensions started to rise between the new Croatian government and the Serbian minority. In Gudelj’s hometown, the local Serbs erected barricades to separate the Serbian town centre from the newer part of the village, mainly populated by Croats.
Josip Reihl-Kir (Reihl-Kir), head of the Osijek Police Department was known for his will to mediate between the Serbian minority and the Croatian authorities. On 1 July 1991, Reihl-Kir together with Goran Zobundžija and Milan Kneževiæ, both Serbian members of the Osijek Executive Council, went to Tenja to hold talks with the local Serbs. The goal was to reach an agreement on the removal of the barricades.
The negotiations had to be moved to Osijek. Accompanied by Mirko Tubiæ, president of the Tenja Local Community, the delegation started driving back to Osijek. At a checkpoint located in Nova Tenja, Antun Gudelj opened fire and killed three of the four men in the car. Mirko Tubiæ survived seriously injured. Gudelj committed these murders in the presence of several police officers that allowed him to escape.
By the time a detention order was issued, about a month later, the perpetrator had already left Croatia for Austria, from where he travelled to Australia.
The above-mentioned incident happened just prior to the escalation of the war in Croatia.
On 27 June 1994, while at large in Australia, Gudelj was tried in absentia by the Osijek County Court.
