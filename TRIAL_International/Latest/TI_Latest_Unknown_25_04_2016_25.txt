facts

Léon Mugesera was born in 1954 in Kibilira, Gisenyi Prefecture in Rwanda. His main occupation was lecturer at the National University of Rwanda, but he was also a political advisor to the MRND (National Republican Movement for Development and Democracy). Additionally, he served as Vice-President of the MRND in Gisenyi prefecture.
Léon Mugesera is accused of being one of the representatives of “Hutu Power” (linked with the MRND), an extremist Hutu movement founded by relatives of former president Juvenal Habyarimana, which claimed exclusive Hutu authority over a Rwanda purged of Tutsi.
On 22 November 1992, whilst he was Vice-President of the MRND in Gisenyi prefecture, Léon Mugesera gave a speech before 1,000 people in Kabaya in which he threatened that Tutsi would be forcefully returned to Ethiopia which, according to Hutu propaganda, is the country of origin of Tutsi.
Mugesera is considered to be one of the senior politicians responsible for planning the genocide.
The Rwandan authorities therefore issued an arrest warrant against him.
