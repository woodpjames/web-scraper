DRC: gathering evidence for the gravest crimes
09.10.2017
For the past three years, TRIAL International has been undertaking evidence-collection missions directly where serious crimes were committed. This action was based upon the two-fold observation that the time lapse between the commission of the crime and its prosecution played a role in the disappearance of pieces of evidence; and that the perpetrators of mass crimes were sometimes acquitted due to lack of evidence. To remedy that, there was only one solution: travelling to the crime scene, in remote and sometimes dangerous areas. Itâ€™s the price to pay to build a solid case.
The evidence we gather includes accounts from victims, medical records and certificates, testimonies from local authorities, pictures or even videos.
