Robert Pennington was born in 1984. He attended high school in Mukilteo in Washington State, leaving in 2002. Following the events of 11 September 2001 he enlisted in the Marine Corps of the U.S. military. As such, he made three trips to Iraq with his unit. The acts that follow were committed during his third posting as a soldier on the frontline.
On 26 April 2006 at approximately 2:00 am, a group of Marines went to Hamdania, a small village west of Baghdad, to perform a search. Pennington was the radio operator of the group. They went to the home of Hashim Awad Al Zobaï, a 52 year old father of 11 children. They seized him and bound his hands before forcing him to walk through the scene of an ambush that had occurred previously between the U.S. military and the Iraqi insurgents. There they bound his feet and Pennington forcefully pushed him into a crater that had been left by an explosive device. The marines then retreated and some shot at him whilst he was bound at the bottom of the hole while others fired into the air with a Kalashnikov that had been stolen previously to make it seem that a “battle royal” was taking place.
Once the man had died, the Marines scattered the bullet casings from the Kalashnikov around his body and placed the weapon at his side. Before leaving, the Marines also untied his feet and legs. Their objective was to make it look as though Hashim Awad had been caught trying to install a roadside IED, and that his death had resulted from a regular skirmish. The following day, local police found the body and asked neighbours to identify it.
