Károly Steiner, alias Charles Zentai, was born on 8 October 1921 in Hungary. He is a former soldier and officer in the Hungarian Army. After emigrating from Hungary in 1950 he settled in Australia and obtained Australian nationality in 1958. He is accused of war crimes committed during World War 2. Zentai is accused of having caught the 18 year old student Péter Balázs in a tramway in 1944, because he was not wearing the mandatory symbol used to identify Jews under the Nazi regime. He brought him to an army post, tortured him and left his body in the Danube River in Budapest.
Zentai was identified by the Simon Wiesenthal Centre during the operation “Last chance”. Evidence of Zentai’s crime was found in archives in Budapest. He was the last survivor involved in the crime. The Republic of Hungary sought the extradition of Mr. Zentai in order to prosecute him for war crimes, and he was placed in extradition custody in Australia in July 2005.
