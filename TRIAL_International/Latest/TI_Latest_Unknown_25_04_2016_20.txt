Fred Margus, born in 1961, is a former Croatian army commander accused of killing and harming Croatian-Serb civilians during the armed rebellion and armed conflicts in Croatia between 1992 and 1996.
During the time of the most serious attacks on Osijek and Eastern Croatia immediately after the fall of Vukovar, and the time of the most severe battles for Laslovo, Margus distinguished himself as a combatant, being recommended for promotion to the rank of lieutenant by the commander of the Third Battalion of the 106th Brigade of the Croatian Army. During this period, Margus killed two Serbian civilians and seriously injured a third. Moreover, he abducted, tortured, and killed five more civilians.
On 19 December 1991, the Osijek Police Department lodged a criminal complaint against Margus with the Osijek County Court, alleging the murder of several civilians committed by the former Croatian Army commander in 1991, in ÄŒepin. Between April 1993 and January 1996 the Osijek Military Prosecutor added several new counts and Margus was indicted before the Osijek County Court on charges of murder, inflicting grievous bodily harm, causing a risk to life and assets, and theft.
