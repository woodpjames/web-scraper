Anthony Sawoniuk, formerly Andrei Andreeovich Sawoniuk, was born in Domaczewo, Poland (now Damachava, Belarus), in 1921.
In June 1941, the German Army seized the town of Domaczewo. During the occupation, almost 3,000 Jewish inhabitants had their property seized and were forced into a ghetto. Sawoniuk volunteered to join the Nazi-supported Byelorussian Auxiliary Police and in the following three years he rose to the rank of commandant. Because of this role, Sawoniuk was involved in the murdering of Jews: several eyewitnesses testified of his personal involvement in the executions of at least 18 Jews, most of them women.
On 20 September 1942, eve of the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur, the Nazis gathered up the inhabitants of the ghetto, led them to the edge of town and executed them. It was one of the largest single-day massacres of the Holocaust. Following the massacre, Sawoniuk was given the task to organise “search and kill” teams to track down those who had escaped the slaughter.
In July 1944, when the Red Army counterattacked, Sawoniuk fled with the retreating Nazis and joined the 14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS. A few months later, in November 1944, he deserted from the SS and changed sides using his Polish birth certificate to join the 10th Hussar Regiment of the Polish II Corps in the British Eighth Army.
Sawoniuk arrived in Britain in 1945 posing as a Polish resistance fighter. He later became a British national. In the early 1950s Sawoniuk became a suspected war criminal by the KGB. In 1995 Scotland Yard, the London’s Metropolitan Police, started an inquiry into Sawoniuk’s case.
