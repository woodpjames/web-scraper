Ntumwa Maro, a warlord in the dock 
Marocain is suspected of being one of the highest-ranking leaders of a group that killed, terrorized and enslaved the people of Kalehe, in a series of attacks carried out between 2005 and 2007.
The Mai Mai group led by Marocain, which raided the territory of Kalehe, has committed the most serious crimes against civilians: looting, fire, rape, torture, murder, slavery, etc.
The group was extremely well organized. Villagers who were not killed during the attacks were sometimes taken to a group headquarters in the middle of the forest. There, the victims were enslaved, imprisoned, and tortured.
The group was known for its barbaric practices: it tortured its prisoners and left them for dead, tied to a tree for days. They threw people into a pit called “ANDAKI” where they were tortured and subjected to degrading treatment…
Women and girls in particular were taken prisoner and reduced to sexual slavery. Some of them were also forced to take “husbands”. The situation lasted up to a year and a half for some.
“I was taken hostage by soldiers who gave me to one of them to become his wife. I was also tortured in a hole called ‘Andake’, says a victim who wishes to stay anonymous.
