Jovan Cico was a member of the Territorial Defence Forces of the Yugoslav Republic in the Vukovar region in Croatia.
He is accused of having participated in the killings, torture and robbery of non-Serbian civilians living in the village Miklusevci.
On 18 May 1992 Jovan Cico and other members of the Territorial Defence Forces forced the 98 residents of the village of Miklusevci to leave their homes by throwing explosives and threatening them with firearms. They then proceeded to stealing their money, jewellery and other valuable possessions. According to the victimsâ€™ testimonies, four persons were killed and six other were tortured and beaten. These acts were performed on behalf of the illegal government of the Serb Autonomous Region of Krajina with the objective of expelling the non-Serbian population from the territory.
