No, Mr. Trump: torture can never be legal

An op-ed by Philip Grant 
President Trump’s support for torture goes against everything TRIAL International fights for. 
In a recent television interview, the new President of the United States (US) unambiguously defended the use of torture against suspected terrorists. Referring to ISIS atrocities, he argued that “we have to fight fire with fire”, concluding that waterboarding – a torture method simulating drowning – was instrumental to making the US safer.
Mr. Trump’s bid to keep torture “within the bounds of what you’re allowed to do legally” is all but a trickery: torture is never legal – and has not been for a long time.
