facts 

Sabawi Ibrahim Hasan al-Tikriti was born in around 1945. No details of his education or family history are available. He was was one of Saddam Hussein’s three maternal step-brothers, the others being Barzan Ibrahim al-Hasan al-Tikriti and Watban Ibrahim al-Tikriti.
Sabawi Ibrahim Hasan Al-Tikriti was head of the Iraqi secret service (the Mukhabarat) during the 1991 Gulf War. Subsequently, he was head of the Directorate of General Security from 1991 to 1995 and from 1996 a key presidential advisor to Saddam Hussein. In 2003 he took refuge in Syria. From there he is alleged to have organised and financed insurgents within Iraq after the ousting of Saddam Hussein.
The United States offered a $1 million reward for his capture, and had featured Sabawi Ibrahim Hasan Al-Tikriti as the “six of diamonds” in the Pentagon’s deck of cards identifying the most-wanted members of the Ba’athist government. He was also number 36 on the list of 55 most-wanted Iraqis released by U.S. authorities after troops invaded Iraq in March 2003.
On 14 February 2005, just hours after the assassination of Lebanese prime minister Rafiq Hariri, Sabawi Ibrahim was captured by the Syrians at his base in the northeastern Syrian town of Hasakah. The Syrians apparently accused Sabawi Ibrahim of involvement in the Hariri assassination and a nightclub bombing in Tel Aviv. Under extreme pressure, the Syrians handed Sabawi Ibrahim over to US forces on 27 February 2005, who handed him over to the interim Iraqi government. “The capture appeared to be a goodwill gesture by the Syrians to show that they are cooperating,” an Iraqi official said, according to the Associated Press.
