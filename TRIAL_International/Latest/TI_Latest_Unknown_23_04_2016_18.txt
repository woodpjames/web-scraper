Jeremy Morlock, a 22 year-old, from Wasilla, Alaska, was serving as a Specialist in B Company, 2nd Battalion, 1st Infantry Regiment, 5th Stryker Brigade, operating near Kandahar in Southern Afghanistan during 2009 and 2010, in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.
Mr. Morlock is one of the twelve US soldiers accused of being part of a team that, in early 2010, in the Afghan region where they were operating, randomly murdered unarmed civilians. Mr. Morlock and five other soldiers are accused of murder civilians in unprovoked assaults allegedly throwing grenades and opening fire on them, while the other seven soldiers are accused of dismembering the victims and collecting body parts.
All of the components of the team are accused of using hashish and staging the killings to make the unarmed Afghan civilians look like they were enemy combatants who forced the soldiers to kill them to repeal Taliban attacks.
On 23 March 2011, in a court-martial proceeding hold before the Joint Base Lewis-McChord military tribunal, Jeremy Morlock pleaded guilty to three counts of murder and one count of conspiracy, obstruction of justice, and illegal drug use.
