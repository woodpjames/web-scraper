Facts

Milan Bojanic was a member of the Territorial Defence Forces of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the Vukovar region in Croatia. This military unit, together with the Yugoslav Peopleâ€™s Army, fought against the forces of the Republic of Croatia on behalf of the Serbian minority which was seeking to secede from the Republic of Croatia between August 1991 and May 1992.
Allegedly, Bojanic participated in killings, torture and robbery of non-Serbs living in the village of Miklusevci which had fallen into the hands of the Serb forces.
He has been accused of forcing 98 residents to leave the village on 18 May 1992 by throwing bombs into the houses and threatening them with firearms, while at the same time they were robbed of their money, jewellery and other valuables. According to the allegations, four persons were killed and six were tortured.
