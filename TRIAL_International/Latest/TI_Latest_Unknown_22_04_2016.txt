Vladimir Milankovic was the Police Commander in the Sisak and Banovina regions of Croatia during the conflict in the former Yugoslavia. He took an active part in the hostilities which arose between Serbs and Croats during the period 1991 to 1992.
The facts which led to the conviction of Milankovic covered the period from July 1991 to July 1992 during which time he was Commander of Police. In this capacity Milankovic did not fulfill his duty to protect the civilian population of Sisak and Banovina. Indeed neither did he act nor did he take sufficient measures to prevent the commission of numerous illegal activities perpetrated against Serb civilians. These acts included breach of domicile, acts of humiliation and intimidation in addition to physical and moral harassment.
Furthermore, he abused his authority as Police Commander to prevent any attempt aimed at identifying and punishing the authors of these unlawful acts. In doing so, he approved methods adopted by his subordinates and even encouraged them to act in the way they did. Finally, he also took decisions concerning the unlawful arrest and prolonged imprisonment of several Serb civilians.
According to the indictment, the illegal activities which were committed by Milankovic in person or tolerated by him in his position as Police Commander of Sisak and Banovina regions, led to the death of 24 Serb civilians between July 1991 and July 1992.
