facts

Milomir Stakic was born on 19 January 1962 in Maricka, Prijedor, Bosnia Herzegovina. He studied medicine at the University of Banja Luka and practiced initially in Teslic and later in a clinic in Omarska and then in A&E serving the villages of Lamovita and Kevliani.
Before the election in November 1990, Milomir Stakic was part of the establishment of a local branch of the radical people’s party ‘Nikola Pasic’. He was the president of this party for the region of Omarska. This branch from Omarska joined forces with the Serbian Democratic Party (SDS) establishing a coalition. Stakic was elected the vice-president of the SDS for the Prijedor municipality on 11 September 1991.
Between 29 and 30 April 1992, the SDS seized power in Prijedor using violence to overthrow legitimate central authorities replacing them with members of the SDS. Milomir Stakic replaced Muhamen Cehajic, who was the then elected preseident of the municipal assembly.
Immediately after the overthrow, the crisis squad of the SDS imposed severe restrictions on non-Serbians, primarily against the Muslim and Croat population of Bosnia. At the beginning of May 1992, the areas that were inhabited by Muslims and Croats were attacked by Serbian authorities on a large scale. Milomir Stakic organised and supported the deportation of more than 20,000 non-Serbs living in the Prijedor municipality. A large proportion of Muslims and Croats who had survived the attack were arrested and locked up in various prisons in the Prijedor area. These prisons were established and managed by the SDS (e.g. camps of Omarska, Keraterm and Trnopolje).
Milomir Stakic was involved in the management of these prisons. On 5 August 1992, on his command, 120 men were executed in the Keraterm camp. Furthermore, he was responsible for the execution of around 200 people in Korieanske Stijene on 21 August 1992. The hygiene conditions of these camps were precarious and inadequate and the prisoners received just enough food to survive. They were mistreated and tortured. The women were victims of sexual violence and were raped.
It is estimated that Stakic is responsible for the execution of more than 1,500 people in a period spanning 30 April 1992 until 30 September 1992.
After the passing of an international arrest warrant on 22 January 2001, Milomir Stakic was arrested on 23 March 2001 in Belgrade and handed over to the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY).
