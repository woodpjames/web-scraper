facts

Dragomir Soldat was a police officer in the 43rd Motorised Brigade of the Bosnian Serb Army during the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
During a widespread and systematic attack launched against the non-Serb civilian population of the municipality of Prijedor, in the Republika Srpska, Soldat ordered on 23 July 1992 the killing of all men living in the village of Carakovo, located in that same municipality.
This order was carried out by a group of men under his command, including Velemir Djuric and Zoran Babic, the Deputy Chief of the Public Security Center in Prijedor. Consequently, ten Bosnian civilians residing in the village were taken from their houses, escorted to the local mosque, and shot there. The mosque was then set on fire, thus killing the few wounded civilians who managed to survive to the shooting.
On 4 December 2012, upon the order of the Prosecution of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Soldat and Djuric were arrested in Prijedor, and remanded in custody, as they represented a high flight risk.
