Tomislav Merčep was born on 28 September 1952 in Vukovar.
Before joining the Croatian Democratic Union in 1990 (HDZ), he worked as a civil engineer. In 1991, he became the commander of the reserve police unit. In August 1991, he became advisor to the Minister of Internal Affairs.
From January until August 1991, attacks were launched by paramilitary and police forces of Vukovar against the Serbian civilian population in the territory of the Vukovar Municipality.
Merčep is allegedly responsible for ordering those attacks on the Serbian population. He is allegedly responsible for the explosion of the houses of the Serbian population in Vukovar. Moreover, Merčep is allegedly responsible for ordering the unlawful arrest, torture, disappearance and murder of Serbian civilians during the summer of 1991.
An alleged perpetrator, Miro Bajramovic, member of Merčep’s unit admitted to killing 72 people himself. Bajramovic also alleged that Merčep ordered his units to kill and torture civilians and to steal their property. During Merčep’s alleged campaign of terror, it is estimated that 13’734 Serbs fled Vukovar.
In early August 1991, Merčep was briefly detained with fifteen of his men. Shortly afterwards, as the war broke out, he was released. He was then promoted to the post of advisor to the minister of internal affairs. Under this role, he is suspected of having created and commanded a unit responsible for the torture, rape and murder of Serbs and Croats in the Prakac region. He is also allegedly responsible for ordering the plunder of Croatian and Serbian belongings.
In September 2005, five members of Merčep’s unit were convicted by the Zagreb County Court for crimes committed in the region.
