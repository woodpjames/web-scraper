01.04.2012
In April 2012, TRIAL and 9 local associations working with former camp detainees from all sides, submitted a report (called ‘general allegation’ in the UN jargon) to the Special Rapporteur on Torture and other Cruel, Inhumane and Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention in order to highlight the remaining obstacles preventing Bosnia and Herzegovina’s full implementation of international obligations in regards to the issue of former camp detainees.
