facts 

Kurt Christmann was born on 1 June 1907 in Munich, Germany. He was the son of an administrative inspector. In 1920 Christmann became a member of “SA-Sturm Klintsch” and two years later, in 1922, he became a member of “Jungsturm Adolf Hitler”. In 1923 he participated in the Hitler putsch (8 – 9 November 1923 in Munich, Germany).
Christmann joined the SS and the Nazi party NSDAP in 1933. The following year, in 1934, he obtained a PhD in law (Dr. iur.). Kurt Christmann was a successful athlete. He won the German championship in canoeing as well as the German police skiing championship. Due to his athletic activities he became head of division for winter sports in the SS. In 1938 Christmann was sent to work with the Gestapo in Vienna, Austria. Later on he was sent to Innsbruck and from 1939 until 1942 he was Gestapo leader of the Austrian town of Salzburg.
From August 1942 onwards he held a post as leader of the Einsatzkommando 10a in the Russian town of Krasnodar, which was occupied by German forces from August 1942 until February 1943. During the time of the occupation he participated in committing war crimes, notably the killing of partisans and their relatives, amongst them children, using a gas wagon. He was also involved in the killing of suspected partisans and communists.
Thereafter Christmann was Gestapo leader in Klagenfurt, Austria, and Koblenz, Germany, until he was promoted to SS-Obersturmbannführer in 1942.
After World War II, Kurt Christmann was captured and held at the detention center in Dachau. However, he managed to escape in 1946. Christmann then worked under the name Dr. Ronda for the British occupying power, but soon afterwards fled via Rome to Argentina. There he was involved in the Kameradenwerk, an organization supporting Nazis who fled from Europe, many of whom had committed war crimes.
In 1956 Kurt Christmann returned to Germany. He was not allowed to register and practice as a lawyer, so he launched into the real estate business and was soon running his own real estate company.
On 19 December 1980, after eight years of delaying the trial due to Christmann’s ill health, the district court of Munich, Germany, condemned him to 10 years imprisonment for his participation in the war crimes committed in Krasnodar.
