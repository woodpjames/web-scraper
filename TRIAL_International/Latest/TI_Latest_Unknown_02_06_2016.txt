facts

Josip Tolic was born in 1968 in the village of Bijele Bate, close to Odzak, in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
Tolic is a former member of the 102nd Odzac Brigade of the Croatian Defense Council. He was indicted for his supposed participation, during May and October 1992, in the inhumane treatment inflicted upon Serb prisoners detained illegally in a primary school and a factory in the region of Odzak, as well as in other similar illegal detention centers in the Bosanski Brod area.
Eye witnesses and victims reported that Tolic, together with other members of the Croatian Defense Council, beat up, raped and inflicted other kinds of ill treatment, contrary to the legal rights of prisoners on numerous Serb detainees, both men and women, in prisons in Odzak and Bosanski Brod. Some of these detainees were also forced into work. Several prisoners died as a result of their stay in prison, either due to the ill treatment they were subjected to or through a lack of nourishment during their imprisonment.
The International Committee of the Red Cross visited the prisons in question and collected testimony from several victims, and such testimony has been presented during Tolicâ€™s trial.
