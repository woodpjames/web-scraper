facts

Yves Mandro Kahwa Panga was born on 20 August 1973 in Bunia, the regional capital of Ituri, in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). He was a former member of the Union of Congolese Patriots (UPC) of Thomas Lubanga (see “related cases”), and on 14 February 2003, founded the Party for Unity and Safeguarding of the Integrity of Congo (French acronym PUSIC).
PUSIC was actively backed by the Ugandan authorities within the framework of the FIPI (Front for Integration and Peace in Ituri-a coalition of PUSIC, the Front for National Integration led by Floribert Njabu Ngabu and the Popular Force for Democracy in Congo of Thomas Unen Chen). These groups controlled a large part of the North and the North-East of the DRC, especially the zones in the Nord-Kivu province, those of Ituri and major parts of the Province Orientale and that of the Province of Equateur.
Despite the signature, on 16 May 2003, of the Dar es-Salaam Ceasefire Agreement between the Front for Integration and Peace in Ituri, the Congolese Government and the five rebel factions in Ituri, confrontations still continued as much in Bunia as in Tchomia as well as in other locations in Ituri.
According to the allegations brought against Mandro Kahwa Panga, his party was allegedly responsible for the destabilisation of the district of Ituri. Furthermore, by setting fire to the medical centre and to schools and churches in the districts of Zumbe and Bedu Ezekere between 15 and 16 October 2002, Mandro Kahwa Panga, was accused of being responsible for the death of at least 10 persons.
Mandro Kahwa Panga was arrested on 9 April 2005.
