Ivan Kalymon was born on 22 January 1921 in Ukraine. When he was 18 years old, he moved to Vienna where he worked on various farms. Following this, he worked in Hanover for two years before returning to Lviv, in Ukraine. The town of Lviv, originally known as Lvov, belonged to Poland until it was occupied by Nazi Germany in 1939 then, in accordance with the German-Soviet pact, by the Red Army from 17 September 1939. The region was then annexed by the Soviet Union and incorporated into the Soviet Socialist Republic of Ukraine based on a secret clause of the German-Soviet Pact.
During the period of the alleged facts with which he was charged and up until 1944, Kalymon was a volunteer in the 5th Commissariat of the Ukrainian Auxiliary Police based in Lviv. The Ukrainian Auxiliary Police, created by Heinrich Himmler in mid-August 1941, was thereby controlled by the Nazis from 1941 onwards. During the German occupation, the Jewish population of Lviv went from 100’000 to 200’000 people, making it one of the largest Jewish ghettos created by the Nazis in this former Polish region. Between 1942 and 1943, more than 100’000 Jews in Lviv were said to have lost their lives in part due to the actions of the Ukrainian Auxiliary Police.
Kalymon reportedly participated in the capture and murder of Jews as well as in their deportation to forced labor camps or mass execution sites, during his service in the Ukrainian Auxiliary Police.
On 14 August 1942, Kalymon was alleged to have submitted a report to his superiors in which he described how he had murdered a Jew and injured another during the “Jewish Operation” on that same day. One of his commanders was also reported to have written reports according to which Kalymon used his firearm during the police raids on the Jews.
In 1949, Kalymon reportedly concealed his past service in the Ukrainian Auxiliary Police in order to be able to emigrate from Germany to the United States. He worked there as an automobile engineer in the State of Michigan and obtained United States nationality in 1955.
The United States government learned about Kalymon’s past in 1991, when the archives from the Second World War had become accessible. These archives, revealed the identity of those persons who had hidden their allegiance to the Axis powers when emigrating to the United States.
In 2004, the United States Department of Justice initiated proceedings against him before the Detroit District Court of the United States, to obtain that his American citizenship be revoked.
