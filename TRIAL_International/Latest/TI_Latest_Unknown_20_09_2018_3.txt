Enforced disappearance and torture due to political activism
20.09.2018
In April 2015 in Burundi, many people took to the streets to demonstrate against the renewal of President Pierre Nkurunzizaâ€™s mandate.
A few months later, unidentified armed men carried out attacks on several military camps. These attacks, considered as a turning point in the Burundian crisis, triggered a repressive campaign of unprecedented scale in several opposition-affiliated neighborhoods.
In this context, Sam (real name withheld), an opposition member involved in the anti-third-term protests, was violently arrested by a group of police officers. After being beaten up and harshly interrogated, Sam was forcibly taken into a police van.
Sam was seen one last time after his abduction, tied up in a police vehicle. He was covered in blood and the marks of the abuse that had suffered were still visible.
