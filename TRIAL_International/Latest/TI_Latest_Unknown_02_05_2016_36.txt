facts

Erich Raeder was born on 24 April 1876 in Wandsbek close to Hamburg. He joined the Imperial Navy, following his secondary school studies, in 1894. During the First World War he took part in the famous Battle of Jutland. After the war, he continued to climb the ranks in the navy to the position of Admiral, and won overall command of the German fleet in October 1928. He was initially against the Nazi Party, but was won over to Hitler in 1933 when the latter initiated the programme of German rearmament. Raeder was at that time given the task of rearming the “Kriegsmarine” (German naval forces).
In 1939, he was promoted to the position of “High-Admiral”. Some time later, he suggested to Hitler that he should invade Denmark and Norway to ensure supplies of Swedish steel, a suggestion which was enacted in 1940. At a later stage, he became opposed to certain of Hitler’s strategic plans, notably his decision to invade the USSR. Following a series of defeats encountered by the German surface fleet, he resigned from his position on 6 January 1943.
Erich Raeder was accused of having used his rank in the military hierarchy and his personal influence in such a manner that: he promoted the preparations for war as set forth in count 1 of the Indictment; he participated in the political planning and preparation of the Nazi conspirators for wars of aggression and wars in violation of international treaties, agreements and assurances as set fort in count 1 and count 2 of the Indictment; he executed, and assumed responsibility for the execution of the plans of the Nazi conspirators for wars of aggression and wars in violation of international treaties agreements and assurances as set forth in count 1 and 2 of the Indictment; and he authorized, directed and participated in the war crimes as set forth in count 3 of the Indictment, including particularly war crimes arising out of sea warfare.
Erich Raeder was arrested by the Soviets at the end of the war.
