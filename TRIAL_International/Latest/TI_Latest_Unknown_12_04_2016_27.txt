facts 

The Democratic Republic of Congo suffered from an armed conflict between 1998 and 2003 which has essentially not ceased in the eastern part of the country. The number of deaths is estimated in millions in the conflict between several armed groups backed by Angola, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Uganda and Rwanda.
Blaise Bongi Massaba was captain of the 3rd company of the 1st Battalion of the 4th Brigade of the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Congo. He was deployed in the eastern provinces, namely Ituri where he was mandated to patrol and to secure a certain area in order to suppress militia activity.
On 12 October 2005, he and soldiers under his command arrested five boys, most of whom were students. They then went to Tchekele, a town in the area Bongi Massaba was assigned to, where he stole a motorcycle, a radio, a motorized pump, and solar panels. The boys were forced to transport the goods to Massabaâ€™s command post. Yet, it is claimed that when the boys did that, he ordered the other soldiers to kill them arguing that they were militia members.
On 25 October 2005, the parents of the victims started looking for their children only to find them dead in a common grave on Mount AWI.
The trial against Blaise Bongi Massala opened on 9 March 2006 at the Military Tribunal of Ituri.
