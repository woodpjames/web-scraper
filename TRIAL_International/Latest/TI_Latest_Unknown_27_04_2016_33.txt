facts

Jean-Marie Vianney Ndahimana, also known as Rumende, was a Colonel of the former Rwandan Armed Forces (FAR). The FAR, alongside with the pro-Hutu militia known as Interahamwe, had a primary role in the organization and in the perpetration of the Tutsis massacres in 1994.
During the genocide Ndahimana was one of the senior military officers serving at the military compound of Camp Kigali, where ten Belgian peacekeepers of the UNAMIR mission were tortured and then executed at the outset of the massacres.
Reportedly Ndahimana played a role in the killings that took place both around Kigali and in his home Prefecture, in Kibuye. He is also suspected of having ordered the extermination of more than 5000 Tutsis in the former Bwakira Commune.
Following investigations carried out in Rwanda by Belgian prosecutors, Ndahimana was arrested in late March 2011 in Belgium, where he had fled after the genocide.
