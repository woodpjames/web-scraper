Sahit Jashari is Albanian from Kosovo (in the Former Yugoslavia). According to the indictment against him, he was a member of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), created to fight against Serbian forces operating in the Kosovo area.
The EU rule-of-law mission to Kosovo, EULEX, is prosecuting 15 former Kosovo Liberation Army fighters for alleged war crimes against civilian detainees.
Jashari is, alongside fourteen other men, accused of war crimes, deprivation of liberty and torture. Furthermore, Jashari and Sabit Geci (another member of KLA) are charged with physical abuse and the murder of Serbian policeman Ivan Bulatovic in a KLA prison in Likovac village of Drenica (in the central area of the Republic of Kosovo) in 1998.
According to evidence from the Serbian War Crimes Prosecutorâ€™s Office, including footage from the detention camp in Likovac which was made by KLA members in May 1998, the Drenica Group abducted at least 30 Serbs and 11 ethnic Albanian civilians, as well as several policemen, in attacks on villages and towns.
On 6 December 2013, during a plea hearing before the First instance court in Mitrovica, Jashari pleaded not guilty.
