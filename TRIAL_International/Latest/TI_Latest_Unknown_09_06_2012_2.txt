facts

Momir Talic was born on 15 July 1942 in Piskavica in Bosnia and Herzegovina. He joined the Yugoslav Peoples Army (JNA) on 25 July 1961 as a professional military officer with a specialisation in armoured-mechanised units.
According to the indictment, Momir Talic was posted to the JNA 5th Corps in Banja Luka on 26 July 1991 as Chief of Staff/Deputy Commander of the Corps. On 19 March 1992, Momir Talic became the Commander of the JNA 5th Corps/1st Krajina Corps, with the authority to direct and control the actions of all forces assigned to the JNA 5th Corps/1st Krajina Corps or under its control. All plans for military engagement and attack had to be approved by him before any forces were committed to battle or other operations.
According to the Indictment, Momir Talic was also a member of the crisis cell of the Autonomous Region of Krajina (“ARK”). Together with Radoslav Brdjanin he implemented the policy of incorporating the “ARK” into a Serb State. The implementation of that policy required the permanent removal of the Bosnian Muslim and Bosnian Croat people, and the destruction of their culture in those municipalities where they had lived for centuries.
Momir Talic was arrested in Austria on 25 August 1999 and was transferred on the same day to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in The Hague.
