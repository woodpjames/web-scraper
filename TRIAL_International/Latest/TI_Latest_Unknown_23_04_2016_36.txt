Nebojša Minić was born on 1 March 1964 in Rosulje, near Peć.
During his life, he was known to be a criminal, associated with drug-dealing in Kosovo. He is also associated with crimes committed in Bosnian war.
Nebojša Minić was a former member of the Serbian Volunteer Guard, a paramilitary unit led by Željko Ražnatović Arkan.
Minić was the commander of a paramilitary group “Lightning” (“Munje”), which was created in the beginning of 1998 in Kosovo, to help the Special Police Unit already existing and fighting Kosovo Liberation Army, and a member of “Group 77”, a paramilitary group which operated in Peć in 1999.
He was also the commander of the so-called “Jackals” during the international armed conflict in Kosovo which lasted from 24 March 1999 until 20 June 1999.
After 24 March 1999, the 177th brigade was mobilised. Toplica Miladinović was in charge of the brigade, while Minić, who was allegedly under Miladinović’s direct command, was in charge of one platoon in the brigade. Since Minić was known as “Jackal-1”, his whole platoon became known as the “Jackals”.
The Jackal fighters were first considered paramilitaries, but they were all members of the Yugoslav army, with military identification, and they all received salaries from the army.
The four villages of Ljubetić, Pavlan, Zahač and Ćuška in the vicinity of Peć, which were mostly populated by Albanian populations, were attacked in April and May 1999.
Minić, allegedly under direct orders from Miladinović, led the said attacks.
After the International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia located Minić in Mendoza, Argentina, he was arrested in May 2005 .
