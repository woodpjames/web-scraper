facts


Niset Ramić was a member of a sabotage unit in the Second Department of the Territorial Defence Municipal Staff, in the municipality of Visoko, Bosnia Herzegovina, at the start of the 1990s during the Former Yugoslavian conflict.
Ramić allegedly committed a number of crimes in Bosnia Herzegovina, in Slovenia, and also in Former Yugoslavia, notably, electoral fraud and variations of aggravated theft, burglary, and murders.
On 20 June 1992, Ramić supposedly travelled to the village of Hlapčevići in the municipality of Viisoko in Bosnia Herzegovina, as part of an operation called “disarming”.
Once he arrived, he allegedly ordered a group of around eight soldiers who were under his control to surround three houses inhabited by Serbian people. Ramić and his soldiers then reportedly forced six Serbian people from their homes, and ordered them to the Youth Centre of Hlapčevići. As the captured civilians were on their way to the centre, Ramić allegedly made them stop, and stand against the wall of a house. Then, he reportedly ordered one of them to indicate where weapons and mines had been hidden in Hlapčevići, according to his information. As the person being interrogated did not answer, Ramić allegedly shot him with an automatic weapon, before opening fire on the other captured civilians, and repeated this act after they had fallen to the ground.
Four Serbian civilians were killed, and two others were grievously injured by Ramić. These acts constituted violations of international humanitarian law as provided by the Geneva Conventions, particularly violations of articles 3 (1) a) and 31 of the Fourth Geneva Convention (IV) of 1949 relating to the protection of civilians in times of war. Ramić allegedly committed a war crime against civilians, violating articles 173 (1) a) and c), and 180 (1) of the Bosnian – Herzegovinian penal code.
