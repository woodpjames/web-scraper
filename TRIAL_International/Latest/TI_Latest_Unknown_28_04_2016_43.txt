Saleh Mohammed Jerbo Jamus (“Jerbo”) was born in the village of Shagag Karo in North Darfur on 1 January 1977. He is a member of the Zaghawa tribe of Sudan. He is currently a member of the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM).
On 29 September 2007, an attack against the African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) was carried out by splinter forces of the JEM, together with troops belonging to the Sudanese Liberation Army-Unity (SLA-Unity), which had broken away from the Sudanese Liberation Movement/Army (SLM/A). The AMIS was a peace-keeping mission stationed at the Haskanita Military Group Site (MGS Haskanita) in the locality of Umm Kadada in North Darfur, Sudan.
Allegedly, the approximately 1,000 attackers, who were armed with anti-aircraft guns, artillery guns and rocket-propelled grenade launchers, killed 12 AMIS soldiers and severely wounded eight others. In addition, they allegedly destroyed communication facilities, vehicles, computers and other goods which belonged to the AMIS.
Jerbo was allegedly in command of the Chief-of-Staff of the Sudan Liberation Army-Unity (SLA-Unity) during this attack. The Pre-Trial Chamber I of the ICC considers there are sufficient grounds to believe there was a non-international armed conflict in Dafur between the Government of Sudan and several organized armed groups, including the JEM and the SLM/A.
The ICC Pre-Trial Chamber I issued Jerbo a summons to appear on 27 August 2009 for war crimes allegedly committed during the attack of 29 September 2007 against the AMIS.
