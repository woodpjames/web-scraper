Aleksa Golijanin, also known as “Aca”, was born 17 December 1962 in Goražde, Bosnia and Herzegovina.
He was a Deputy Platoon Commander of the Jahorina Training Center of the Special Police Brigade within the Republika Srpska Ministry of Interior. During the armed conflict in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1995, the Army of Republika Srpska and the Ministry of Interior of Republika Srpska carried out a widespread and systematic attack (now referred to as the Srebrenica Genocide) against the Bosniak civilian population from the United Nations safe area of Srebrenica. In the period of 10 to 19 July 1995 Golijanin was allegedly involved in the Srebrenica genocide.
The Prosecutor of the Special Department for War Crimes within the Prosecutor’s Office of Bosnia and Herzegovina issued an indictment against Golijanin, charging him with the following:
– to have, on 12 July 1995, been responsible as Deputy Commander for the 3rd Platoon whose members, armed with automatic weapons, took part in the search of Bosniak houses with the aim of gathering the Bosniak population to be taken to the collection centre in Potočari;
– to have, on 12 and 13 July 1995, participated together with other members of the 1st Company in the forcible relocation of civilians from the United Nation base in Potočari, via buses and trucks, to the area under the control of the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina;
– to have, on 12 and 13 July 1995, as Deputy Platoon Commander, along with other members of Companies I and II of the Jahorina Training Centre and members of other Army of Republika Srpska and Republika Srpska Ministry of Interior units, participated in capturing thousands of Bosniak men. The accused ordered members of the Training Center to execute fifteen to twenty captured Bosniak men on a meadow beside the Konjević Polje-Bratunac road. He also participated in these killings;
– to have on 17 and 18 July 1995, together with other members of Companies I and II and members of the Army of Republika Srpska Bratunac Brigade, participated in the search of a forest area located above the Bratunac – Konjević Polje road, with the goal of locating, capturing and killing Bosniak men. At least four Bosniak men were killed at that time. One of them was executed by Aleksa Golijanin on the orders of his superior, where he fired from close range from an automatic rifle. Hundreds of Bosniak men, among whom were children, were captured and then taken to a warehouse at the intersection of Konjević Polje, where they were imprisoned, and then killed.
On 19 July 2012 the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina confirmed the indictment under which the accused Golijanin is charged with the criminal offense of genocide in violation of Article 171(a)(b) of the Criminal Code of Bosnia and Herzegovina (CC BiH) in conjunction with Article 180(1) of Criminal Code of Bosnia and Herzegovina (individual criminal responsibility).
