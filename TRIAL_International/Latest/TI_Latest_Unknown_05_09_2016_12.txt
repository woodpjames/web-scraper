Facts

César Augusto Ruiz Morales is an ex-army major in the artillery and was an operations officer at Military Zone 21 – a former military base in Cobán, Alta Verapaz – between 1 July 1986 and 31 March 1987, during Guatemala’s civil war. He was 65 years old at the time of his arrest.
During the 1980s, Military Zone 21 was used by the Guatemalan military as a secret center for illegal detentions, torture, extrajudicial killings, forced disappearance, and rape. In 2012, mass graves containing hundreds of bodies of indigenous men, women, and children from different Mayan ethnic groups – including Achí, Q’eqchi’, Pomochí, Ixil, and Kiché – were uncovered at Military Zone 21, which is now the site of a training center for U.N. peacekeepers known by the Spanish acronym CREOMPAZ. Over 550 skeletons have been exhumed, and at least 128 of the victims have been identified using DNA testing.
On 6 January 2016, Guatemalan authorities arrested 14 former high-ranking military officers in connection with the CREOMPAZ case for crimes committed at Military Zone 21 between 1981 and 1988.
