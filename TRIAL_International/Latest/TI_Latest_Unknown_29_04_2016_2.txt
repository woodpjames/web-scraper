facts

Hissène Habré was born on 13 September 1942 in northern Chad. He is a member of the Anakaza branch of the Daza ethnic group, which is itself a branch of the Toubou ethnic group. He ruled Chad from 1982 until his ouster by the current President Idriss Déby in December 1990, following which he fled to Senegal.
Habré’s one party regime was marked by widespread violations of human rights and mass campaigns of violence against the civilian population. Habré was said to undertake persecutions by making collective arrests and committing mass murders against different ethnic groups, especially when he perceived their leaders as being a threat to his regime. This was particularly true of the Sara and other groups from the South (in 1984), the Hadjaraï (in 1987) and the Zaghawa (in 1989). Furthermore, during the whole period between 1983 and 1990, many were detained in secret detention centres, where they were tortured and subjected to inhumane treatment. Many died while in detention.
The exact number of Habré’s victims remains unknown to this day. In May 1992, the national Commission of Inquiry, established by Déby in 1990, accused the Habré government of 40’000 politically motivated murders and systematic torture. The greater part of these abuses was carried out by Habré’s dreaded political police, the Documentation and Security Directorate (DDS), whose directors, all pertaining to Habré’s own ethnic group (the Goranes), reported directly to him.
On 26 January 2000, seven Chadian victims and one association (the AVCRP, Association of the Victims of Crimes and Political Repression in Chad) file a complaint against Habré before the regional tribunal of Dakar.
