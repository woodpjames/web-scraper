facts

Driss Basri was born on 8 November 1938 in Settat, Morocco. He was a Moroccan politician who served as Interior Minister from 1979 to 1999. In 1983, Driss Basri became the right-hand man of King Hassan II and the number two of the regime until its end in the 1990s.
His name has been associated with the “Years of Lead”, a period in Morocco between the 1960s until the early 1990s under the rule of King Hassan II that was characterized by the suppression of opposition: dissidents were arrested, executed or “disappeared”, newspapers were closed and books were banned. It is believed that there were hundreds of killings and enforced disappearances for political motives. Further it is believed that arbitrary arrests and torture affected many, including some of those outside the opposition networks.
Driss Basri is accused of being responsible for an event that took place in the year of 1984. It is alleged that Mohamed el-Battiui, who was at that time a member of the Moroccan Student’s Union, was imprisoned on no grounds. During his 20 day-long custody, he was allegedly tortured several times a day. He then was convicted to three more months’ imprisonment for breach of the public peace.
After King Mohammed VI rose to the throne in 1999, succeeding Hassan II, Driss Basri was discharged from his ministerial functions on 9 November 1999. He went to live in Paris where he died on 27 August 2007.
