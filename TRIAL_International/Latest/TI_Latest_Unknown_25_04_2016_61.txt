facts

Mitar Vasiljevic was born on 25 August 1954 in Djurevici, in the Visegrad region of Bosnia and Herzegovina. He worked as a waiter for the company “Panos”; the owner of numerous restaurants and cafés in the Visegrad area.
Following the election of a new local council in November 1990, ethnic tensions between the Serb minority and the Muslim majority escalated. This was due to the fact that Serbs accounted for one third of the council; the remainder being composed of non-Serb Muslims.
At the start of 1992, Serb forces attacked and took control of Visegrad. A systematic, large-scale campaign of murder, rape and mistreatment of the region’s non-Serb population, particularly Muslims, then ensued.
Mitar Vasiljevic was a member of the paramilitary group known as the “White Eagles”, or the “upholders of the law”, that worked with the police and a range of military groups stationed in Visegrad. On 7 June 1992, Mitar Vasiljevic, Milan Lukic, Sredoje Lukic, and others who remain unidentified, took seven Muslims from Bosnia to the River Drina. The Muslims were made to face the river before the group opened fire on them; five out of the seven were found dead following the shooting, two escaped without serious injuries.
On 14 June 1992, Mitar Vasiljevic locked Bosnian Muslims (women, children and elderly) in a house on Pionirska Street, Nova Mahala, in the Visegrad region, before setting the house on fire. Those who tried to escape were killed. Around 70 people were found dead as a result of the fire, some survived; of the survivors, some were seriously injured.
Mitar Vasiljevic was arrested on 25 January 2000 by the SFOR. On the same day, he was transferred to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY).
