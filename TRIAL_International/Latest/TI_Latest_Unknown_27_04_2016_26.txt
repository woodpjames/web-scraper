facts

Fabien Bokila Lolemi was a member of the armed forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (Forces Armées de la République Démocratique du Congo, FARDC), where he served as Lieutenant Colonel in the 9th Battalion.
Bokila and other members of the Battalion in the past fought for the former rebel group known as Movement for the Liberation of Congo (MLC), lead by Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo. The MLC, after the end of the Second Congo War, turned into a political party and become a part of the new transitional government. Former soldiers of the MLC were therefore integrated into the armed forces of the country.
At the end of 2003, the 9th Battalion was deployed in the area of Songo Mboyo, a little village at 600 km from the town of Mbandaka, in the Equateur District. On 21 December 2003, Bokila Lolemi and other soldiers decided to mutiny against the commander of the Battalion, Captain Ramazani. According to the rebels’ claims, the Captain – together with other high-ranking officials – would have embezzled part of their wages.
In the night between 21 and 22 December 2003, the mutineers decided to vent their anger by massively raping the women of Songo Mboyo. Allegedly they raped 119 women, including some minors and the wives of some army senior officers. They would have also looted many houses of Songo Mboyo and of the near village of Bongandanga.
In April 2004, the United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUC) sent a group of inspectors from its human rights division to Equateur District, with the aim to conduct investigations on the facts of Songo Mboyo.
