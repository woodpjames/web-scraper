facts

Soeren Kam was born on 2 November 1921 in Kopenhagen, Denmark. He volunteered to join the Waffen-SS of Denmark in 1941 and served in the 5th Tank Division „Viking“, fighting on the east front against the Soviet Union during WW II. He was a co-founder of the Danish collaboration militia “Schalburgkorps” in 1941.
The Danish authorities accuse Kam of the murder of the Danish journalist Carl Henrik Clemmensen on 30 August 1943. This took place in Lyngby near Kopenhagen and Kam allegedly committed this act together with two other men, Flemming Helweg-Larsen and Joergen Valdemar Bitsch. The Danish authorities accused the three men of shooting Clemmensen to death.
In 1945, after the end of WW II, the Danish state prosecuted one of the alleged perpetrators, Flemming Helweg-Larsen, and sentented him to death for the murder of Clemmensen. Soeren Kam and Joergen Valdemar Bitsch had disappeared by then.
Kam had moved to Germany (West) where he lived under a false name for years. He took German citizenship in 1956. The Danish authorities eventually found him and requested his extradition. The German state, however, denied the extradition request on the ground that Kam had obtained German citizenship and could therefore not be extradited.
In 1968 the Public Prosecution Service Munich II took up preliminary proceedings against Kam.
