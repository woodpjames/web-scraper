facts

Major General Adam Rahmat Damiri was born on 20 November 1949. He has a military background. Between June 1998 and November 1999, he was Commander of the Udayana region, which covers East Timor. In December 1999, he was promoted to the position of Operations Assistant to the Chief of the Armed Forces at the army headquarters in Jakarta.
The accusations of criminal responsibility against him go back to the events which took place in East Timor in 1999.Around 1400 people were killed in the months leading up to a referendum on independence for the region, organised by the United Nations on 30 August 1999, and during the days following this vote . In addition, more than 250’000 people were transferred by force or fled to West Timor or Indonesia. A large number of people were also victims of other violations of human rights, notably of torture and rape. These crimes were carried out by the militia with the support and coordination of members of the armed forces, the police and the Indonesian Civilian Authorities in order to influence the outcome of the referendum and to upset adoption of the results of the referendum.
Adam Rahmat was said to have played a central role in the spread of violence in East Timor during all of this period. In his position of Commander of the Udayana region, he was in charge of security in East Timor during the time of martial law from 7 to 27 September 1999. It was during this period that the greatest number of exactions took place.
Moreover, Adam Rahmat Damiri was accused of having taken an active part in the organisation of the pro-Indonesian militia which were implicated in these events by ensuring that they were trained, funded and given arms. For this purpose he reportedly met with these militia leaders on several occasions from the end of 1998 and throughout all of 1999. His direct responsibility was also called into question in certain specific events, in particular for the massacres committed in the church in Liquica on 6 April 1999, at the home of the Independence Leader Manuel Carrascalao on 17 April 1999, in the Dili diocesan buildings on 5 September 1999, at the residence of the Bishop of Belo on 6 September 1999 and in the church in Suai on 6 September 1999.
On 22 February 2003, Adam Rahmat Damiri, and seven other highly placed military and civilian individuals, were indicted by “The Serious Crimes Unit”, a body set up by the United Nations Transitional Administration of East Timor (UNTAET).
