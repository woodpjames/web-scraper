Tihomir Oreskovic was born in what was then the Socialist Republic of Croatia.
In 1979 Oreskovic was sentenced for subversive propaganda within the Yugoslav National Army and imprisoned in the military prison in Belgrade. He was granted political asylum in the United States where he worked as a reporter before returning to Croatia in the early 1990s.
During the Croatian War of Independence, Oreskovic was the Secretary of Lika Crisis Headquarters. In December 1991 he was reassigned to Zagreb to work for the Security Intelligence Service of the Ministry of Defence.
In October 1991 lists were prepared naming all of the Serb civilians in Gospic and Karlobag. On 17 October 1991, Oreskovic, as Secretary of Lika Crisis Headquarters, along with 118th Infantry Brigade Lieutenant Colonel Mirko Norac, ordered the arrest, detention, and killing of the Serb civilians on the lists prepared earlier that month. At this time the Gospic police, the military police stationed in Gospic, and the 118th Infantry Brigade of the Croatian National Guard were under the control of the Lika Crisis Headquarters.
In mid-October 1991, more than 100 Serbs disappeared from Gospic and Karlobag. Between 16 and 17 October 1991 Serb civilians were arrested in Gospic and Karlobag. They were led away from bomb shelters at gunpoint, and a few days thereafter, some were transported away in lorries and never seen again. Some of the civilians were transported in a military truck to Pazariste where they were executed by a firing squad. It was alleged that Oreskovic checked the weapons of the firers at Pazariste to ensure that they had all fired their weapons.
On 18 October 1991, approximately 40 civilians who had been held at the Perusik barracks, where the 118th Infantry Brigade was stationed, were executed by firing squad at Lipova Glaniva. On 25 October 1991 three other Serb civilians were arrested in Gospic and Karlobag and shot. Their bodies were found in the Ravni Dabar area.
Following investigations into the alleged Gospic massacre, in September 2000 Oreskovic was arrested in Zagreb and transferred to Gospic. On 14 September 2000 Gospic County Court requested that the Supreme Court allow the trial to be held in a different location. The Supreme Court allowed it to be held in Rijeka County Court. In February 2001 an arrest warrant was issued for Oreskovic.
On 5 March 2001 the indictment was issued by the Rijeka County State Attorneyâ€™s Office. Oreskovic was indicted for ordering the executions of and executing Serb civilians in Gospic and Karlobag. The trial began in September 2002 and the indictment was amended on 13 March 2003.
