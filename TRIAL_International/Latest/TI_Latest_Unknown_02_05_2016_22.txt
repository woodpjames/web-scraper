facts

Emmanuel Bagambiki was born in 1948 in Cyangugu, Rwanda.
During the civil war, Emmanuel Bagambiki was préfet of the region of Cyangugu (i.e. he was the highest level government official at the prefectural and local state level).
At the beginning of April 1994, many Tutsis sought refuge in the cathedral of Cyangugu. From 11 April 1994, the cathedral was subjected to repeated attacks. On 15 April, Emmanuel Bagambiki and Lieutenant Samuel Imanshimwe (see “related cases”) reportedly ordered the refugees to move to the Cyangugu stadium.
The refugees were held captive in this stadium for several weeks. Those who attempted to escape were either brought back or executed on the spot. During this period, the Interahamwe (an extremist Hutu militia of the National Republican Movement for Development and Democracy – MRND) were also said to have taken part in the capture and execution of these refugees.
On several occasions, between April and June 1994, government officials from Cyangugu, using pre-established lists, made a selection of a certain number of refugees held in this stadium. These people were subsequently arrested and executed.
Between April and June 1994, many Tutsis and moderate Hutus were arrested and taken to shacks in Cyangugu where they were subjected to torture before being executed.
During the same period, the regular army as well as the Interahamwe massacred individuals from the Tutsi civilian population.
In all, tens of thousands of people, in majority Tutsis, were massacred during the civil war in the prefectural region of Cyangugu.
Emmanuel Bagambiki was arrested in Togo on 5 June 1998 and transferred to the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) the following month.
