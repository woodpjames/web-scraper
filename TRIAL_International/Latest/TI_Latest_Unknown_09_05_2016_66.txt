facts


Krunoslav Bonic was allegedly serving in the Croatian Defence Council in central Bosnia during the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina. He left the country after the end of the conflict and has been living since 2008 and between 1998 and 2001, at least intermittently in Canberra, Australia, with his wife and children.
Bonic’s name has come up in trials of other defendants at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (or ICTY) in the Hague in the late 1990s and early 2000s, with witnesses alleging that he was involved in beatings and interrogations in central Bosnia during the conflict and further allegations that he was later found to be in possession of the ears of dead soldiers in a bag. At the time of the find, Bonic allegedly responded that he intended to sell them to the Croatian Defence Council for 200 German marks.
Bonic was further accused of helping rounding up, interrogating and beating Muslim civilians during the conflict in the Vitez area in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the early 1990s.
For these alleged crimes, Bonic was accused of war crimes against Bosniac Muslim civilians in the Vitez area and he was both arrested on a Bosnian and Herzegovinian extradition warrant and held in custody in Canberra, Australia.
