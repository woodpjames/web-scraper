Enforced disappearance of Ibrahim Duric in May 1992
12.02.2016
The General Context 
It is estimated that between 100,000 and 200,000 persons died as a consequence of the conflict (1992-1995) in BiH and that between 25,000 and 30,000 were victims of enforced disappearance. Approximately 13.000 people remain disappeared to date.
The case of Ibrahim Durić occurred in the context of a first wave of enforced disappearances and “ethnic cleansing” operations perpetrated by the Serb army in the spring and summer of 1992.
To date no one has been convicted, prosecuted and sanctioned for the arbitrary deprivation of liberty and subsequent enforced disappearance of Ibrahim Durić, thus fostering an overall climate of impunity. Up to this day, the family of Ibrahim Durić still has not received any information on the fate and whereabouts of their loved one.
