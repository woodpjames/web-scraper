facts 

Zoran Kolic is from Dobrotin, Kosovo. He was a guard at the Lipjan prison during the conflict in Kosovo at the end of the 1990s. He has two children.
Following the NATO bombing of Dubrava Prison on 19 and 21 May 1999 and the ensuing massacre on 22 May, surviving prisoners were transferred to Lipjan Prison on 24 May. The prisoners were allegedly forced to pass through two lines of Serbian prison guards, police and paramilitaries, who kicked, punched and beat them with rubber batons. Kolic allegedly participated in this inhumane treatment of prisoners. One of the detainees Kolic is alleged to have beaten was left unconsciousness, and died the next day.
The investigation into the case did not begin until 2011 when one of the detainees allegedly beaten by Kolic made a formal complaint to the police. Kolic was arrested on 7 April 2011.
