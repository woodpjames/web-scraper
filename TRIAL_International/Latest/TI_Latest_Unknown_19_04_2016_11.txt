Alfred Schönenberg was born in 1921 and died in 2006. In 1944, he held the position of Second-Lieutenant in the 16th SS tank division “Reichsführer SS”.
In the summer of 1944, at the time of the facts alleged in the indictment, the German forces were in retreat in Italy as they were almost everywhere else in Europe. Their forces had already pulled back as far as Tuscany.
On 12 August 1944, shortly after 6 a.m., four companies – amounting to approximately 300 soldiers of the SS – made their way up to the remote mountain village of Sant’Anna di Stazzema. At the time, the village had a population of around 400 and was sheltering several hundred refugees.
Officially, the mission of the SS was to take action against the Italian guerrillas. It was known at the time that the policy of the German high command towards the armed resistance in Italy-la “Resistenza”-was particularly vicious. According to an official document, army officers were not to be subject to punishment for any brutal acts they might commit.
The inhabitants of Sant’Anna were forced to assemble in enclosed farmyards and in the village square. Thereafter, SS soldiers, together with the Second-Lieutenants Gerhard Sommer, Ludwig Sonntag (see “related cases”) and Alfred Schönenberg, massacred anyone whom they came across, using machine guns, bayonets, hand grenades and flame-throwers. The victims were mainly women, children and old men (the younger men were not in the village at that time). The soldiers then burned the bodies and set fire to the buildings. The entire village was completely destroyed in less than four hours. The massacre resulted in 560 deaths, of which 116 were children. Sant’Anna di Stazzema was never rebuilt.
