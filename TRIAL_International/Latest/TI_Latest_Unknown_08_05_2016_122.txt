Jean-Paul Birindabagabo was born in 1956. He is of Hutu ethnicity and is a native of Rubavu. He was president of an agricultural cooperative company in Sake, in the south east of Rwanda when the genocide broke out in April 1994. He was considered to be an important member of the National Revolutionary Movement for Development (MRND, French) in the Kibungo prefecture, which today includes the districts of Ngoma and Kirehe, at the time of the Rwandan genocide. He is accused of having planned and executed the massacre of Tutsi populations in this region.
During the genocide in 1994, Birindabagabo allegedly entered a church where Tutsi civilians had gone to find refuge. According to a survivor of the massacres, he murdered a pastor who was praying there together with the refugees, by shooting him at point-blank range. Shortly afterwards, a troop of soldiers then reportedly went into the church and exterminated the rest of the Tutsis assembled there.
At the end of the genocide, he fled the country, residing in the first instance in the Democratic Republic of Congo, then later in Uganda where he changed his name. The Interpol Director of the Ugandan police stated that before his arrest, on Thursday 8 January 2015, the suspect resided illegally in Uganda where he passed himself off as a pastor, with responsibility for an evangelical church in the town of Buwama.
On 14 January 2015, the Ugandan police extradited Birindabagabo, who had been put on an Interpol red alert list following the issuance of an International Arrest Warrant by Rwanda.
