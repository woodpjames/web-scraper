Colonel Adémar Ilunga, also known as Kote Kubaya Kisu Makali, was the Commander of the 62nd Brigade of the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Congo (FARDC). His alias means “Evil in all respects with sharp knife”. He is considered a Katangan gendarme trained in Angola.
He is alleged to have been implicated in illegal trade of copper ore from the mines in the territory of Pweto and in several crimes committed against the civilian population.
On 14 October 2004, the town of Kilwa came under the control of the Revolutionary Movement for the Liberation of Katanga. On 15 October, the town was retaken by the 62nd Brigade of the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (FARDC) led by Ilunga. During the operation, the FADRC allegedly committed serious violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law.
Ilunga and his men are alleged to have summarily executed at least 25 civilians, and to have indulged in rape, torture, illegal detention, looting and wanton destruction throughout the town. The United Nations Mission to Congo (MONUC) reported that more than 100 persons were killed.
