facts

Johann Breyer was born on 30 May 1925, in the village of Neuwalldorf, in the former Czechoslovakia (now known as Novà Lesnà, Slovakia). In 1942, at the age of 17, he voluntarily joined the Waffen-SS (“armed protective squadron”) in Nazi Germany and was assigned the role of armed guard at the concentration camps of Buchenwald and Auschwitz, in Germany and Poland respectively.
Breyer acknowledged serving as a SS-Totenkopf (“Death’s Head”) guard and escorting prisoners to their work sites at the concentration camps, but he always denied having played any personal role in or having witnessed any of the atrocities perpetrated in the concentration camps.
In May 1952, Breyer entered the US under an immigrant visa, and claimed citizenship. He became a naturalised citizen in 1957.
In 1992, the American Office of Special Investigations became aware of Breyer’s role in the Waffen-SS. As a consequence, the US government immediately filed a denaturalisation action with the District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.
