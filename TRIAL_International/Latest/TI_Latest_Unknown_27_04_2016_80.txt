facts

Luis Alfredo Maurente Mata, alias “309” was born in Uruguay on 1 March 1947. He joined the army in 1966. Maurente has been accused and convicted for his involvement in the torture, forced disappearance and murder of Uruguayan leftist dissidents during the dictatorship of 1970-1980.
In 1976, Luis Maurente was amongst those responsible for the detention and torture of Uruguayan citizens at “Automotores Orletti”, a secret detention centre in Buenos Aires. He was personally involved in the illegal transfer of around fifty citizens. Around twenty of these were passengers of the so-called “second flight” of Orletti. Uruguayan dissidents seeking refuge in Argentina were detained and tortured at the centre and then illegally deported to Uruguay as part of Operation Condor.
Maurente and other military personnel responsible for these acts were protected by the so-called “Ley de Caducidad de la Pretension Punitiva del Estado” (Amnesty Law for Punitive Claims of the State), which gave immunity to members of the police and armed forces who violated human rights. This law was passed in 1986 by the first government in power since the restoration of democracy, and was ratified following two referendums in 1989 and 2009. The law has been the subject of much criticism due to the circumstances surrounding its ratification.
The amnesty law was reinterpreted under the administration of President Tabaré Vázquez (2005-2010), facilitating the prosecution of former members of the police and armed forces for crimes committed during the regime.
In September 2006, Luis Maurente was captured in Montevideo and arrested on charges of “deprivation of liberty” and “conspiracy to commit crimes” for the disappearance in 1976 of activists from the PVP (Partido urugayo izquierdista de la Victoria del Pueblo), a Uruguayan leftist party, who were refugees in Argentina.
