facts

Otilio Romano is Argentinian. He was born on 3 April 1943 in Mendoza, Argentina. During the military dictatorship from 1976 to 1983 he was a federal judge.
On 22 March 2010 Romano was the subject of a complaint made by several bodies that defend human rights, notably from Mendoza, Argentina. Alongside other judges and members of the military he was accused by these organisations of having co-operated with the dictatorship. Romano is suspected of having covered up certain crimes against humanity. For example he refused to speak in an interview about the crimes he was present at, among which kidnapping, forced disappearances, torture or even denial of justice featured.
Following the accusations that they were co-operating with the military dictatorship, the National Judiciary Council suspended Romano from his duties in office on 23 August 2011. On 24 August 2011 he fled to Chile. He stayed there on an eight month tourist visa. On 1 September 2011 he sought asylum on the grounds that he would be a victim of persecution in Argentina. Following his escape he settled in the coastal town of Re√±aca.
