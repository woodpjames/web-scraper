facts

Kenryo Sato was born 1895 and was graduated from Military Academy in 1917. In 1937, Kenryo Sato, then a Member of the Military Bureau Affairs, was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel; the same year, he was appointed an Investigator of the Planning Board, of which, he was for a time secretary. He was also a member of different bodies in greater or less degree connected with Japan’s war in China and its contemplated wars with other countries.
In February 1938, as the Konoye Cabinet presented the General Mobilization Law to the Diet, Kenryo Sato was employed as an “explainer” and made a speech before the Diet in support of the measure. In February 1941, Kenryo Sato was appointed Chief of the Military Affairs Section, then he was promoted Major General in October 1941 and, in April 1942, he became Chief of the Military Affairs Bureau.
In 1938, Kenryo Sato delivered a speech, explaining the Army point of view on the war in China. According to the statement of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East (IMTFE), he showed complete familiarity with the detailed terms, upon which Japan was prepared to settle the war against China. These plainly involved the abolition of the legitimate government of China, recognition of the puppet state of Manchukuo whose resources had been largely exploited for Japan’s benefit, and the stationing of Japanese troops in China. He stated that North China would be put completely under Japan’s control and its resources developed for national defence, i.e. to aid Japan’s military preparations. He also predicted that Japan would go to war with the USSR.
Kenryo Sato was arrested and put on trial by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East (IMTFE) for war crimes.
