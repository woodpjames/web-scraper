facts

Baldur von Schirach was born on 9 May 1907 in Berlin. Born into a family of army officers he had an American mother. He joined the Nazi party in 1925 after meeting with Adolf Hitler.
He became head of the Hitler Student Union in 1929 and then head of the Hitler Youth Movement in 1933, a position he held until 1940. United under his authority were all of the German youth movements, accounting for 8 million members in 1938. He therefore played an important role in the youth enlistment into the Nazi movement. Both the army and the SS benefited from an important breeding ground in these movements under the direction of von Schirach. Baldur von Schirach was also a member of the Reichstag, the German parliament.
In 1940 he was appointed Gauleiter and Governor of Vienna where he pursued the policy of arrest and deportation of Jews. Nevertheless he lost influence after having pleaded with Hitler for a better treatment of people in the East and after criticising the way in which the deportation of the Jews was being carried out.
Baldur von Schirach was accused of having used his various official functions, his personal influence and close contacts to the FÃ¼hrer, to promote the accession to power of the Nazi conspirators and the consolidation of their power in Germany, in terms of the count of indictment No1. Also in terms of count No 1, he was accused of promoting the psychological and educational preparations for war as well as the militarization of the organisations dominated by the Nazis. In addition he was also accused of having authorised, directed and taken part in crimes against humanity according to count No 4, due especially to the measures adopted against the Jews.
At the end of the war, von Schirach was arrested by the Allies.
