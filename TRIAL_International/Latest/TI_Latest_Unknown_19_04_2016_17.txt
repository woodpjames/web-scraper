facts

Henry Kiprono Kosgey was born in 1947 in Kenya and belongs to the Kalenjin tribe. He studied chemistry at the University of Nairobi and holds a Bachelor of Science.
In 2007 he was elected to represent the Tinderet Constituency in Nandi District, Rift Valley Province, as a Member of Parliament. He had previously represented Tinderet in the National Assembly of Kenya from 1979-1988 and from 1992-2007.
Earlier a member of the Kenya African National Union (KANU), he later joined the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM), a party which arose from a political movement opposing a new constitution in the 2005 Kenyan constitutional referendum.
In his political career, Kogsey has held several ministerial positions: From 1980-1985 he was the Minister for Transport and Communications, from 1985-1986 the Minister for Cooperative Development, from 1987-1988 the Minister for Environment and Natural Resources, from 1998-1999 the Minister for Tourism, from 1999-2001 the Minister for Science and Technology and from 2001-2006 the Minister for Education.
He was the Chairman of the ODM and the Minister of Industrialization, post to which he resigned on 4 January 2011.
From December 2006 on, Kosgey, along with William Samoei Ruto and Joshua Arap Sang, allegedly established a network with the aim of committing crimes directed against supporters of the Party of National Unity (PNU). Their goals were to gain power in the Rift Valley Province and the Kenyan Government and to punish and expel from the Rift Valley those perceived to support the PNU.
After the Electoral Commission of Kenya declared on 30 December 2007 that Mwai Kibaki, the candidate for the PNU, had won the presidential election of 27 December 2007, thousands of members of the network allegedly began to attack PNU supporters in Turbo, Huruma, Kimumu, Langas, Yamumbi, Kapsabet and Mandi Hills. The network members allegedly burnt down the houses of political opponents, killed civilians and forced them out of their homes. On 1 January 2008, they allegedly burnt down a church in Kiambaa with more than 100 people inside the church. At least 17 people died.
On 15 December 2010 the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) requested the Pre-Trial Chamber II of the ICC to issue summonses to appear for Henry Kosgey, William Ruto and Joshua Sang. According to the Prosecutor, there are reasonable grounds to believe that they are criminally responsible under article 25 of the Rome Statute (individual criminal responsibility) for murder, torture, deportation or forcible transfer and persecution on political grounds as crimes against humanity, pursuant to article 7 of the Rome Statute.
