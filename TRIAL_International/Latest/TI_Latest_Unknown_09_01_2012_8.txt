facts

Goran Jelisic was born on 7 June 1968 in Bijelijna in Bosnia Herzegovina which is today in the Srpska Republic.
On 1 May 1992, the Muslim and Croatian population in the town of Brcko a municipality in Bosnia Herzegovina were advised by radio to surrender their arms. Immediately after this announcement, the Serb forces, which included soldiers, paramilitary forces and policemen, took over control of the town.
The Serb forces expelled the Muslim and Croatian population from their homes and grouped them together in assembly camps. The Muslim and Croatian men, aged between 16 and 60 years old (at an age to bear arms), as well as a few women, were then transferred to the camp at Luka.
Based on his own statements made during his guilty plea, Goran Jelisic arrived at the Brcko camp around 1 May 1992.
Between 7 and 21 May 1992, the prisoners in the Luka camp were the subject of a systematic campaign to have them eliminated.
On numerous occasions, with help from the camp guards, Goran Jelisic choose groups of detainees to be interrogated before being beaten and, very often, executed.
As a general rule, the victims were shot at point blank range with a bullet to the head or in the back.
Overall, Goran Jelisic was found guilty of the murder of a total of 13 people, of inflicting cruel treatment on 4 people and of stealing money from 4 detainees at the Luka camp. However, it remains possible that he killed or battered many more than this. In this respect, he is reported to have declared to a prisoner on 15 May 1992, that he was at his “eighty third affair”.
Goran Jelisic was arrested by the SFOR (Multinational Stabilisation force for Bosnia-Herzegovina) on 22 January 1998. He was transferred to the ICTY (International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia), on the same day.
