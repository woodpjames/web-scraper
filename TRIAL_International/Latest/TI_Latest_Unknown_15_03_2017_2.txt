Facts

Radisav Ljubinac was born on 12 January 1958 in the Municipality of Rogatica in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Ljubinac was accused of having participated in the persecution of Bosniak civilians in the Municipality of Rogatica from May to November 1992, carried out as part of a widespread and systematic attack by the Army and Police of the so-called Serb Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and by paramilitary units under the leadership of the Serb Democratic Party (SDS).
Ljubinac allegedly took part in attacks and expulsion of people from the village of Seljani, some of whom have disappeared since then. In particular, on 26 May 1992, he allegedly picked up a Bosniak civilian, who never came back. On 28 July 1992, together with a suspect known as “Macola”, the accused allegedly picked up another Bosniak civilian from the camp “Veljko Vlahović”, who went also missing. Moreover, he was accused of having participated, on 3 June 1992, in the detention of civilians, the separation of women and children from men and the taking of 15 civilians who were later killed. The bodies of the killed persons were exhumed in October 2004 from a mass grave in Dizdareva njiva, close to Ljubinac’s house.
In addition, on 3 and 4 August 1992, he allegedly forcibly transferred women, children and several men from the Seljani village to the camp “Veljko Vlahović”, where he allegedly robbed the detainees of their possessions.
It has also been claimed that between August and November 1992, Ljubinac forced the detainees from the “Rasadnik” camp to perform forced labour for the Serb army. Furthermore, he was accused of having driven 27 civilians to the village of Duljevac on 15 August 1992, where they were first used as human shields and then executed by a firing squad.
