Milisav Atanackovic, a Croatian, is one of multiple former Croatian Serb fighters who allegedly committed war crimes during the Battle of Vukovar in eastern Croatia in 1991. The battle was an 87-day siege of Vukovar supported by various paramilitary forces from Serbia, between August and November 1991.
In 1990, an armed insurrection was started by Croatian Serb militias, supported by the Serbian government and paramilitary groups, who seized control of Serb-populated areas of Croatia. Conflict broke out in the eastern Croatian region of Slavonia in May 1991. In August 1991, a full-scale attack was launched by the Yugoslav Peopleâ€™s Army and supported by various Serb paramilitary forces against Croatian-held territory in eastern Slavonia, including Vukovar. Vukovar was defended by around 1,800 lightly armed soldiers of the Croatian National Guard (ZNG) and civilian volunteers, and faced 36,000 soldiers and Serbian paramilitaries equipped with heavy armour and artillery.
When Vukovar fell on 18 November 1991, hundreds of Croatian soldiers and civilians were massacred by Serb forces and at least 31,000 civilians were deported from the Vukovar area. Most of the Vukovar area was ethnically cleansed of its non-Serb population. From September to November 1991, Atanackovic and multiple other former Croatian Serb fighters are alleged to have unlawfully detained, mistreated, physically and sexually abused, tortured, raped, and murdered between 14 and 60 civilians and Croatian military prisoners in Borovo Naselje, a northern suburb of Vukovar, and Trpinja, ten kilometres northwest of Vukovar. Subsequently, Atanackovic was arrested in a joint operation by the Osijek and Vukovar police on 11 July 2013.
