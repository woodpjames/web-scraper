facts

Mustafa al-Khouli is a former leader of the Islamic organization Muslim Brotherhood; he was in charge of the organization office in Damanhour.
Along with Mohammed Abdel Radi, the former leader of the Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) of Damanhour, Al-Khouli is accused of participating in the illegal arrest and subsequent torture of three Egyptian students during the conflicts in November 2012. The conflicts were between those who were in favour of President Morsi and those who were against him. These conflicts took place in Damanhour, in the north of Egypt, and were part of a wave of protests and violence caused by President Morsi’s decree to temporarily increase his powers and to give judicial immunity to a group led by Islamists who edited and rapidly approved a new constitution.
On 24 November 2012, Al-Khouli and Abdel Radi allegedly kidnapped the following Egyptian students; Mahmoud Ali Sahin (17 years old), Mohammed Mansour Morsi (18) and Mustafa Faraj Saqr (21). They held them for five hours at the FJP headquarters in Damanhour. They were held separately and allegedly beaten with sticks.
Mohammed Soudan, FJP spokesperson, denied the accusations against Al-Khouli andMohammed Abdel Radi. According to his statement, the FJP headquarters in Damanhour was attacked on 24 November 2012 by members of the Al-Dostour party and the revolutionary socialist party; members of the Muslim Brotherhood who tried to defend the offices against the attack were injured. Then, according to him, three attackers went to the police station and made a complaint against Al-Khouli and Abdel Radi, accusing them of torture.
In April 2013, Mustafa Al-Khouli and Mohammed Abdel Radi were tried in court. Prior to this, the three alleged victims and their supporters protested outside the town’s public prosecutor’s office for two days for what they considered to be a deliberate standstill preventing the case from going to court.
