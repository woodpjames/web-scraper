Facts

Antonio Gonzalez Pacheco, also known as “Billy el Niño”, was born in 1946 in Spain. He is a former member of the Francoist police, where he served in the Political Brigade and was renowned for ill-treatments inflicted on prisoners. After the collapse of the regime, he became inspector of the Superior Constabulary established during the Spanish Transition to democracy.
Between February 1971 and September 1975, Gonzalez Pacheco allegedly subjected at least 13 prisoners to torture during detention and interrogation at the headquarters of the Direction-General of Security (DGS). All his victims, mainly university students and militants arrested during strikes and rallies, described extremely violent practices, often exceeding the purpose of obtaining information or confessions and attributed to the cruel and sadist nature of the policeman. His means reportedly included severe beatings, waterboarding, electroshock, foot whipping and death threats.
