facts 


Velemir Djuric was a member of the Bosnian Serb Army’s Intelligence Centre during the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
During a widespread and systematic attack launched against the non-Serb civilian population of the municipality of Prijedor, in the Republika Srpska, Dragomir Soldat, a police officer in the 43rd Motorised Brigade of the Bosnian Serb Army and the superior of Djuric, ordered on 23 July 1992 the killing of all men living in the village of Carakovo, in Prijedor.
Djuric, along with Zoran Babic, the Deputy Chief of the Public Security Center in Prijedor, and other men under Soldat’s command, carried out the order. They took ten Bosnian civilians residing in the village from their houses, escorted them to the local mosque, and shot them there. Then, they set the mosque on fire, thus killing the few wounded civilians who managed to survive to the shooting.
On 4 December 2012, upon the order of the Prosecution of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Djuric and Soldat were arrested in Prijedor, and remanded in custody, as they represented a high flight risk.
