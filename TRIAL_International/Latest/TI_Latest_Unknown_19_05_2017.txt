Facts

Arnubio Triana Mahecha (a.k.a Botalón) was born in 1964 in Cundinamarca. Later he moved with his parents to Cimitarra (Santander), a town torn by the internal armed conflict between the guerrillas and the paramilitaries. In 1988 he joined Self-Defense Forces of Puerto Boyaca (ABP). He negotiated the demobilization of his men with the government of César Gaviria in December 1991. Triana was part of the fighters who surrendered their weapons.
In 1994 Triana rearmed the ABP and become their commander. In 1997 when Fidel, Vicente and Carlos Castaño created the United Self Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC), the block commanded by Triana joined. The AUC was a paramilitary group, actively involved in the Colombian armed conflit, known for its extensive drug trafficking as well as abundant human rights crimes. Between 1994 and 2006, 427 people disappeared in the area controlled by AUC.
As part of the peace talks, negotiations for the AUC to demobilize began under President Alvaro Uribe‘s presidency in 2003 and ended in January 2006. As part of the process, the law of Justice and Peace was ratified in order to provide procedural and judicial benefits, including a maximum prison sentence of eight years and exemption from extradition to the U.S., to AUC members in exchange for their demobilization and cooperation.
