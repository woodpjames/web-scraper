facts

By virtue of his role as Commander of the Ministry of Health’s security forces, Hamid Al-Shamari was responsible for the safety and protection of the Ministry and the hospitals. He is a member of Moqtada al-Sadr’s radical Shiite movement.
Ordered by Hamid Al-Shamari and Hakim al-Zamili (see: “subdivisions”), death squads acted within the ministry and affiliated institutions, particularly within hospitals. Hospitals began to be controlled by the Mahdi Army, a principal Iraqi Shiite militia created by Moqtada al-Sadr. The Mahdi Army was well known for the part it played in the Iraqi sectarian violence.
These death squads used Ministry of Health passes to be able to move freely around Baghdad; ambulances were used to transport weapons. Between 2005 and 2007, they were responsible for several hundred Iraqi kidnappings and murders, predominantly involving Sunnites. These crimes occurred at 3 of Baghdad’s most important hospitals (Al Yarmouk, Ibn al-Nafees and Al Nur) and were aimed at Sunnite patients, their relatives and the medical staff.
As the commander of the Ministry of Health’s security services, Hamid al-Shammari is suspected of having supported these death squads and the Mahdi Army militia. In addition, he is suspected of having participated in sectarian crimes against several hundred Sunnite Iraqis.
He was arrested in March 2007, only a few days after the arrest of Hakim al-Zamili, who was at the time the deputy Health Minister.
