Héctor Mario López Fuentes was chief of National Defence Staff of Guatemala between 1982 and 1983 during the military regime headed by General Efrain Rios Montt, who was ousted in turn by the coup led by Oscar Humberto Mejía Victores. Lopez was the third most important chief of the military dictatorship after the President and Minister of Defense.
During this period López Fuentes planned and authorized the operations Victoria 82, Firmeza 83 and Sofía, which aimed to repress the civilian population that supposedly supported the guerrillas in the region of the Ixil Triangle in Quiché. These operations led by the army have killed about 317 people. Lopez is likewise accused of having participated in at least 77 cases of forced disappearance, torture and extrajudicial executions.
