Facts

Khaled Mashaal was born in 1956 in Silwad in the West Bank (Palestine). In 1967, his family moved to Kuwait for financial reasons. In 1971, Mashaal joined the Muslim Brotherhood at the age of 15. He graduated from Kuwait University earning a BSc in Physics in 1978. While attending Kuwait University, Mashaal created the student organisation ‘List of the Islamic Right’. Following his graduation, he worked as a physics teacher. He took an active part in the creation of the Islamic Resistance Movement (HAMAS) in 1987 and led its Kuwait wing.
Mashaal is viewed as one of the most influential political leaders of HAMAS and most visible spokesman. In 1997, he survived from an assassination attempt led by the Israeli Mossad.
According to ZAKA, an Israeli voluntary community emergency response organisation committed to the recovery and identification of human remains, HAMAS killed 176 civilians and wounded hundreds more in various HAMAS-sponsored terror attacks and suicide bombings and the shelling of the city of Sderot that took place in 2002.
Moreover, the NGO Shurat Hadin (the Israel Law Centre) alleged that on 28 July 2014, HAMAS publically and summarily executed 20 Palestinian civilians from Gaza, for engaging in anti-war protests against the rule of HAMAS. Then, on 22 August 2014, Hamas allegedly executed 18 Palestinian civilians for their supposed collaboration with Israel in the assassination of three HAMAS military leaders, and the attempted assassination of the military chief Mohammed Deif. Seven of these civilians were executed publically.
