facts

Makitan Ahmet, was born in Dubrava or Ljubljanica near Stolac in 1967. He used to work as a waiter in Capljina and later worked as a guard at the “Dretelj” detention camp. He moved to Sweden in 2001 and obtained Swedish citizenship five years later.
In May 1992 the Croat Armed Forces (HOS) established a prison camp for Serbs in Dretelj near Èapljina. The prisoners of this camp were exclusively Serbs. The camp was situated on the premises of a former warehouse of the Yugoslav People’s Army. According to the data available, each warehouse was roughly 200 square meters, of which the Croats placed between 400 to 700 prisoners.
The Committee for the collection of data on crimes against humanity and international law have reported on crimes committed by the guards at the camp. The arrested Serbs lived under extreme conditions. Witnesses have testified about inhumane treatment where they were forced to graze and swallow grass, kiss animals, have homosexual intercourse or intercourse with animals, daily beating and torture and other inhumane treatment. Makitan Ahmet was implicated by a number of witnesses from the camp who said that he ordered them to do all the above.
Makitan Ahmet is therefore held on suspicion of war crimes.
He was arrested on 12 January 2010 by the War Crimes Investigation Department of the Swedish Police.
