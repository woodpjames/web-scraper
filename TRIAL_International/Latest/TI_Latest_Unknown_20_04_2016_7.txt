facts

Elizaphan Ntakirutimana was born in 1924 in Ngoma, Rwanda. He was a senior pastor of the Church of the Seventh Day Adventists in the Mugonero Complex in Ngoma.
Between April and June 1994, he allegedly instigated and took part in murders of Tutsi civilians in the Mugonero and Bisesero regions.
Notably on 16 April 1994, he reportedly conveyed to the Mugonero Adventist Complex a group of armed men and ordered the removal of the church roof so that it could no longer be used as a shelter by Tutsi civilians who had taken refuge inside. In so doing, he allegedly facilitated the hunting down, the killing and the infliction of serious bodily and mental harm to a large number of men, women and children, in great majority Tutsis.
In the same period of 1994, Elizaphan Ntakirutimana allegedly participated in several vehicle convoys carrying attackers to various locations in the Bisesero region, facilitating massacres of civilians.
