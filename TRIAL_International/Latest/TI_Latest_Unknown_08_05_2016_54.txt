facts


Dinko Sakic was born in Studenci, Croatia on 8 September 1921. He finished his education at the end of high school. He then joined the Ustasha nationalist organisation. This organisation is a Croatian fascist movement which took over in Croatia in 1941 after the Italian and German invasion of Yugoslavia.
In 1941, Sakic worked for the administration of the Jasenovac Camp. This camp created and ruled by the Ustashi Croat regime was the largest of Croatia. Between 85’000 and 700’000 Serbs, Jewish and Roma were allegedly killed in that camp. The following year, in 1942, Sakic became second in command of the camp. He then climbed up the corporate ladder to become, in 1944 and for seven months, Commander of the camp.
During this time, Sakic took part personally in the killing and torture of the prisoners of the camp. Not only did he give the order to kill and torture, but he also personally participated in them and let his subordinates of the Ustasha organisation do so as well.
According to the indictment, he allegedly forced labor and starved the prisoners. He subjected them to severe bodily injury and used torture and killings.
At the end of the war, Sakic and his wife fled to Spain and then settled in Argentina. In 1947, Sakic began operating a textile company and lived there without hiding his real identity for 50 years. In April 1998, he gave a television interview which was broadcasted on a national Argentinean channel. He admitted to being the commander of the Jasenovac camp and stated that no prisoners were killed by guards. Following the reactions of the broadcast, Sakic was extradited and sent back to Croatia. His trial started in 1999 in Zagreb.
