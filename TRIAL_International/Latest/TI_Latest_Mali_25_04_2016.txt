Mirko Malinovic was born on 31 May 1962. In October 1991, Malinovic was in the paramilitary as a member of the Ministry of Interior of the Serbian Autonomous Oblast of Krajina (SAO Krajina) and the Territorial Defence Teslingrad.
In October 1991, Mane Rakic and his sons Dragan, Milovan and daughter Radmila were arrested in the city of Teslingrad, suspected of cooperating with Croatian armed forces, particularly through a transmitter in their possession.
During the night of 21 October 1991 Malinovic and his co-accused Milan Bogunovic (also a member of the Ministry of Interior of the SAO Krajina) and Cedo Budisavljevic (commander of the special unit of the Ministry of Interior of the SAO Krajina Teslingrad and Deputy Commander of Police Station) went to the house of Mane Rakicâ€™s wife Lucia Rakic. While Malinovic and Bogunovic, both armed, guarded the outside of the house, Budisavljevic killed Lucia Rakic. The three men then set fire to the body of the latter and left to burn the house.
A few days later, the same three defendants, along with Bogdan Gruici (Member of the Teslingrad police) and Goran Novakovic (member of the Ministry of Interior of the SAO Krajina), removed Mane Rakic as well as his sons and daughter from the police station where they were detained. They tied them and led them to the pits of Golubnjaca where they killed them by gun shots and then threw them in the pit.
Malinovic was arrested on 28 December 2009 and remanded in custody in Belgrade.
