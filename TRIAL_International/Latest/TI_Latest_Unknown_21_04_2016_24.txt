On 15 August 1972, during the dictatorship of General Agustín Lanusse in Argentina, 25 political prisoners belonging to an extreme left organisation who had taken up arms against the military regime, were trying to escape from the prison of Rawson in the province of Chubut, in the Argentinean region of Patagonia. Six of them managed to board a plane and to flee towards Chile, with the other 19 being surrounded and detained at the airport. Captain Luis Emilio Sosa accepted to take them safe and sound to the Rawson prison on the condition that they handed over their arms.
The prisoners handed over their weapons, but Sosa went back on his promise and they were taken to the Amiral Zar naval base in Trelew. On 22 August 1972 at 3 in the morning, captains Luis Emilio Sosa, Rubén Paccagnini and Raúl Herrera and deputies Emilio del Real and Carlos Bravo allegedly ordered corporal Carlos Marandino to open the cell doors in the prison, to wake up the prisoners, make them leave the cells and to line them up two by two. The 5 officials from the fleet fired at them point blank. Three of the prisoners survived and 16 died, the majority from a shot to the back of the neck.
According to the version of the events given by the sailors and the dictator Lanusse, one of the prisoners tried to take possession of a gun and escape.
This incident is considered to be the first illegal act of state terrorism used as a systematic method of repression against armed political organisations in Argentina.
For 20 years, the home of Herrera was maintained in secret by the navy.
In February 2006, the family of María Angélica Sabelli, one of the victims, filed a complaint against the sailors in front of the federal tribunal of Rawson near Trelew (Argentina), she was soon followed other families of victims.
