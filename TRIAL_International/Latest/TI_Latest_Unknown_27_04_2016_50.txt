facts

Marie Claire Mukeshimana was born in 1969 in southern Rwanda in the former regional capital, Butare. A hutu, she worked as a human resources manager until 2005 at World Vision, Kigali (the capital city of Rwanda).
Mukeshimana was involved in the death of a number of children who were seeking refuge in a convent in Save, southern Rwanda. Of particular note was her complicity in the kidnapping of a child who was handed over to the genocidaires. This took place in 1994 during the genocide that led to more than 800 000 deaths between April and June, predominantly from the Tutsi ethnicity.
In 2005 she left Rwanda. This followed the institution of the Gacaca courts and the initiation of data collection on the perpetrators of genocide. She had tried to enter the United States of America in 2010 using a tourist visa. After lying to obtain entry papers, she was later arrested at Detroit airport and held in custody. Subsequently, in June 2011, the immigration judge ordered her deportation.
There was no arrest warrant for Mukeshimana. The American authorities handed her over to the Rwandan National Police. The aircraft carrying her landed in Kigali International Airport during the night of Wednesday 21 December â€“ Thursday 22 December 2011.
