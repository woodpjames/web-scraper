Facts

Lieutenant Colonel and Chief Maro Ntumwa, known as “Moroccan”, was the right hand of Bedi Mobuli Engengela, known as “Colonel 106”, a Mai-Mai militia leader. From 2005 to 2007, this militia group fought the Congolese army in order to take possession of Kalahe territory in South Kivu.
The group persecuted hundreds of villagers in complete impunity. During these attacks, male civilians were either killed on the spot or taken as prisoners to transport looted goods, while the women and girls were kept as sex slaves.
In 2007, the group was finally defeated and its commanders, known as “Colonel 106” and “Moroccan”, were arrested. The former has already been sentenced to life long imprisonment.
