Georges Boudarel was born in 1926 in Saint Etienne, France. He joined the French Communist Party in 1946.
In 1948, Boudarel left for Indochina where he taught in French schools in Vietnam and Laos until 1950. That same year, he joined the Indochinese Communist Party and the Vietminh, the communist army of national liberation fighting against French colonial power.
Between June 1952 and February 1954, Boudarel was a political Commissioner of Vietminh in charge of the propaganda, with the nom de guerre of Dai Dong. As such, he was allegedly responsible for the ideological re-education of French soldiers taken prisoners by the Vietminh.
From February 1953 to February 1954, he was sent to Camp 113, situated in northern Tonkin. He is alleged to have used methods such as deprivation of food, physical decline, political indoctrination and betrayal among inmates. It is alleged that 278 out of 320 prisoners died during his years in the camp.
Boudarel returned to France in 1966 after benefiting from the amnesty law of 18 June 1966.
