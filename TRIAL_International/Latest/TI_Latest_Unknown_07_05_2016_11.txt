The detainees were held in extremely inhumane conditions and forced to do hard labor. They were also exposed to interrogations and physical mistreatment by prison guards and other soldiers who were freely entered the premises, as well as by Ružnić, who interrogated the prisoners of war.
For these alleged acts, Ružnić was arrested and detained in Sarajevo on 8 April 2008.
