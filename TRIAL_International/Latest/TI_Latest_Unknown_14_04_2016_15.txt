facts 

Abul Kalam Azad was born on 5 March 1947 and was a student at Rajendra College in Faridpur (now Bangladesh).
During the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971, he was a close associate of Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed, the then president of the East Pakistani student wing of Jamaat-e-Islamii, an Islamist political party which strongly opposed the independence of Bangladesh. Before the formation of the Razakar paramilitary force by the Pakistani army, Azad has allegedly actively aided the Pakistani army in committing criminal acts, mainly on the Hindu community and pro-liberation Bangalee people. Later on, Azad assisted the Pakistani army as a member of the Razakar paramilitary group and subsequently as the chief of Al-Badr, the paramilitary wing of the West Pakistani army in Faridpur. Azad is claimed to have committed murder, rape, torture, abduction of Hindu civilian population and looting of houses.
On 3 April 2012, Azad fled to India and went into hiding just hours before the Bangladesh International Crimes Tribunal 2 issued an arrest warrant.
