26.04.2018
The Bukavu military court has sentenced a Congolese policeman to 20 years of prison for raping two minors. The girls were assaulted while they were detained at the police station.
On 24 March 2017, Désirée, Victoire, and Renée (real names withheld), all three aged between 12 and 14 years old, were arrested and detained at Bidagwa police station. The first was accused of stealing a phone charger, the other two under suspicion of complicity.
Two policemen were at the station, including Mr. Mulumeoderwa Bahimba Muhiganya, nicknamed “Kadogo”. During the night, while his colleague was asleep, Kadogo went to see the detained. Under the guise that her parents had arrived, he took Désirée out of the cell and raped her. He then did the same to Victoire. Renée managed to escape him, shouting. As the policeman assaulted Désirée a second time, his colleague woke up and realized that the policeman was with the child.
