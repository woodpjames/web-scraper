facts

Jiro Minami was born in 1874. Embarking on a career in the military, he rose to the rank of General in 1931 and was even appointed Minister of War from April to December of the same year.
Minami did nothing to prevent the incident at Mukden (on 18 September 1931, the Japanese blew up one of their railway lines in China, accusing the Chinese of the crime, in order to gain a pretext to invade Manchuria), despite the fact that he was aware of the likelihood that it would occur. He took no measures to limit the extent of combat. On the contrary, he allowed the Japanese forces to broaden their military operations.
A fervent advocate of Japanese expansionism, he argued that Manchuria should be made part of Japan. From December 1934 to March 1936, he was Commander in Chief of the Kwantung Army and, in that capacity, carried out the final stages of the conquest of Manchuria, contributing to the exploitation of that area of China to Japanâ€™s benefit.
As Governor of Korea from 1936 to 1938, he played an active role in view of initiating war with China.
Arrested at the end of the war, Jiro Minami was charged on several counts, ranging from conspiracy to wage wars of aggression, participation in such wars, to war crimes.
