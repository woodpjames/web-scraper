facts

Branislav Medic, born in 1966, was a member of the “Scorpions”, a formation founded in the early 1990s as a paramilitary group widely believed to have enjoyed the protection of the Serbian security services. The group was active in Bosnia during the 1992-95 war and in Kosovo in the late 1990s. Its members were believed to have taken part in the capture of Srebrenica and the killing of up to 8,000 Muslim men and boys in July 1995.
Branislav Medic was incriminated by a video tape filmed by a member of the “Scorpions” which became public in summer 2005. The 20-minute video showed several members of the Scorpions unit ordering six young Bosnian prisoners, dressed in civilian clothes, from the back of a lorry. The victims were marched into nearby woodland and shot one by one. From the video footage it appeared that Branislav Medic could be seen executing at least one of the victims.
After the victims’ bodies had been exhumed, DNA analyses identified Azmir Alispahic, 17, Safet Fejzic, also 17, and Sadik Saltic, 36, while the families recognized Smail Ibrahimovic and Fadil Salkic in the footage. The identity of the sixth victim remains unknown.
Branislav Medic was arrested in June 2005, days after the footage was shown at the trial of former Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic (see “related cases”) at The Hague.
