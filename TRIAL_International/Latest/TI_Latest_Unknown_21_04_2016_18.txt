facts

María Estela Martínez de Perón, better known as Isabel Perón, was born in La Rioja, Argentina, on 4 February 1931. She worked as a dancer in a night club when she met former Argentine president Juan Domingo Perón, who had lost his second wife Eva (Evita) in 1952. The couple got married in 1961 during Perón’s Spanish exile.
After his return to Argentina, Juan Perón was re-elected president in 1973. His wife Isabel was made vice-president.
After less than one year in office, Perón died on 1 July 1974. Isabel quickly assumed his position to prevent elections. During her presidency, she was perceived as inexperienced in political matters and as a puppet of her late husband’s powerful companions.
The Peronists persecuted their opponents, often resorting to violence. Opposition groups reacted with increased use of violence on their part. Abductions and strikes were common during Isabel’s presidency, which ended in 1976 and was followed by a military dictatorship (time of the “dirty war”).
On 24 March 1976, Isabel Perón was put under house arrest. She was convicted of corruption in 1981, but released shortly afterwards and sent into exile in Spain.
Isabel Perón lives near Madrid in Spain and does no longer engage in political activity.
