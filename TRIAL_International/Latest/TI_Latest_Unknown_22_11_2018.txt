In June 2013, three villages in the Kalehe territory (South Kivu) were attacked by soldiers of the Congolese army (FARDC). The commander of that unit, accused of crimes against humanity, has received a life sentence from the Military Tribunal of South Kivu.
On 7 June 2013, at the market square of Katasomwa (Kalehe territory), cross-fire erupted between the soldiers of the FARDC and members of the armed group known as “Raia Mutomobki“ or “angry citizens”. The detention of a young man belonging to the militia flared the violent confrontation, which led to the death of FARDC soldier.
