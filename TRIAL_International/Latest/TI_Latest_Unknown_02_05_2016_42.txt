facts

Fritz Sauckel was born in October 1894 in Bamberg, in Bavaria.
Having joined the Nazi party in 1922, he became the Gauleiter for Franconia in 1925, then member of the Reichstag, the German parliament in 1933. In March 1942, his career took a decisive turn when Hitler named him as Plenipotentiary for the Mobilisation of Workers. He was from then on in overall charge of finding manpower both in Germany and in the occupied territories. These workers, whether willingly or by coercion, were to work for the German war effort. Sauckel was able to recruit more than 5 million workers throughout occupied Europe and also from amongst prisoners of war. According to one of his orders, “all the men must be fed, sheltered and treated in such a way as to exploit them to the highest possible extent at the lowest conceivable degree of expenditure”.
Sauckel was accused of having taken advantage of his various positions and his personal influence to facilitate the accession to power of the Nazi conspirators based on count 1 of the indictment. Sauckel was also accused of having participated in the economic preparations for wars of aggression according to counts 1 and 2 of the indictment. He authorised, supervised and took part in acts constituting war crimes, according to count 3 of the indictment and in crimes against humanity based on count 4, in particular for having coerced the inhabitants of the occupied territories into forced labour either in Germany or in the occupied territories.
Charged with counts 1 (common plan or conspiracy), 2 (crime against peace), 3 (war crimes) and 4 (crimes against humanity), Fritz Sauckel pleaded not guilty.
