Okot Odiambo was one of the key commanders of the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA), a rebel group which terrorized the civilian population in Northern Uganda (see “context“).
In April 2005, in the course of a reorganisation of the LRA’s four brigades, Okot Odiambo was reportedly promoted Major general, and named Army Commander of the LRA.
Odiambo was blamed for leading the LRA’s massacre at Barlonya camp in February 2004, when more than 300 people were burnt, shot and hacked to death.
He was reportedly coordinating raids on civilians in Kitgum district in March 2005.
Okot Odiambo and Major general Raska Lukwiya are both believed to be in southern Sudan with Joseph Kony, the Leader of the LRA.
