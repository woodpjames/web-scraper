facts

Doron Almog was born in Israel in 1951.
After training at military boarding school in Haifa, in 1969 he joined the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) as a volunteer in the Parachute Brigade where he held several command positions.
During his military career, including four wars, Almog gained extensive experience in combat and special clandestine operations such as air raids (War of Attrition after 1967), and as a company commander of paratroopers (Yom Kippur War and Operation Entebbe).
In 1991, he was appointed head of the infantry and paratroopers of the IDF.
In 1993, General Almog commanded the IDF forces in Gaza.
In 1996, he was appointed head of the division of the doctrine and training at the headquarters of IDF. In this context he led the development of a doctrinal framework in collaboration with a team from Pentagon.
In 1998, he was appointed corps commander and promoted to Major General.
Between 2000 and 2003, he managed the Southern Command of IDF whose mission was to defend the borders of Israel from Egypt and Jordan. In particular, he conducted various operations in Gaza. It was during this time that the alleged facts against him took place.
Almog is particularly suspected of ordering a retaliatory demolition of 59 Palestinian homes in the camp of Rafah (Gaza strip) on 10 January 2002.
Almog has allegedly committed other acts during his command of the Southern Israeli army from 8 January 2000 to 7 July 2003. These acts, classified as grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions, include the death of two persons, one of the victims being a pregnant woman, as well as dropping an exploding bomb over the city of Gaza killing 15 people and wounded 150 on 22 July 2002.
The Palestinian Centre for Human Rights (PCHR) filed a complaint of war crimes, on behalf of the victims living in Gaza, to the UK courts against General Almog under the principle of universal jurisdiction.
