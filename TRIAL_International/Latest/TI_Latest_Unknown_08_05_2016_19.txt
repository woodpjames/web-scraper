facts

Jovito Palparan was born on 11 September 1950 in Cagaynde Oro, the capital of the province of Misamis Oriental, Philippines.
He studied at the University of the East in Manila, where he earned a degree in business administration in 1971.
In 1973 Palparan joined the Armed Forces of the Philippines, first as a lieutenant in Basilan and Sulu and then as the commander of various units, including the 24th Infantry Battalion, known as the “torture battalion”.
In 2003, he was promoted to brigadier general and then to major general in 2004, after having served in the Philippine contingent in Iraq.
Palparan received many military decorations and medals of honour for his ‘achievements’ in the anti-insurrectional fight against the communist guerrilla in the Philippines.
On 11 September 2006, Palparan retired from his military career, over the course of which, it is estimated by the NGO Karaptan (the Alliance for the Advancement of People’s Rights) that he was involved in acts of torture, forced disappearance and numerous murders, including those of human rights activists.
In 2009, he won a seat in Congress as a representative of the Bantay party (an anti-communist party).
On 20 December 2011, a regional court in Bulacan issued an arrest warrant against Jovito Palparan for the abduction and illegal detention of two students from the University of the Philippines, who went missing in 2006. These students were Sherlyn Cadapan and Karen Empeño, supposed members of the communist party.
On 12 August 2014, after three years in hiding, Palparan was arrested by the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) in Santa Mesa, Manila.
