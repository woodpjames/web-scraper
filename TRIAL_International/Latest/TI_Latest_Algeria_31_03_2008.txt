New complaint to UN Human Rights Committee against Algeria
31.03.2008
The Advocacy Center – TRIAL (ACT) has submitted a fourth individual communication to the UN Human Rights Committee against Algeria. The case relates to the enforced disappearance of Mr Bouzid Mezine.

The Advocacy Center – TRIAL (ACT), representing Bouzid Mezine’s brother, lodged an individual complaint against Algeria before the United Nations Human Rights Committee in March 2008.
Mr. Mezine disappeared after having been arrested by members of the Algerian army, on 11 August 1996. Despite tireless efforts, his family never obtained any information regarding his fate or whereabouts from the national authorities.
The ACT requests the Human Rights Committee to declare that Algeria violated the fundamental rights of Mr. Bouzid Mezine as well as his brother’s, and that, as a result, redress should be granted.
