facts

Vlatko Jarak was a member of the Knez Domagoj First Brigade of the Croatian Defence Council (HVO).
It is alleged that, in carrying out his duties, Jarak with the HVO participated in the forcible resettlement and unlawful detention of Bosniaks from the Stolac municipality during July and August 1993.
Jarak is said to have tied the arms of three Bosniak civilians with barbed wire before taking them to be transported to Kostana hospital in Stolac. The hospital served as a point of transfer before the victims’ relocation to the Gabela detention camp near Capljina, known for the unlawful detention of Bosniaks.
Additionally, Jarak is said to have participated in the forcible resettlement of Bosniaks from Stolac to Blagaj. He allegedly took civilians from their homes and transferred them to several sites such as the school centre and the “TGA” Factory complex in Stolac. Here the civilian victims were deprived of food and water and had their valuables seized while in detainment. The men were then taken to an unknown location, believed to be detention camps, while the women and children were transferred to Blagaj.
The State Prosecution of Bosnia and Herzegovina charged Jarak with participation in war crimes namely forcible resettlement, unlawful detention and threatening of civilians. The indictment was confirmed in December 2010 and, upon a motion by the State Prosecution, the case was referred to the Cantonal Court in Mostar.
