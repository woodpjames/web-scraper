Switzerland: TRIAL submits its views on dictators' assets law
16.09.2013
TRIAL submits its views to the Swiss Government (the Federal Council) relating the project of a new federal law on the freezing and restitution of assets of illicit origin linked to politically exposed persons (LBVR).
Considering its limited mandate, namely the fight against impunity in cases of crimes under international law (genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, torture, enforced disappearance), TRIAL only commented on the aspects of the projected law that could influence the victims’ right to obtain reparation for the violations committed.
The organisation asked the Federal Council to modify the draft law so that only clear legal considerations linked to Switzerland’s international commitments in the fight against impunity and related to the rights of victims to obtain redress should prevail over purely political imperatives in order to freeze potentates’ assets in Switzerland. TRIAL also is of the view that victims and associations recognised by law should independently be authorised to initiate proceedings aimed at freezing and confiscating assets illicitly acquired by potentates.
