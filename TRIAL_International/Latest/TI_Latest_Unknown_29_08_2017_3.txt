Facts

Ntabo Ntaberi Sheka was born on 4 April 1976 in Walikale territory, North Kivu Province, in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
Sheka established himself as a mineral trader in mineral-rich Walikale. In 2009, he founded the Mayi Mayi Sheka (MMS), a Congo-based militia group composed mostly of Nyanga ethnics that operates in Walikale territory with the objective of promoting the interest of Nyanga people and protecting mineral mines in the area from government control. Sheka served as Commander-in-Chief of the of the Nduma Defense of Congo, the political branch of the MMS ever since.
Between 30 July and 2 August 2010, the MMS was engaged in military operations, under Shekaâ€™s command, against the Armed Forces of the DRC (FARDC) in and around the villages of Biruwe, Mabenga, Osokari, Kilambo, Kailenge, Boboro, Omate, Mubi, and those villages along the Kibua to Mpofi road in Walikale territory. During that time, almost 400 persons were abducted or subjected to forced labour and extreme violence, including of sexual nature, by members of rebel militias. In addition, private property in the villages was stolen.
