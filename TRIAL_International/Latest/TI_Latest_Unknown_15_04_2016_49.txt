Lucic was put on trial with 5 others: Mladen Govedorica, Boro Gligic, Zlatko Tarle, Ivo Manzalin and Ivo Gojnic. The six accused were Montenegrin and former officers of the Yugoslav People’s Army (JNA). They were put on trial in Montenegro at the Court of Podgorica for having ordered and committed torturous acts during the Croatian war (1990-1995) between October 1991 and August 1992 against prisoners and Croatian civilians. These acts took place within the Morinj detention centre in the region outside of Dubrovnik, South East Croatia.
The first ruling was announced on 15 May 2010; Lucic and his co-accused were found guilty of these crimes.
