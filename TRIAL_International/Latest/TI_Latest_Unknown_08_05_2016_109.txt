Donald Payne was born in 1971. He was former pupil in Mansfield High School and joined the military Regiment of Drums. He also had missions in Omagh in Northern Ireland. Payne was Corporal of the 1st Battalion of Queen’s Lancashire Regiment during the war against Iraq led by the United States and Great Britain.
In March 2003, after months of debate, the United States and Britain initiated the war on Iraq without the support of the U.N. Security Council. After four weeks, coalition ground and air forces surrounded and captured Baghdad and the Pentagon declared that major combat in Iraq was over.
Payne is alleged to have committed a number of offences against a group of detainees in Iraq following a planned operation.
In particular, he is alleged to have tortured and killed one of the detainees, Mr Baha D’oud Salim Mousa, a Basra hotel receptionist. The latter was father of two sons. Mousa was detained September 14, 2003, in the hotel he was working in. He was brought to the British army base. One of the employees of the hotel who was also detained by British soldiers said that Mousa had been tied up and that a hood had been slipped over him even though he told the soldiers that he wasn’t able to breath anymore. They continued to beat and tantalize him. Four days later, he finally died.Donald Payne is said to have urged anyone who was asked about Mousa’s dead to state that Mousa had banged his head and died accidentally.
Moreover he is alleged to have mistreated eight other detainees.
The British attorney general Lord Goldsmith announced July 19, 2004, that Corporal Donald Payne would be tried under the International Criminal Court Act 2001 on war crimes charges. Although charged under the mentioned Act, the serviceman will face court martial in Britain rather than being tried at The Hague.
