facts

Ramush Haradinaj was born on 3 July 1968 in Kosovo. In 1989, using a false name, he emigrated to Switzerland where he became an active member of the nationalist People’s Movement of Kosovo, the future Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA).
In 1996, he reportedly set up KLA bases in the cities of Kukes and Tropoje, in northern Albania, and organised arms smuggling into Kosovo. In 1997, he came back to his country and in March 1998 he became Commander of the KLA for western Kosovo.
He was reported to be one of the KLA “Black Eagles” special unit founder, which was suspected of torture and murder of Serbs and Kosovar Albanian civilians accused of collaborating with the Serbs.
On 24 March 1998, the KLA started a systematic campaign aimed at pushing Serbs, Roma and Albanians out of the Dukagjin area. The KLA forces, allegedly under direct command of Haradinaj, harassed, beat, expelled, abducted, detained, and tortured Serbian and Roma civilians from villages located in the region of Glodjane. During the campaign 25 Serbian policemen were targeted and more than 60 Serbian and Albanian civilians were abducted and subsequently executed between March and September 1998.
On 12 September 1998, the Serbian forensic police discovered the remains of dozens of victims, leading to public accusation of war crimes against Haradinaj and his forces.
In 2000, Haradinaj founded the party of the Alliance for the Future of Kosovo (AAK) and was Prime Minister of Kosovo between December 2004 and March 2005.
