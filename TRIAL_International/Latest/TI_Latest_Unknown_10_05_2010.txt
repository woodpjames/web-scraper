Nwaoga is a native of Ibagwa Nike, Nigeria.
During the civil war that took place in Nigeria between 1967 and 1970, Pius Nwaogajoined the rebel forces known as Biafran Army. He joined as a private and later become a lieutenant. He was deployed to Ibagwa Nike, which was, at that time, in the hands of the Federal troops.
Before July 1969, Nwaoga was posted in command of a rebel company to a town called Olo. In July 1969, he was summoned to Atta and instructed to lead two lieutenants to kill Robert Ngwu, who was also a soldier in the rebel forces.
Major Nwoye, who gave Nwaoga the instructions, told him the instructions had come down from the “State House”.
Nwaoga, in obedience to the instructions given him, took the two lieutenants who would eliminate Ngwu to Nike. They went to Robert Ngwu’s house and there, in the presence of Nwaoga, one of the lieutenants killed Robert Ngwu and another. They all ran away.
Pius Nwaoga was apprehended later and brought to trial.
