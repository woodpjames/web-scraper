facts

Herbert Veloza García was born in 1967 in the department of Valle, Colombia.
In 1994, Veloza joined the paramilitaries in the village of Villanueva, Cordoba, where he received military training.
In 1996, Veloza became the Turbo front of the Bananero Bloc commander, a paramilitary group, part of the “Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia (AUC)” (the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia), operating in the Urabá region with an economic interest in the banana industry. During this time, the Bananero Bloc is alleged to have committed various acts of killings and violence against banana growers and farmers as part of a systematic plan to strike, weaken, and obliterate the trade union movement.
In 2000, he assumed the command of the Calima block part of the AUC, a far right paramilitary group involved in illicit financial activities such as narcotrafficking and extortions, and whose objective was the elimination of Marxist guerrilla groups, more particularly the “Fuerzas armadas revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC)” (The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia). The AUC carried out several massacres against civilians perceived to collaborate with the leftist groups which led to the death of thousands of people.
In late 2004, the Bananeros and the Calima bloc were demobilised.
