Fred Bauma, a symbol of arbitrary detention in the DRC
03.06.2016
Fred Bauma is one of the most prominent figures of the LUCHA (standing for Lutte pour le Changement, the Fight for Change), a well-known NGO demanding democratic change in DRC. 
In March 2015, Fred was arrested by State agents during a peaceful demonstration in Kinshasa. Accused of inciting violence and rebellion, he was immediately placed in detention.
TRIAL International brought the case before the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, which in October 2015 declared his detention illegal and condemned the violations committed against him.

Despite the group’s recommendations, the Congolese authorities remained inflexible and arbitrarily detained Fred for over a year. 
In August 2016, the young activist was released following a Supreme Court order, but the charges against him are still pending.
