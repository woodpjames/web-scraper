Facts

The town of Mutarule is located in the Ruzizi plain in South Kivu. Two ethnics groups that populate the plain – the Bafuliro and the Barundi – have been for many years in conflict for land-holding, economic and political reasons.
During the summer 2013, the town of Mutarule was attacked by non-identified men. Houses were looted and several tens of people were killed. No investigation were carried out to identify the perpetrators of the crimes.
The night of 6 June 2014, men armed with war weapons attacked once again the town of Mutarule. This time they fired on the 200 civilians gathered in front of the Mutarule church. Others victims were stabbed and had their houses burned down. Approximately forty people died that night, mostly from Bafuliiru community.
Major Kayumba Nyenyeri, a military officer, was allegedly involved in these events.
