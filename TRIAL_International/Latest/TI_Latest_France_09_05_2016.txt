In 31 December 2003, the CIA abducted and detained a German citizen, Khaled El Masri. While El Masri was on vacation in Macedonia, the CIA mistook his identity with a member of Al Qaida that could provide them with information on possible threats on the US security. El Masri was then transported to Afghanistan where he was detained and questioned for four months under the direction of Bikowsky. At the time, she was deputy chief of the Central Intelligence Agency’s (CIA) Bin Laden Issue Station.
During his detention, El Masri was regularly interrogated, subjected to physical abuse, and humiliated. On 29 May 2004, he was sent back to Germany.
The German organization ECCHR filed a complaint on 19 October 2015 in Germany against Bikowsky. They sought before the enforcement of thirteen arrest warrants against former CIA officials, which were involved in El Masri’s abduction in Skopje and flight to Kabul.
