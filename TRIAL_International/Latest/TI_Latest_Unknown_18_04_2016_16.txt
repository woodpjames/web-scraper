facts

Raska Lukwiya was a high-ranking commander of the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA), a rebel group which terrorized the civilian population in Northern Uganda (see “ontext“).
In April 2005, in the course of a reorganisation of the LRA’s four brigades, Raska Lukwiya was reportedly promoted from Brigadier to Major General and put in charge of supplies and logistics.
During Uganda’s operation Iron Fist in 2002, it was believed that Raska Lukwiya was killed. However, he survived and is today believed to be located near the Sudanese town of Liria in southern Sudan, together with Joseph Kony. In March 2004, he and his group were bombarded by the Ugandan army, whereby his Major James Ojok, his closest aide, his wife and one of his sons were killed, while six other members of his family were captured, including his youngest son.
