facts

Arturo Moreno Alcántara was born in Lima in 1954 and graduated in 1973. He became Chief of the anti-subversion section of the Peruvian intelligence services. This mandate made him responsible for the planning and execution of military operations in the region of Ayacucho and, amongst others, in the Los Cabitos barracks, the operational centre of Ayachucho’s political and military command from the end of 1982. This was the main centre of imprisonment, torture, enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings in Peru, especially from 1983 to 1985.
In 1983, thousands of people were detained, brought to the military barracks and tortured. These detainees were accused of being members of the Shining Path, a terrorist organization of Marxist, Leninist and Maoist ideology, who was trying to replace the Peruvian institutions with a communist peasant revolutionary regime. The mere fact of being a teacher, a student or a trader was enough to be suspected of being part of the Shining Path.
As part of the investigation of crimes committed in the Los Cabitos barracks, hundreds of bodies have been exhumed, many of them bearing signs of torture and execution with firearms. Crematoria were also discovered and many other bodies were incinerated here in 1985 to erase any evidence of the crimes committed in this military base between 1983 and 1985.
In July 2001, a Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) was established to investigate armed violence in Peru between 1980 and the 2000s. In its final report, published on 28 August 2003, the TRC recommended that Moreno Alcántara and six other military leaders be prosecuted for the enforced disappearance and torture of 54 people in Los Cabitos in 1983.
