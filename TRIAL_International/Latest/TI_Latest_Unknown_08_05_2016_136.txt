facts


Goran Vujovic is originally from the Bileća region in Bosnia and Herzegovina. He was the head of the public security station in Bileća throughout the Bosnian war and remained in the position until he was removed in September 2002 by the International Police Task Force (IPTF).
Vujovic was investigated and later indicted for events that took place from the beginning of June until the end of December 1992, during the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, when members of the public security station in Bileća mistreated and tortured Bosnian and Croatian civilians because of their nationality or religious beliefs.
Vujovic is accused, along with Miroslav Duka who was the militia commander in the Bileća public security station, of unlawful confinement, deportation, murder, torture and physical and psychological abuse of the civilian Bosnian and Croat population in the wider area of the municipality of Bileća in 1992. These acts took place in the premises of the public security station and student dormitories used as ad hoc detention centres in Bileća and formed part of a widespread and systematic attack of the military, police and paramilitary of the Serb Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (later known as Republika Srpska) directed against the Bosnian and Croatian population.
The Prosecutor of the Special Department for War Crimes within the Prosecutor’s Office of Bosnia and Herzegovina indicted Vujovic together with Duka in December 2013. Vujovic’s trial began on 17 June 2014. He is tried alongside co-defendants Duka, Zeljko Ilic and Nedjeljko Kuljic, both police officers.
