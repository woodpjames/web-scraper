facts

Velimir Popovic was a member of the Military Police of the Republika Srpska Army.
The events that led to the conviction of Popovic occurred between May and June 1992. It is alleged that he and other members of the Military Police physically and mentally tortured Croat and Bosniak prisoners of war in the Stari and Novi Uglijevik detention camps. Former prisoners claimed that Popovic had physically beaten them and forced them to perform other acts of abuse, including sexual acts on each other. Popovic in collaboration with other members of the Military Police are believed to have taken the prisoners from the detention facilities at the Stari Uglijvek transitional camp and school building in Uglijvek for examination where the alleged acts of abuse were then committed.
Charges for the said abuses were brought against Popovic along with two other co-accused, Ostoja Minic and Oliver Rodic in the District Court of Bijeljina. This case marked the first referral by the Prosecutorâ€™s Office of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the Court in Bijeljina.
