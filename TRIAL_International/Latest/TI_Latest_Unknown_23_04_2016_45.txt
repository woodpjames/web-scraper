facts

Lajos Polgar was born in Hungary in 1916. He was a former member of the Arrow Cross Party, a fascist, pro-German and anti-Semitic political party. The Arrow Cross was established by Ferenc Szalasi, who became Prime Minister in replacement of admiral Horthy after the German army invasion of Hungary on 19 March 1944.
The Arrow Cross played an active role in the deportation of millions of Jews. The party’s headquarters known as the “House of Loyalty” were allegedly used for the torture and killing of Jews, which mainly took place in the basement.
Judiciary files from 1940 showed that Lajos Polgar took numerous decisions that led to the massacre and persecution of Hungarian Jews.
After the war, many members of the Arrow Cross were tried, as were Nazi criminals. However, some of them, such as Polgar, were able to flee. Lajos Polgar arrived in Australia in 1949. He changed his identity, naming himself Jozsef Kardos, and never mentioned his past. He subsequently befriended the family of the former Australian Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser. In 1957, he again used his real name before acquiring the Australian citizenship in 1958.
Suspecting Polgar of genocide and war crimes, the Hungarian authorities opened an investigation, which was entrusted to the National Office of Investigations of Budapest.
