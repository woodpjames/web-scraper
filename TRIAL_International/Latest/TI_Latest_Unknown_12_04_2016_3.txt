facts

Justus Majyambere was born in 1966 in Mbarara, Uganda. He was an officer in the Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA) before joining the Rwanda Defence Forces where he currently has the rank of Major.
From 1994 to 1997, as he was a senior intelligence officer in the RPA, Majyambere allegedly commanded over widespread and systematic attacks against Hutus populations in the region of Ruhengeri and notably allegedly ordered the killing 10’000 persons in the vicinity of Nyakinama. In what appears to be an attempt to suppress any testimonies about these attacks, Majyambere also allegedly directed the execution on 18 January 1997 in the city of Ruhengeri of three Spanish members of the non-governmental organization “Médicos del Mundo” : Flors Sirera, Manuel Madrazo and Luis Valtueňa. An American citizen – Nithin Mahdav – was also injured in the attack.
On 22 February 2005, the prosecutor Jose Luis Ferrer Recuero filed a complaint before the Spanish Audiencia Nacional, on behalf of families of victims and associations, against Charles Musitu and 40 officers of the Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA) for their involvement in the death of Spanish missionaries and relief workers and for other crimes committed between 1990 and 2002 in Rwanda.
On 8 April 2005, Judge Andreu from the Audiencia Nacional decided to open an investigation against members of the RPA. From 28 February 2006, the judge started to hear witnesses.
On 6 February 2008, the judge of the Spanish Audiencia Nacional indicted Majyambere and 39 others and issued warrants of arrest.
