Octavien Ngenzi was born in 1954 in Rwanda. In 1994, during the Rwandan Genocide, Ngenzi was mayor of the Kabarondo district in the East of the country, and he was the local leader of the former political party, the “National Republican Movement for Development and Democracy” (MNRD).
In 2009, Kigali issued an international arrest warrant against Ngenzi, who was suspected of having ordered and headed several massacres in the Kibungo province. Most notably, Ngenzi allegedly participated to the massacre of the Kabarondo church on 13 April 1994, where close to one thousand Tutsis were murdered by Hutu militia. He allegedly organised and lead the Interahamwe milicia, armed with machetes, toward the Kabarondo church.
