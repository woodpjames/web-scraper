facts

Miljenko Bajic was born on 22 January 1966. He was a guard at Lora Military Prison in Croatia during the time the crimes he is being held for were committed.
Between March and September 1992, Miljenko and seven of his colleagues, Timoslav Duic, Davor Banic, Anto Gudic, Andelko Botic, Tonce Vrkic, Josip Bicik and Emilio Bungur, all members of the 72nd regiment of the Croatian Military Police, allegedly tortured and killed two Serbian civilians living in Croatia. They then went on to torture several other civilians and prisoners of war, also Serbians, in the Lora Military prison.
Since the late 1990s human rights activists have denounced the mass arrests and the captivity of hundreds of Serbian civilians and soldiers at the Lora prison. These people were suspected of preparing an “armed rebellion against Croatia” and equally Croatian soldiers were declared “enemies of the Republic.”
It is one of the most grim parts of the Croatian war of independence that lasted from 199 to 1995. The victims, the majority of whom were members of the popular Yugoslavian army (JNA), were said to have been subjected to numerous cruel tortures.
Seven out of the eight accused were arrested in September 2001, including Bajic, however the former military prison commander Tomislav Duic had fled.
Bajic’s trial and that of his seven co-defendants was opened on 10 June 2002 before the Split District Court in Croatia.
