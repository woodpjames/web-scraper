Facts

Slavko Savic was member of a military brigade from the Republika Srpska in the Vogosca region, near Sarajevo.
According to the indictment, Savic allegedly entrered with a gun in the house of a bosnian woman and her daughter in Semizovac (Vogosca region). While threatening them, he compelled the woman to go out of her house and get in his car in order to rape her. These events happened twice, in May and June 1993, in front of the womanâ€™s eleven-years-old daughter. The woman got pregnant after the first rape. The indictment alleged that the woman has been targeted because of her bosnian origin.
In September 2014, Savic was arrested but quickly put in probation until his trial.
