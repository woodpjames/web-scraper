In 2018, Shabunda territory (South Kivu) was overrun with serious crimes that have still gone unpunished. To put a stop to this injustice, TRIAL International has joined the United Nations in its efforts to restore the rule of law.
The Shabunda Action Plan was launched on Saturday March 23, 2019 in Kigulube, in Shabunda territory, eastern DRC. The goal of this multisectoral plan is to enhance the protection of civilians and restore the authority of the State.
Several organizations are involved in implementing the plan, which will be extended to the entire Shabunda territory, including the OCHA, the HCR, various MONUSCO sections, experts from TRIAL International and the Panzi Foundation, military judges, and civilian representatives of the Congolese government.
The Shabunda Action Plan calls for developing a plan to protect victims and witnesses, improving early warning mechanisms, and raising the awareness of local partners and influential figures. Joint investigations are also foreseen, as well as training on Human Rights protection mechanisms for members of the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (FARDC) and the National Congolese Police (PNC).

TRIAL International contributes to the Action Plan by documenting crimes committed in and near Kigulube and by providing legal assistance to the hundreds of victims affected.
The work of TRIAL International on this case was conducted under the framework of the Task Force of International Criminal Justice, an informal network of international actors who collaborate in order to support the work of the Congolese military tribunals in the investigation and prosecution of mass crimes in the DRC.
