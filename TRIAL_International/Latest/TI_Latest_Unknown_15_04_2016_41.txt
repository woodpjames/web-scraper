facts

Almir Sabancevic, of Bosnian origin, was a supporter of Fikret Abdic. Abdic was a politician and Bosnian businessman who, from the beginning of the 1990s made known his opposition to the official government of Bosnia-Herzegovina. On 23 September 1993, Abdic proclaimed an Autonomous Province of Western Bosnia covering territory which encompassed the towns of Velika Kladusa and Cazin. This mini state existed until 1995 and became the ally of the army of the Sprska Republic. In 2002 Abdic was accused of war crimes against Bosniaks supporting the official government of Bosnia. A Croatian Court sentenced him to twenty years imprisonment. On appeal, the Croatian Supreme Court reduced the sentence to fifteen years. He was released on 9 March 2012 after having served two thirds of his sentence.
As soon as the Autonomous region was declared tensions arose between the supporters of Fikret Abdic and members of the 5th division of the armed forces of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Almir Sabancevic joined the armed forces of the Autonomous region around 20 March 1994. He was a member of the commando unit called “Falcon”. On 19 July 1995, he participated in the capture of 6 members of the 5th division of the army of Bosnia-Herzegovina in the village of Johovica.
He was accused of having committed war crimes including torture of prisoners of war and murder of one prisoner of war during the period when these six members of the 5th division of the army of Bosnia-Herzegovina captured in Johovica were being held.
On 31 March 1996 Sabancevic was arrested in Cazin and subsequently transferred to Bihac where he was remanded in custody.
