facts

José Mauricio Rodríguez Sánchez was born in 1946 in Guatemala. He served as Director of Military Intelligence (G-2) between April 1982 and April 1983 under the de facto government of Efrain Rios Montt. In his role as director of the G-2, he served directly under Army Chief of Staff Hector Mario López Fuentes and Minister of Defense Oscar Humberto Mejía Víctores – the second and third in command under Efrain Rios Montt. During this time, the national army together with paramilitary forces launched a series of military operations aimed at the country’s indigenous population.
Rodríguez Sánchez is allegedly one of the intellectual authors of military counter-insurgency campaigns between 1982 and 1983, detailed in the military documents Plan Victoria 82, Plan Sofia and Plan Firmeza 83, that resulted in the widespread killings of Maya Ixil people and in mass forced displacement. Rodríguez Sánchez supposedly signed these documents and thus knew about the various counter-insurgency campaign plans and operations of the national army.
In 2001, the Center for Human Rights Legal Action (Centro Para la Accion Legal en Derechos Humanos, or CALDH), a leading Guatemalan NGO, and human rights lawyer Edgar Pérez, of the Bufete Juridico de Derechos Humanos en Guatemala, initiated a complaint with the Public Ministry in 2001 seeking the investigation and prosecution of the commanders responsible for the violations committed in 1982 and 1983, during Guatemala’s civil war.
On 12 October 2011, an arrest warrant was issued for Rodríguez Sánchez and he was arrested the same day.
