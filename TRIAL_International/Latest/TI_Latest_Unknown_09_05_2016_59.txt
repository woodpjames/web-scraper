Gojko Granic was a member of the Croatian Defense Council (HVO) military police, the main military force of Croats in Bosnia, during the Bosnian War.
It is alleged that Granic, who was accompanied by other members of the HVO used to beat detainees in Dretelj detention centre.
Mustafa Dizdar, former member of the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina, who was captured and taken to Dretelj, was regularly beaten. According to witnesses, after lunch at the detention centre, detainees were lined up in Dretelj and had to lie on the concrete floor, where they would be beaten with boots by soldiers.
Detainees were allegedly also forced to eat from an aluminum bowl on the concrete floor, were given just one glass of water and had to finish the lunch in seconds. Detainees were forced to lie down on asphalt and had to jump over other prisoners according to a sequence. Prisoners were also forced to look at the sun for a long time.
On 16 April 2013, the Cantonal court in Mostar, Bosnia, confirmed an indictment against Granic, charging him with having committed war crimes against Bosniak civilians and prisoners of war, who were held in Dretelj detention camp, during 1993.
