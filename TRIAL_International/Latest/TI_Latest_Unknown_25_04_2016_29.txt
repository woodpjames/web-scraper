facts


Abdullah Al-Senussi was born on 5 December 1949 in Sudan. He is the brother-in-law of Muammar Gaddafi who ruled Libya from 1969 to 2011 by marrying a sister of Gaddafi’s second wife, Safia Farkash.
He was chief of Libya’s Military Intelligence until at least 20 February 2011 and part of Gaddafi’s entourage.
He is allegedly implied in the following terrorist attacks and massacres:
– In 1996, prisoners at Abu Salim prison in Tripoli protested to demand better conditions and fairer trials. Al-Senussi is accused of having violently responded to this protest by ordering the killing of 1’200 prisoners.
– On 21 December 1988, a Boeing 747 blew up over Lockerbie (Scotland), killing all 259 passengers and 11 persons on the ground. Al-Senussi allegedly hired Abdel Basset Ali Al-Megrahi who was found guilty of orchestrating the bombing and sentenced to life imprisonment in 2001.
– On 19 September 1989, UTA Flight 772 blew up over the Sahara desert in Niger killing 170 people, including 54 French. In March 1999, the French criminal Court of Paris (Cour d’Assises de Paris) found Al-Senussi guilty of masterminding this operation. He was sentenced in absentia to life imprisonment.
– On 15 February 2011, after the Tunisian and Egyptian revolutions, about 500 demonstrators gathered in front of the police headquarters in Benghazi protesting against the arrest of Fathi Terbil, a Libyan lawyer representing relatives of prisoners allegedly massacred at Abu Salim prison. Senussi allegedly ordered the violent response against the demonstrators. Hundreds of them were killed, injured, arrested and imprisoned.
On 26 February 2011, the United Nations Security Council referred the situation in Libya to the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) who decided to open an investigation on 3 March 2011. On 16 May 2011, the ICC Prosecutor requested the issuance of arrest warrants for Muammar Gaddafi, Saif Al-Islam Gaddafi and Abdullah Al-Senussi. Pre-Trial Chamber I of the ICC issued those three arrest warrants on 27 June 2011. Al-Senussi was thus charged with the crimes against humanity of murder and persecution, committed in Benghazi from 15 February 2011 until at least 28 February 2011.
