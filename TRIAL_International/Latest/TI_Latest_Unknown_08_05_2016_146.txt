facts


Zdenko Magoč was born in 1964 in Croatia. Magoč is a Croatian Serb and, before the Croatian War of Independence, he worked for a local cooperative as a combine harvester operator.
Magoč was a member of a Croatian Serb paramilitary group called Štaba teritorijalne obrane Mikluševci, meaning Mikluševci defence forces. The paramilitary group was associated with the Yugoslav People’s Army during the occupation of Mikluševci in Croatia from 8 October 1991 to 18 May 1992 during the Croatian War of Independence. The paramilitary group was allegedly led by Jugoslav Mišljenović.
During the occupation of the village of Mikluševci, inhabited mostly by Ruthenians but also by Croats and Serbs, the members of the Mikluševci defence forces harassed, intimidated, robbed and persecuted non-Serbs (Croats and the local Ruthenian minority).
In the verdict of the case against Jugoslav Mišljenović et al. it was proven that Peter Lenđer and Jovo Cico, two members of the paramilitary group, killed the members of a Ruthenian family Julijan, Veronika and Mihajlo Holik in the Jelaš woods near Mikluševci village. Magoč allegedly aided and abetted the crime by transporting the bodies of the dead as ordered.
On 18 May 1992, Magoč, armed, took part in forcing written statements upon 98 villagers standing before the school building in Mikluševci, to declare that they would leave the village, leaving behind all property, personal belongings and valuables as well as money to the authorities of the Serbian Autonomous District Krajina (“SAO Krajina”).
The Vukovar Police Administration initiated criminal investigations on 19 January 1993.
