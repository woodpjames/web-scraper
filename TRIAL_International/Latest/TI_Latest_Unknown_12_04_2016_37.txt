Carlos Briceño Zevallos was born on 24 April 1927, he is married to María Carpio and has four children.
In 1945, he joined the Chorrillos Military School and graduated as a second lieutenant of the infantry in 1949. He took various further training courses, including in command and general staff studies (at the War College) and in intelligence (at the Intelligence School). Among other titles, Briceño held the positions of Chief of Staff in the Fourth Military Region of Cusco in 1973, Brigadier General in 1977 and Inspector General of the Army in 1981. From 1 January 1983 to 31 December of the same year, he was General of the Army.
In this role, Briceño was responsible for planning and carrying out military operations in the Ayacucho region, including at the “Los Cabitos” military base. This was the operating base for the Military Political Command (CPM) from the end of 1982 and, particularly from 1983 to 1985, was the main base used for imprisonment, torture, disappearances and extrajudicial killings in Peru. In 1983, thousands of people were detained and taken to military bases where they were tortured, accused of being part of the Shining Path (Sendero Luminoso) terrorist organisation that had a Marxist, Leninist and Maoist ideology and looked to replace Peruvian institutions with a revolutionary, peasant communist regime. Just being a teacher, student or business-person was enough to be suspected of being part of the Shining Path.
As part of investigations into the crimes committed at the Los Cabitos military base, hundreds of bodies were exhumed and many of them showed signs of having been tortured and executed with firearms. Crematoria were also discovered and it is suspected that many more bodies were incinerated from 1985 in order to delete all evidence of the crimes committed at the base between 1983 and 1985.
In July 2001, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (CVR) was created to investigate the armed violence seen in Peru between 1980 and 2000. In its final report, published on 28 August 2003, the CVR recommended bringing the Los Cabitos case to trial and charging Briceño and six other senior military officers with the enforced disappearance and torture of 54 people at Los Cabitos in 1983.
