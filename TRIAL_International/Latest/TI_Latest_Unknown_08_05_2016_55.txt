Idhan Sipić was born on 9 April 1967 in Banja Luka, Bosnia and Herzegovina. He was a member of the Reconnaissance and Sabotage Commando Company, which was part of the 5th Corps of the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
During the war in Bosnia in the early 1990s, and during the so-called ‘Sana’ Operation (a military offensive undertaken by the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina in western Bosnia and Herzegovina against the Army of Republika Srpska to gain territory control) on an unspecified day in mid-September 1995 and in the territory of the Kljuc Municipality, Sipić entered the house of an elderly woman, Anja Banjac, of Serb ethnicity, and immediately attacked her with the intention of slitting her throat. Sipić, knowing that Banjac was a civilian and intending to kill her, pulled a bayonet and stabbed Banjac, causing her death.
Sipić surrendered on 21 November 2007 to the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
