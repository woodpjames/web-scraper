In his capacity as Chief of Staff on an interim basis, Radivoje Miletic was the main advisor to the commander and the main intermediary through whom the intentions, orders and directives of the commander were managed and processed with a view to their execution by the general staff and their subordinate units. As such, Radivoje Miletic would have had knowledge of the project aimed at forcing the Muslim population out of the Srebrenica and Zepa enclaves, and would have participated in the execution of this project.
According to the indictment, Radivoje Miletic, together with other VRS and MUP officers named in the indictment, was a member of, and knowingly participated in, a joint criminal enterprise, the common purpose of which was, among other things, to forcibly transfer the women and children from the Srebrenica enclave to Kladanj on 12 and 13 July 1995 and to capture, detain, summarily execute by firing squad, bury, and rebury thousands of Bosnian Muslim men and boys aged 16 to 60 from the Srebrenica enclave between 12 July 1995 until 19 July 1995.
The joint criminal enterprise, in which Radivoje Miletic was a member and participant, was conceived and designed by General Ratko Mladic and others on 11 and 12 July 1995, and administered and carried out by members of the VRS and MUP forces through the attack on the Srebrenica enclave.
During the several days following the attack on Srebrenica, the Bosnian Serb Army and Ministry of the Interior forces captured, detained, summarily executed, and buried over 7,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys from the Srebrenica enclave, and forcibly transferred the Bosnian Muslim women and children of Srebrenica out of the town.
