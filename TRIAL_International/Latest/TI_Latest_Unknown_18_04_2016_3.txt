Jorge Luis Magnacco, a medical doctor, was the Captain of the Argentinian navy. He worked as an obstetrician in the military hospital and Mitre clinic in Buenos Aires.
During the military regime ruling the country from 1976 to 1983, there existed a plan (the “Plan Sistemático”) designed at the highest level of government to kidnap, hide and rename the children of people detained and disappeared during the dictatorship.
The illegal appropriation of children was part of a systematic plan by the military dictatorship and police officials, determined to remove the trace of armed leftist guerilla movement who were seen as threatening the future of the country.
Some of the captured people were pregnant women held in clandestine maternity wards, including at the Navy School of Mechanics ( Escuela de Mecánica de la Armada – ESMA), where Magnacco was in charge of deliveries.
The plan involved snatching babies from their mothers, while they were in captivity. The babies were then disappeared or killed. The babies that were not killed were afterwards handed over to military families.
The suspected role of Magnacco was his involvement in these child births, with the knowledge of the existence of the said plan.
A trial regarding the appropriation of children, which involved several accused, including Magnacco, started on 28 February 2011.
