facts 

Zoran Babic was born on 1 June 1968. During the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, he was Deputy Chief of the Public Security Center in Prijedor.
In August 1992, Bosnia and Herzegovina was the theatre of an armed conflict. Within this framework, a widespread and systematic attack was launched against the non-Serb civilian population of the municipality of Prijedor.
On 21 August 1992, a group of non-Serb prisoners, detained in the Trnopolje concentration camp, were informed that they would be “exchanged” and transported to Travnik. That same morning, several hundreds – perhaps over a thousand – civilian men, women and children gathered in the village of Tukovi. They had been told that a convoy would be organized that day to Travnik.
The two groups of vehicles from Tukovi and Trnopolje joined into one convoy at the town of Kozarac and proceeded in the direction of Travnik. After having driven for a while, the convey stopped in a wooden area where the military-aged non-Serb men were separated from the women, children and elderly. The group of non-Serb men were then driven to a location called Korecanske Stijene where there is a sheer rock face on one side of the road and a steep cliff on the other. Prisoners were ordered to leave the bus with their heads down and to kneel at the edge of the cliff. It is reported that the police then started firing at the men. Apart from twelve persons who survived the massacre, it is estimated that more than 200 men were killed.
Zoran Babic is suspected of having taken part in this event.
On 27 May 2008, he was arrested by the Bosnian State Protection and Investigation Agency (SIPA) along with Zeljko Stojnic, Damir Ivankovic and Dusan Kankovic by the Bosnian State Protection and Investigation Agency (SIPA) on charges of crimes against humanity.
