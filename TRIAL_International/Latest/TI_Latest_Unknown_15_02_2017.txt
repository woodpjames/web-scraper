Equal rights for victims, regardless of where they are
15.02.2017
Significant victories have been achieved on victims’ right to reparation. Unfortunately, that right is unevenly applied throughout the country. 
18 months ago, Ana B. was the first victim to be granted compensation as part of a criminal proceeding. A significant precedent which paved the way for other survivors: since then, 4 more cases have entrenched this practice before the Court of BiH.
Unfortunately, lower courts have been slower to follow that example. Although TRIAL can boast one precedent (before the Doboj Court in September 2016), awareness is still sorely lacking.
“Victims should be able to uphold their right for compensations everywhere, regardless of where they seek justice” says Adrijana Hanusic Becirovic, Senior Legal Advisor at TRIAL.  “It is crucial that lower courts in both BiH entities follow the precedents we have set, or there will be double measures and inequality of treatments.”
