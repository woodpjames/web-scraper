facts

Dragan Ćirić was a member of the Territorial Defense Forces of the Yugoslav Republic (TDF) in the Vukovar region in Croatia. This military unit, together with the Yugoslav People’s Army (YPA), fought against the forces of the Republic of Croatia on behalf of the Serbian minority which was seeking to secede from the Republic of Croatia between August 1991 and May 1992.
During that time, non-Serbs living in the Vukovar region were subjected to violence and forcibly evicted from their houses by TDF and YPA’s members. These acts were allegedly committed on behalf of the self-proclaimed government of the Serb Autonomous Region of Krajina with the object of expelling the non-Serb population and to exterminate them.
On 18 May 1992, 98 residents of the Miklusevci village- under the control of Serbs military- were robbed and forced under severe threat of violence to leave their houses by TDF members. During these incidents, four civilians were killed and six civilians were subjected to torture and extreme violence.
