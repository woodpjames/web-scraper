TRIAL files its sixth complaint against Algeria before UN Human Rights Committee
27.05.2008
The Advocacy Center – TRIAL (ACT) has submitted a sixth individual communication to the UN Human Rights Committee against Algeria. The case relates to the enforced disappearance of Mr Djaafar SAHBI.

The Advocay Center – TRIAL (ACT), representing Djaafar Sahbi’s mother, lodged an individual complaint against Algeria before the United Nations Human Rights Committee in May 2008.
Mr. Sahbi disappeared after having been arrested by members of the Algerian police, on 3rd  July 1995. His family, despite tireless efforts, never obtained from the national authorities any information regarding his fate or whereabouts.
The ACT requests the Human Rights Committee to declare that Algeria violated the fundamental rights of Djaafar Shabi as well as his mother’s, and that, as a result, redress should be granted.
