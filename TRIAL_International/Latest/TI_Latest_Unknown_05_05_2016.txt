facts

Vujadin Popovic was born on 14 March 1957, in the village of Popovici, in the municipality of Sekovici (Bosnia-Herzegovina). During the attack of the Srebrenica enclave, Vujadin Popovic was lieutenant-colonel and assistant of the chief of the security of the Drina’s corps of the Bosnian Serbs Army (VRS). He was present and in working order in the area of responsibility of Drina Corps, which included Srebrenica, Potocari, Bratunac and Zvornik, from 11 July to 31 August 1995.
As assistant of the chief of the security of Drina Corps, he was in charge, in particular, of the Bosnian Muslim prisoners of Srebrenica between 11 July and, at least, 1st November 1995.
According to the indictment, Vujadin Popovic, together with other VRS and interior ministry (MUP) officers and units, was a member of and knowingly participated in a joint criminal enterprise, the common purpose of which was, among other things, to forcibly transfer the women and children from the Srebrenica enclave to Kladanj on 12 July and 13 July 1995; and to capture, detain, summarily execute by firing squad, bury, and rebury thousands of Bosnian Muslim men and boys aged 16 to 60 from the Srebrenica enclave from 12 July 1995 until 19 July 1995. The initial plan was to execute summarily more than 1’000 Bosnian Muslim, men and children aged 16 to 60, who were separated of the group of Potocari. On 12 July, the plan was expanded to the execution of more than 6’000 men and children aged 16 to 60, captured amongst the column of men escaping from the Srebrenica enclave between 12 and 19 July 1992. Most of these persons were captured along the road connecting Bratunac to Milici, on 13 July 1995.
The joint criminal enterprise, of which Vujadin Popovic was a member and participant, was conceived by general Ratko Mladic and his accomplices, on 11 and 12 July 1992, and was carried out by members of the VRS and MUP forces.
During several days following the attack on Srebrenica, the Bosnian Serb army and ministry of interior forces captured, detained, summarily executed, and buried over 7’000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys from the Srebrenica enclave, and forcibly transferred the Bosnian Muslim women and children of Srebrenica out of the enclave.
Vujadin Popovic voluntarily surrendered on 14 April 2005 and was transferred to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) on the same day.
