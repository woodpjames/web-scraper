Before being murdered, the victim had written a letter and recorded himself to document the threats he had been receiving from de Moraes.
De Moraes, one of the most powerful, rich and influential politicians in the state of Alagoas, was put on trial alongside Ananias de Lima and Geraldo Augusto Santos Silva, two military police officers who were accused of carrying out the crime.
