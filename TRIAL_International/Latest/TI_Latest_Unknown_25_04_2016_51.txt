Ladislav Niznansky was born in 1917 near the town of Cadca in Slovakia.
In 1917, at the age of 21, he graduated from the military Academy in Hranice Morave. He then went on to assume the rank of lieutenant.
During the first half of 1939 he joined the newly formed Slovak army. He was swiftly promoted to the rank of captain and served in the artillery forces in Zilina in the north-west of Slovakia.
In 1944, in line with other insurrections breaking out in neighbouring countries against the Nazi regime, a guerrilla movement gradually gained in strength and scope in Slovakia. The Slovakian president, Josef Tiso, at the head of a clerical-fascist government, had the Nazi troops brought in to put an end to the movement. On 29 August 1944, the entry of the Nazi troops, in particular the SS-Jagdverband Südost, heralded the beginning of the Slovak national insurrection which was to last until April 1945. From this point, the SS troops split up into several individual units. The largest of these units, the Frontaufsklärungstrupp 218 (code name “Edelweiss”) was put under the command of Niznansky from November 1944 onwards.
The hunting down of resistance fighters and Jews by the Edelweiss unit was characterised by extreme brutality. It carried out different massacres in several regions, including one in central Slovakia in 1945.
On 21 January 1945, together with reinforcements from other units in Slovakia, the Edelweiss unit set alight the communes of Klak and Ostry Grun in the Zarnovica district, causing the death of 146 persons amongst which were 56 women and 46 children. Commander Niznansky reportedly gave the order to encircle the villages so that no-one would be able to escape and was also said to have killed personally some 20 persons.
Likewise, on 7 February 1945, Niznansky was said to have ordered the execution of 18 Jewish civilians in Ksinna. More precisely, He was reported to have organised a firing squad, ordering his men to fire on the Jews who had taken refuge in underground bunkers.
The Edelweiss unity went out of existence with the arrival of the Red Army on 20 April 1945.
Commander Ladislav Niznansky was captured by the Soviet troops and transported to Neuhausen camp in Germany in May 1945.
Niznansy was considered to be one of the major war criminals in Slovakia, and was put on trial in Bratislava in 1946.
