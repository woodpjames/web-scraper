Promoting Accountability through the Human Rights Bodies in Geneva
New TRIAL and ICJ publication shows how Geneva-based UN human rights bodies can be used more effectively to combat impunity.
At a side event at the UN Human Rights Council 24th session, TRIAL and the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) presented yesterday their newest publication on  opportunities for Geneva-based human rights bodies to tackle impunity and to promote accountability of individuals responsible for crimes under international law and gross human rights violations.
 
The publication Promoting Accountability through the Human Rights Bodies in Geneva focuses on bodies such as the Human Rights Council, the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), Special Procedures and Treaty Bodies.
The report proposes measures through which States, civil society and other stakeholders can better engage the Human Rights Council and other Geneva-based human rights mechanisms promoting better accountability, ensuring that: 

The Human Rights Council focuses more consistently on accountability, for instance through the introduction of a periodic resolution on international justice and accountability and with greater attention given to international criminal law and the International Criminal Court;
Accountability-related action points are systematically taken up by the Human Rights Council in thematic and country-specific resolutions, as well as in recommendations made within the UPR mechanism;
Ensuring that Special Procedures and Commissions of Inquiry engage more deeply with accountability-related issues, formulating appropriate recommendations and conducting studies where and when needed.

Gabriella Citroni, TRIAL’s Senior Legal Adviser said: “putting higher on the agenda the fight against impunity requires cooperation between all stakeholders, in particular States and civil society organizations. This publication aims at making accountability a key objective for the Geneva-based human rights bodies”.
“Although the UN human rights system has made great strides over the years in the promotion and protection of human rights, one area in which it has fallen short of its potential is in the area of combating impunity,” said Ian Seiderman, ICJ’s Legal & Policy Director.”As long as perpetrators of gross human rights violations avoid facing justice, human rights can never be fully realized”.
