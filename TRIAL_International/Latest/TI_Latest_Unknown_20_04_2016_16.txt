facts

Jacques Mungwarere was born in 1972 in Rwanda. He was a professor at España School in the former prefecture of Kibuye in Rwanda.
Arriving in Canada in 1998, he obtained refugee’s status in 2002 and worked as temporary warehouseman in a factory of Windsor, South of the Ontario in Canada, where he lived with his wife and his three children.
Jacques Mungwarere is accused of having participated in the killing of Tutsi at Mugonero Hospital, Murambi Adventist Church, Gitwe Catholic Church and in Bisesero.
He would have been the first person to make public the theory of killing Tutsis and throwing them into Nyabaronga River, a tributary of River Nile, in order to make it easier for them to flow to Ethiopia where he said they originated.
The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), in Windsor, arrested Jacques Mungwarere on 6 November 2009, in cooperation with Rwanda’s Genocide Fugitive Tracking Unit (GFTU).
