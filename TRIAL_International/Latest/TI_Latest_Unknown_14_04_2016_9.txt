facts 

Lukasz Bywalec is a member of the Polish Army and son of the retired colonel Wladyslaw Bywalec. He completed a military academy in Poland and was assigned to the 18th Airborne-Assault Battalion in Bielsko-Biala.
Bywalec was the commander of one Polish unit in Poland’s contingent in NATO’s International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan, authorized by the United Nations Security Council resolution 1386 (adopted on 20 December 2001).
On 16 August 2007, two Polish military vehicules from a Polish-US convoy were damaged in an improvised explosive device ambush and shot at by the Taliban forces, injuring two soldiers, near the village of Nangar Khel, situated in the mountainous southeastern Paktika province of Afghanistan. Several hours later, a platform trailer was sent to tow away the vehicules, accompanied by Bywalec’s commando unit and another unit. Bywalec’s unit is claimed to have had an order of Olgierd ‘Olo’ Cieśla, the commander of the Wazi-Kwa base, to attack three villages. Bywalec showed the targets to the second unit on an electronic map. The units then opened fire on the village with up to 24 mortar rounds and automatic weapons. Three rounds ended in a compound in which a wedding celebration was taking place and subsequently detonated in it. At least six Afghan civilians, including a pregnant woman and three children were killed during the incident, and several others were wounded.
On 13 November 2007, Bywalec and six other Polish soldiers were arrested on allegations of war crimes and detained in the military prison of Poznan (Poland).
