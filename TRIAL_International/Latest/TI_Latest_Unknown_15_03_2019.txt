Stand alongside victims of corporate abuse!
15.03.2019
How can a war-torn country defend its natural resources from large corporations exploiting the conflict to make a profit? What are the options for communities who are losing their livelihoods because of illegal deals between companies and governments? Sadly, these are the questions facing many victims in resource intensive countries. The greed of corporations deprives them of their land and further fuels the ongoing conflicts in the region.
In other cases, companies are complicit in supplying goods, technology or funding to oppressive regimes, who are committing atrocities against their own people. Placing profits above human lives, these corporations are guilty of the worst human rights violations, but have the resources to shut down legal challenges and continue acting with impunity.
As Corporate Accountability Expert in TRIALâ€™s International Investigations and Litigation department, my time is mainly dedicated to gathering evidence against alleged perpetrators of international crimes.
