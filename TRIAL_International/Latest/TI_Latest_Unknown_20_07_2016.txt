Tomasz Borysiewicz was a sergeant and Platoon commander from the 18th Airborne-Assault battalion, which was part of the Polish Military Contingent taking part in the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan between 2002 and 2014.
On 16 August 2007, Borysiewicz and his patrol were allegedly responsible for an attack on the village of Nangar Khel, in eastern Afghanistan. They reportedly fired 26 rounds of mortar shells into the village, one of which exploded inside a compound where a wedding party was taking place. The attack resulted in the killing of eight civilians, including children and women. Six were killed immediately while two more died from their injuries at the hospital. Two soldiers, who later served as witnesses for the prosecution, refused to follow the order and requested the base to stop the attack on the wedding party. The Polish attack on Nangar Khel took place nonetheless.
The soldiers had allegedly been sent to the village of Nangar Khel as a retaliation for the injuries suffered few hours earlier by another group of Polish soldiers after their vehicule hit a Taliban mine outside the village.
On 13 November 2007, Borysiewicz and six other soldiers were arrested and brought to a detention centre. The other soldiers were Captain C. Olgierda, Lieutenant Colonel Luke Bywalec, Warrant officer Andrzej Osiecki and Privates Jacka Janika, Roberta Boksy and Damian Ligocki. The senior officers were released in May and the others in June 2008.
