facts

Roman Krol is an American citizen who was born in Russia. In 2003 and 2004, he was responsible for the interrogation of detainees in Abu Ghraib prison.
In late 2003, rumours started circulating that members of the US army had been mistreating and torturing Iraqi detainees in Abu Ghraib prison. In January 2004, Joseph Darby, a member of the US military police, informed the army leadership about these abuses and supplied the officer in charge with photographic material. The pictures documented scenes in which naked Iraqi detainees were being beaten and forced to simulate sexual acts.
At the end of January 2004, the commander-in-chief of the multinational troops in Iraq, General Ricardo Sanchez, instructed General Antonio Taguba to set up an inquiry into the affair. The findings of his investigation were handed over to the authorities in charge on 4 April 2004.
The Taguba report (see ‘links’) concluded that American soldiers carried out acts of humiliation which severely violated international law. It stated that numerous ‘sadistic abuses’ were inflicted upon detainees of Abu Ghraib between October and December 2003. The guards had set up their own rules, which were condoned more or less explicitly by their superiors.
The report cited numerous examples of maltreatment towards detainees, such as physical and sexual abuse, torture, intimidation by using military dogs and the threat of rape and killing.
Roman Krol admitted to throwing water over naked prisoners, forcing prisoners to crawl naked around the floor and throwing a football directly in their faces.
Roman Krol was indicted by the US army.
