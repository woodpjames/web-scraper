Ahmed Mustafa Kamel, an Egyptian national, was a State Security Officer in the now defunct Egyptian State Security Investigations Service (SSI), Ministry of Interior. He was one of five SSI officers involved in the torture and murder of Sayed Bilal.  Bilal, a Salafist, was accused of involvement in a church bombing.
Immediately following a New Year’s Eve mass on 31 December 2010, just weeks after the Arab Spring began in Tunisia and before the Egyptian Revolution of 2011 began, a bomb went off outside a Coptic Christian church in Alexandria killing 23 worshippers and wounding nearly 100 more.
Among those arrested for questioning about the bombing was 31-year old Sayed Bilal, taken from his home at dawn on 5 January 2011.  Bilal’s body was returned to his family a day later, signs of torture evident.  Bilal was reportedly beaten in the streets in full view of witnesses.  Police refused to take responsibility for his death, saying instead that he had died of asphyxia.  The forensic report indicated numerous injuries, but that Bilal died specifically of a brain bleed resulting from a head injury.
Following Bilal’s death, his family complained that they were harassed and intimidated by SSI officers when attempting to determine the circumstances surrounding his death.  Bilal’s family eventually filed a lawsuit against the SSI accusing their officers of being responsible for Bilal’s death.
Kamel, along with four other SSI officers (Hossam al-Shenawy, Osama al-Konayesi, Mohamed Abdel Aleem and Mohammed al-Shimi) was ordered by a judge at a court in Alexandria on 26 October 2011 to stand trial for the torture and murder of Bilal.
