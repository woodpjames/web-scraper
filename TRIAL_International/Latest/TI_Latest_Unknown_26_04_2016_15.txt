facts

Khalid Sheik Mohammed grew up in Kuwait. He was born to a religious family and when he turned 16 he joined the Muslim Brotherhood. After graduating as a mechanical engineer in 1986 in the United States (North Carolina), he moved to Afghanistan in order to fight against the Soviet invasion. Mohammed is the uncle of Ramzi Yousef, the man suspected to be the mind behind the terroristic attack on the World Trade Center in 1993.
In 1994, Mohammed left for the Philippines with Yousef allegedly for the preparation of “Operation Bojinka”. The operation aimed to blow up 12 American aircrafts above the Pacific Ocean. They also allegedly planned the assassination of President Clinton during his official trip to Manila in 1994. Operation Bojinka was however revealed and dismantled in 1995. Wanted by U.S. authorities, Mohammed fled back to Afghanistan in 1996.
The U.S. authorities consider Mohammed the mastermind behind the terroristic attack of 9/11, for which 19 Al-Qaeda members hijacked four passenger jets. Two of the jets were crashed into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City, the third into the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia and the forth in a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, after a group of passengers and crew members tried to regain control over the aircraft. The aim of the attackers was to reach Washington D.C. in order to destroy the Capitol and the White House.
More than 3000 civilians lost their lives in the attacks.
In October 2001, Mohammed became one of the 22 most wanted people by the FBI.
