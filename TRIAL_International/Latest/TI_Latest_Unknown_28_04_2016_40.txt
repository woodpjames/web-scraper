facts

Branko Topola was born on 21 June 1968 in Prijedor. During the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, he was a guard at the Trnopolje detention camp.
In August 1992, while an armed conflict was taking place between Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (later Serbia and Montenegro) and Croatia on the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina, a widespread and systematic attack was launched by the Bosnian Serb military, paramilitary and police forces against the non-Serb civilian population of the municipality of Prijedor.
Branko Topola is accused of having taken part in an event that took place on 21 August 1992. It is alleged that on that day, a group of non-Serb prisoners, detained in the Trnopolje concentration camp, were informed that they would be “exchanged” against Serbian prisoners and transported to Travnik. That same morning, several hundreds – perhaps more than a thousand – civilian men, women and children gathered in the village of Tukovi. They had been told that a convoy would be organized that day to Travnik. It is alleged that the convoy transporting the non-Serb men stopped along the way at a location called Koricanske Stijene, where the detainees were ordered to leave the buses with their heads down and to kneel at the edge of a cliff. The police then allegedly started firing at the men. Apart from twelve persons who survived the massacre, it is estimated that more than 200 men were killed.
On 27 August 2009, Branko Topola was arrested by the State Investigation and Protection Agency (SIPA). At the time of this arrest, he was an active officer at the Prijedor police station.
