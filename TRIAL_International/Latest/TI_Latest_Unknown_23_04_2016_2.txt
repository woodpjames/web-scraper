During the Genocide, Bugingo was allegedly a high profile militia member in Kibungo Prefecture, now Ngoma District, and a renowned businessman in Kibungo town.
He allegedly was a member of the Interahamwe militia which was responsible for most of the killings in the 1994 genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda during which an estimated number of 800.000 people were killed. Bugingo allegedly supervised killings, planned the attacks and distributed food rations to the Interahamwe militia.
A Member of Parliament who survived the Kibungo executions told the Rwandan newspaper “New Times” that the Interahamwe militia had formed lines, had moved into bushes and gullies to hunt and kill the hiding Tutsi. When the Interahamwe gangs had returned from their daily killing tours, a report of the killings had been submitted to three people: Etienne Nzabonimana, Habimana alias Cyasa and to Bugingo. The survivor said further that Bugingo as well as the other two had been clearly among the leaders of the Interahamwe who were given names and figures or those killed, arranged for the day’s food and the next day’s attacks. The survivor also said that while the other two went into the bush to hunt and kill hiding Tutsis, Bugingo drove around in a Suzuki vehicle monitoring the streets of Kibungo town.
In 2001 Bugingo moved to Bergen (Norway) with his wife and three children. According to “New Times” he worked as a cleaner in a mall.
Rwanda sent out an indictment and an international arrest warrant to Norway for Bugingo in January 2008.
On 3 May 2011, Bugingo was arrested in Norway by the National Criminal Investigation Service. According to John Bosco Siboyintore, acting head of the Genocide Fugitives Tracking Unit (GFTU), Norwegian investigators and prosecutors had gone to Rwanda to gather information and had been investigating him for the last two years,
