facts

Jean Léonard Teganya was born on 12 November 1971 and is of Rwandan nationality.
An ethnic Hutu, he was a medical intern at Butare University Hospital when Hutu extremists killed nearly 200 Tutsi patients, medical staff and moderate Hutus there during the 1994 Rwandan genocide. Some medics and nurses were complicit in the slaughter. A Canadian court reviewing Teganya’s asylum application upheld the Refugee Protection Division finding of complicity in the crimes committed by the military during the time of the massacre at Butare University Hospital because Teganya was aware of the abuses committed in the hospital.
After the 1994 Rwandan Genocide, Teganya is reported to have spent time in DR Congo, Kenya and India before heading to Canada in 1999, where he sought asylum in 2011.
Teganya is wanted for deportation to Rwanda for allegedly violating human rights under the Crimes Against Humanity and War Crimes Acts according to an active Canadian warrant. He was arrested on 3 August 2014 by US Border Patrol in Houlton, Maine.
