On 13 July 1995, Ivanovic participated in the Srebrenica massacre. Ivanovic accompanied the residents of Srebrenica from Sandici to a warehouse owned by an agricultural organisation in the village of Kravica. After having been captured on 11 July, one thousand residents from Srebrenica were killed in the warehouse in Kravica. Ivanovic was behind the warehouse preventing the escape of any of the victims who were being killed inside. A witness saw Ivanovic behind the warehouse where Petar Mitrovic, another police officer, said he was with Ivanovic and two other police officers at the time of the massacre.
Ivanovic also helped to protect Konjevic Polje-Bratunac street in the village of Sandici so that it could be used for the transportation of the Bosnians who had been forcefully taken from Srebrenica. He participated in the detention of Bosnian men who were found in the woods near Srebrenica, and helped to accompany the detainees on their journey to Kravica where they were killed.
In 2009, Ivanovic was accused of having participated in the massacre near Srebrenica.
