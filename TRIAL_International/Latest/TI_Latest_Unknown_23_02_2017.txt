Judicial reparations for the Mutarule massacre
23.02.2017
After many months of silence, the verdict for the crimes committed in Mutarule has finally been made public. The massacre committed in 2014 against the village has been described as a crime against humanity and the victims will receive financial compensation.
Close to a hundred victims took part in the trial, including ninety-three who were represented by lawyers trained by TRIAL International. After tense hearings in August 2016, the South Kivu Military Court gave its verdict last week, acknowledging that crimes against humanity had been committed in Mutarule.
In spite of that, none of the three defendants have been convicted for crimes against humanity. One was acquitted. Another, Mr Sheria, the alleged leader of an armed group, was sentenced to 15 years in prison for illegal possession of war weapons â€“ but not for his direct involvement in the massacre of 6 June, which according to the Court has not been proven. The third defendant was Major Kayumba, a representative of the Congolese army, who was sentenced to 10 years in prison for violation of orders.
