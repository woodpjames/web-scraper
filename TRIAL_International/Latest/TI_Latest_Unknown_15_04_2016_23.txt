facts

Luis García Meza Tejada was born on 8 August 1932 in La Paz, Bolivia. After studying at the Military School from 1948 to 1952, García worked there as a Cavalry instructor from 1956 to 1957 and a Company Commander from 1963 to 1964. In November 1964 García helped to capture the Palace of Government. From 1970 to 1979, he rose in the ranks of the military, working in positions such as Commander of the Cavalry Regiment, Chief of Staff of the 7th Division of Cochabamba, Commander of the 6th Division of Trinidad, Commander of the Military School and, finally, Army Commander in November 1979.
In November 1979, following a “mini” coup d’état, García forced interim President Lidia Guilier to dismiss Army Commander General Rocha so that García could replace him. After some months, on 18 July 1980, a committee of army commanders, led by García, succeeded in launching a violent coup d’état, the so-called “cocaine coup”. Rumours that the Argentine army’s 601 Intelligence Battalion participated in this coup d’état do exist and it has also been suggested that members of certain drug trafficking cartels, including from Roberto Suarez’s, were involved. Their participation in the coup d’état served to buy their protection from García’s new government. The coup also received support from various former Nazis, including Klaus Barbie.
García brought a dictatorship to Bolivia, banning all political parties, sending opposition leaders into exile, suppressing trade unions and removing freedom of the press. Although García’s dictatorship only lasted a year, it is infamous for having been very violent. In thirteen months, Bolivia’s army killed over 1000 people, including human rights lawyer Marcelo Quiroga, who had brought charges against former dictator Hugo Banzer. During this period there were also enforced disappearances and 4000 people were detained illegally.
On 15 January 1981, at the Calle Harrington massacre in La Paz, eight leaders of the Movement of the Revolutionary Left (MIR in Spanish) were assassinated. The only person able to escape was Gloria Ardaya, who was later detained, tortured and sent into exile. García’s government was also infamous for its links to drug trafficking, which separated it from other regimes. These links led the government to stand down on the 3 August 1981, following international pressure and army infighting.
Criminal proceedings began in February 1986 with Congress bringing charges against García and 53 collaborators at Bolivia’s Supreme Court of Justice.
