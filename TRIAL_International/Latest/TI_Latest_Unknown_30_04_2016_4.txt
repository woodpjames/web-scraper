At the time of the events, Amos Yaron was a Brigadier General in the Israeli army and a Division Commander.
On 6 June 1982, the Israeli army invaded Lebanon as part of an operation called “Peace in Galilee”. The Israeli forces made rapid progress and soon reached Beirut.
On 11 September 1982, Ariel Sharon who, at the time was Minister of Defence, declared that “2000 terrorists” remained inside Palestinian camps close to Beirut. On 15 September, on the day following the assassination of Bashir Gemayel – the then recently elected Lebanese President, who was also the leader of the Phalangist militias allied with Israel -, the Israeli army occupied west Beirut. The Sabra and Shatila camps, occupied by Lebanese and Palestinian civilians, were surrounded and cut off from the outside world by the Israeli forces.
On 16 September, a unit of around 150 Lebanese Phalangists entered the camps. Up until 18 September, numerous civilians, including women and children, were badly abused, injured, raped and killed. According to some sources, 800 to 1500 people, possibly even more, were murdered by the Phalangists.
As a result of these events, Israel set up an official Commission of Inquiry headed by Yitzhak Kahan, a Supreme Court judge. On 7 February 1983, the Commission concluded on the culpability of the Lebanese Christian militias. Amos Yaron, for his part, was suspected of having allowed the Phalangists to get on with their criminal acts without intervening to put a stop to them. The report of the Kahan Commission stated that Amos Yaron was aware of the massacres and was reported to have urged the Phalangists not to kill the women and children. But beyond this, Amos Yaron was said to have done nothing to put a stop to the killings. To the Kahan Commission, the Brigadier General Yaron was in serious breach of the duties incumbent on his position.
