Theophister Mukakibibi is a Rwandan nun. During the Rwandan genocide of 1994, while in charge of food stocks at the National University Hospital in Butare, she was reported to have denied food to Tutsis seeking refuge in the hospital. She also was said to have contributed to the expulsion of Tutsis hidden in the hospital.
According to witnesses, she took identity papers from persons arriving to the Hospital in Butare and later indicated to the militiamen which ones were Tutsis. Moreover, according to Baptiste Ndahumba, President of the local Gacaca court, pregnant women, children and infants were not spared by Theophister Mukakibibi even to the extent that she reportedly dumped a baby in a latrine.
Finally, she was accused of holding meetings with militiamen and of taking an army officer as her escort during the killings.
