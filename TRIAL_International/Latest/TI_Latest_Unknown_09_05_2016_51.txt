Hugo Ildebrando Pascarelli was born on 9 October 1928 in Buenos Aires. He followed a standard military career. In 1976, the year of the coup d’état, he held the rank of colonel in the Argentinian army. He was in charge of Zone 114 where the “El Vesubio” clandestine detention centre was located, 30km from Buenos Aires. This detention centre was answerable to the First Corps of the army under the control of General Suarez Mason. The detention centre was closed as quickly as possible in September 1978 when the military thought that a delegation from the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) were about to arrive to investigate complaints of human rights violations at the centre.
It is estimated that more than 1500 people passed through “El Vesubio”; over half disappeared.

In 2010, Pascarelli and his superior, General Héctor Humberto Gamen, were accused of 156 crimes against humanity, including; kidnappings and torture, 22 murders disguised as confrontations in 1977, and 75 forced disappearances including 16 pregnant women. Pascarelli was in charge of Zone 114 and commanded the first artillery regiment of La Tablada which relied on the commando tactical operations based in Palermo, a suburb of Buenos Aires.
