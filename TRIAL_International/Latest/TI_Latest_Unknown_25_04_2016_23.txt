facts

Ramzi bin al-Shibh was born on 1 May 1972 in the Yemeni province of Hadhramaut. In 1995, he applied for a visa to the US, but his application was turned down twice.
He travelled to Germany and applied for political asylum there, using a false name and claiming that he was Sudanese. The asylum request was denied by Germany in January 1996 and Bin al-Shibh returned to Yemen.
He once again applied for a visa for Germany, this time using his real name and nationality, and was accepted. Upon his return to Germany in 1997 he enrolled at a university in Hamburg and met future 9/11 passenger plane hijackers Mohammed Atta, Marwan al-Shebhi and Ziad Jarrah.
Along with the other three, Bin al-Shibh travelled to Pakistan in 1999 to receive training in Al-Qaeda camps. The group is said to have met with high ranking Al-Qaeda figures on this trip (allegedly Osama bin Laden and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed).
Bin al-Shibh is said to have been among the designated 9/11 airplane hijackers but had to be replaced because despite various attempts, he was unable to secure a visa to enter the USA. According to US officials, instead he allegedly acted as a facilitator to the plot, serving as link between the operatives in the US and Al-Qaedaâ€™s leaders in Afghanistan and Pakistan, handling logistics and money matters. Bin al-Shibh is said to have conducted wire transfers from Germany and Yemen to the hijackers in the US and one wire transfer to the flight school where they trained. US intelligence officials allege that Bin al-Shibh may also have been involved in two other operations ascribed to Al-Qaeda, namely the bombing of the USS Cole in Yemen in 2000 and the attack on the El Ghriba synagogue in Tunisia in 2002.
