facts

Rúben Norberto Paccagnini was born on 22 February 1927.
On 15 August 1972, during the dictatorship of General Alejandro Agustin Lanusse in Argentina, 25 political prisoners from extreme left wing organisations who had taken up arms against the military regime, managed to escape from Rawson prison in the Chubut province of Patagonia in Argentina. Six of them were successful in boarding a plane and fleeing to Chile; the remaining 19 being surrounded and held at the airport. Marine captain Luis Emilio Sosa is said to have agreed to take them back safe and sound, to Rawson prison with guarantees for their physical security, on condition that they gave up their arms.
The prisoners surrendered, but contrary to the promise given by Sosa, they were taken to the Amiral Naval base in Trelew. On 22 August 1972, at 3am, captains Luis Emilio Sosa, Rúben Norberto Paccagnini and Raúl Alberto Herrera, together with lieutenants Emilio Jorge del Real and Carlos Roberto Guillermo Bravo, are alleged to have ordered corporal Carlos Marandino to open the doors of the prison cells, to awaken the prisoners, to order them out of their cells and to line them up in double file in the corridor. The five marine officers then fired on them at point blank range. Three prisoners survived the shooting. Thirteen of them died as a result, several of them from a final bullet in the back of the neck. According to the version of the events from the marines, one of the prisoners had tried to get hold of a weapon and to escape.
After these events, Paccagnini’s whereabouts were kept secret by the Marines for 20 years.
In February 2006, the family of one of the victims filed a complaint against the marines with the Federal Tribunal in Rawson and was soon to be followed by other families of victims.
