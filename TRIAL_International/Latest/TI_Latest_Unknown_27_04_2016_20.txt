Ladislaus Csizsik-Csatary (Laszlo Csatary thereafter) was born on 4 March 1915. During World War II he served as a Royal Hungarian Police Commander and was in charge of the city of Kassa, at that time under Hungarian rule and now known as Kosice, Slovakia. In that function he was allegedly responsible for the Jewish ghetto in Kosice, the first one established in Hungary following the German occupation.
Laszlo Csatary was alleged to have been involved in the deportation of 300 Jews from Kosice to Kamianets-Podilskyi in Ukraine, where almost all of the deportees were killed in the massacre of August 1941. Furthermore Csatary was accused for organizing the transfer of about 15â€™700 Jews from Kosice to the concentration camp Auschwitz in 1944.
He was accused of having inhumanely exercised his authority over the inhabitants of the ghetto in Kosice.
After the war the state of Czechoslovakia convicted him in absentia for war crimes and sentenced him to death in 1948. In 1949 Csatary moved to Canada. He obtained Canadian citizenship in 1955, residing in Montreal and working as an art dealer. His real identity was eventually disclosed in 1995. When questioned, he admitted having been involved in the deportation of Jews, but insisted that he only played a minor role in the process. In 1997, Canadian authorities accused him of lying to immigration officials about his wartime activities and about being a Yugoslav citizen. He was stripped of Canadian citizenship the same year and fled the country before he could be summoned to hearings in connection with his deportation.
His whereabouts remained unknown until 2011 when he was discovered living in Budapest under his own name in 2011.
