Facts

Pedro Richter Prada was born in 1921 in Peru. He is a former Peruvian politician and general. After the 1968 coup that deposed President Belaúnde and established the Revolutionary Government of the Armed Forces, he was first Minister of the Interior between 1971 and 1975 and then Prime Minister, Minister of War and Commander in Chief of the Peruvian Army between 30 January 1979 and 28 July 1980.
In the context of Operation Condor, in June 1980 Richter Prada was allegedly involved in the capture and expulsion of four Argentinians, accused of being high ranking members of the Montoneros, a leftist urban guerrilla group. The four victims, some of them with Italian nationality, were soon after expelled to Argentina through Bolivia. This operation was led with the collaboration of the Peruvian Prime Minister Pedro Richter Prada and the support of the military intelligence service, under the command of German Ruiz Figueroa.
Covered reports discovered in 1992 among the so-called Operation Condor’s “Archives of Terror” documented the infliction of torture, disappearance and killings on political opponents extradited to Argentina under the regime of Jorge Videla.
