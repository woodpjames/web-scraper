facts

Lieutenant Colonel Steven L. Jordan was the director of the Joint Interrogation and Debriefing Centre at Abu Ghraib prison from September 2003 until December 2004.
In late 2003, rumours started circulating that members of the US army had been mistreating and torturing Iraqi detainees in Abu Ghraib prison. In January 2004, Joseph Darby, a member of the US military police, informed the army leadership about these abuses and supplied the officer in charge with photographic material. The pictures documented scenes in which naked Iraqi detainees were being beaten and forced to simulate sexual acts.
At the end of January 2004, the commander-in-chief of the multinational troops in Iraq, General Ricardo Sanchez, instructed General Antonio Taguba to set up an inquiry into the affair. The findings of his investigation were handed over to the authorities in charge on 4 April 2004.
The Taguba report (see ‘links’) concluded that American soldiers carried out acts of humiliation which severely violated international law. It stated that numerous ‘sadistic abuses’ were inflicted upon detainees of Abu Ghraib between October and December 2003. The guards had set up their own rules, which were condoned more or less explicitly by their superiors.
The report mentions numerous examples of maltreatment towards detainees, such as physical and sexual abuse, torture, intimidation by using military dogs and the threat of rape and killing.
The staff of Abu Ghraib prison confirmed that Steven L. Jordan played an important role in the maltreatment of prisoners and said that he was directly responsible for the use of unmuzzled dogs in interrogations in November 2003.
Steven L. Jordan was indicted by the US army on 27 April 2006.
