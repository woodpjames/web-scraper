After war broke out in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1992, Stojanovic fought for the Serbian party in the conflict, on the territory of the municipality of Zvornik.
He was a member of a paramilitary group called “Sima’s Chetniks” which got its name after Sima Bogdanovic, also known as “Sima Cetnik”, who was its commander.
During the conflict, numerous violations of international humanitarian law were alleged to have been perpetrated against Roma population in the villages of Skocic, Setic, Malesic, Klisa, Petkovci and Drinjaca by Sima’s Chetniks.
Stojanovic allegedly took part in the attack of Skocic village where the group destroyed a mosque using explosives, searched houses of the Roma villagers while also expelling them, stole their property, physically assaulted them, ordered the civilians to perform humiliating acts to each other, tortured them, and finally transported them to other villages.
Some of the civilians from the Skocic village were allegedly transferred to village Malesic while others to the village of Setici. Stojanovic, with the help of other group members, was suspected of personally killing the civilians, who were taken one by one and shot or stabbed. Three women were allegedly separated from the group and Stojanovic allegedly threatened to kill those who were unwilling to obey orders upon transfer to Malesic village.
Stojanovic was suspected of repeatedly raping and sexually assaulting these three women who were kept in a house in a period of few months, starting 11 July 1992. He is also alleged to have tortured them psychologically.
Stojanovic was arrested and brought in custody of Serbian authorities pursuant to the ruling of the Court of Appeal of Belgrade on 2 February 2010.
