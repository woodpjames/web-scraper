Lapka Tamang: Tortured by policemen aged 11
10.03.2016
Introduction 
Lakpa Tamang v. Nepal
Mr. Lakpa Tamang was only 11 when he was tortured by police officers in 2010. This ignoble act was partly facilitated by the fact that Nepal sets the age of criminal responsibility at 10 years old â€“ an incredibly young age at odds with international standards and with grave repercussions for the youth. In March 2016, TRIAL submitted a complaint on behalf of Mr. Lakpa Tamang before the United Nations Human Rights Committee, aiming at obtaining justice and redress for the victim and pushing Nepal to change its legislation and its practice of criminalizing minors.
