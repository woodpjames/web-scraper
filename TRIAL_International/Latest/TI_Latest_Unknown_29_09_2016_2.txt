On 15 August 1972, during the dictatorship of General Alejandro Agustin Lanusse in Argentina, 25 political prisoners from extreme left wing organisations who had taken up arms against the military regime, managed to escape from Rawson prison in the Chubut province of Patagonia in Argentina. Six of them were successful in boarding a plane and fleeing to Chile; the remaining 19 were surrounded at the airport and detained. Marine captain Luis Emilio Sosa reportedly agreed to take them back safe and sound, to Rawson prison with guarantees for their physical security, on condition that they gave up their arms.
The prisoners surrendered, but contrary to the promise given by Sosa, they were taken to the Amiral Naval base in Trelew. On 22 August 1972, at 3am, captains Sosa, Rúben Paccagnini and Raúl Herrera, together with lieutenants Emilio del Real and Carlos Bravo, allegedly ordered corporal Carlos Marandino to open the doors of the prison cells, awaken the prisoners, order them out of their cells and line them up in double file in the corridor. The five marine officers then fired on them at point blank range. Three prisoners survived the shooting with serious injuries and have eventually testified against these crimes and 16 of them died, several of them from a final bullet in the back of the neck. According to the version of the events from the marines, one of the prisoners had tried to get hold of a weapon and to escape. These events are publicly known under the name of “massacre of Trelew”.
In February 2006, the family of one of the victims filed a complaint against the marines before the Federal Tribunal in Rawson and was soon to be followed by other families of victims.
