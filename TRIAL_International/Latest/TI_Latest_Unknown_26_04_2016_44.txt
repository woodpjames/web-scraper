facts

Mustafa Amine Badreddine was born on 9 April 1961, in al-Ghobeiry, Beirut, Lebanon. He studied political science at the Lebanese American University from 2002 to 2004.
Badreddine allegedly joined Hezbollah in 1982. He was said to be a member of the Hezbollah Shura Council and reportedly became Hezbollah’s military commander in 2008 after his brother in law, Imad Mughniyeh, died in an explosion in Syria. He was reportedly responsible for Hezbollah’s military operations in Syria since 2011.
In 2005, Badreddine, together with Salim Jamil Ayyash, Hussein Hassan Oneissi and Assad Hassan Sabra allegedly participated in a conspiracy to assassinate Rafik Hariri, the former Prime Minister of Lebanon and Member of Parliament at that time. Hariri was killed on 14 February 2005, in a suicide bomb attack in Beirut, which killed 21 other persons and injured 226 persons.
According to the indictment Baddredine was the overall controller of the operation, i.e. he monitored the physical perpetration of the attack, monitored and coordinated the surveillance of Hariri in preparation for the attack and the purchase of the van used during the attack.
Shortly after the explosion, a man named Ahmad Abu Adass allegedly falsely claimed to be the suicide bomber. Badreddine was accused of having been implicated in the preparation of this false claim of responsibility.
On 28 June 2011 the Pre-Trial Judge of the Special Tribunal for Lebanon (STL) confirmed the indictment submitted by the Prosecutor on 17 January 2011.
On 30 June 2011, the indictment against Badreddine, Ayyash, Oneissy and Sabra was sent to the Lebanese authorities. On 8 July 2011 international arrest warrants were issued against the four accused. Badreddine was however never arrested.
