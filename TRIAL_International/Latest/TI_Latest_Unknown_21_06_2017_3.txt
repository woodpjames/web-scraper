Facts

Aria Ladjedvardi was born in Germany in 1995, in his Iranian family. He became radicalised while living in Germany. He traveled to Syria, where he joined jihadist groups in the Idlib province from March to April 2014.
Between 8 March and 16 April 2014, a jihadist group attacked a checkpoint in the Idlib Province. They captured, beheaded and impaled the heads of two soldiers on spikes before putting them on public display. After Ladjedvardiâ€™s return to Germany, one of his fellow fighters uploaded on Facebook three pictures of him allegedly posing with the severed heads of enemy combatants, together with another man known to be involved with jihadist groups in Syria.
