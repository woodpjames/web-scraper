BiH: TRIAL brings third enforced disappearance case to the UN
12.11.2009
In November 2009, the Advocacy Center – TRIAL (ACT) submitted a communication to the UN Human Rights Committee concerning the enforced disappearance of Mr. Safet Kozica. ACT represents Mirha Kozica, Bajazit Kozica and Selima Kozica, respectively mother, brother and sister of the disappeared.
  Mr. Safet Kozica was last seen on 16 June 1992 in the hands of members of the army of the Republika Srpska (Vojska Republike Srpske – VRS) in the concentration camp known as “Planjina kuca”, located in the municipality of Vogošća, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). His fate and whereabouts remain unknown since then.
Mrs. Mirha Kozica, Mr. Bajazit Kozica and Ms. Selima Kozica live in a lacerating situation of uncertainty, in spite of numerous attempts to establish the truth regarding the circumstances of the enforced disappearance of their loved one, his fate and whereabouts and the progress and results of the investigations.
More than 17 years after the events, no ex officio, prompt, impartial, thorough and independent investigation has been carried out by BiH authorities and no one has been prosecuted, judged and sanctioned for the enforced disappearance of Safet Kozica, thus fostering an ongoing climate of impunity. Mirha Kozica is now 80 years old and she fears to die without having established the truth about what has happened to her son.
