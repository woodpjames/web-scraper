facts

Abdallah Banda Abakaer Nourain (“Banda”) was born in Wai, Dar Kobe, in North Darfur. His date of birth is unknown but it is believed to be around 1963. He is a member of the Zaghawa tribe of Sudan. Currently, he is the Commander-in-Chief of the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) Collective-Leadership, which is one of the components of the United Resistance Front.
On 29 September 2007, an attack against the African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) was carried out by splinter forces of the JEM, together with troops belonging to the Sudanese Liberation Army-Unity (SLA-Unity), which had broken away from the Sudanese Liberation Movement/Army (SLM/A). The AMIS was a peace-keeping mission stationed at the Haskanita Military Group Site (MGS Haskanita) in the locality of Umm Kadada in North Darfur, Sudan.
Allegedly, the approximately 1,000 attackers, who were armed with anti-aircraft guns, artillery guns and rocket-propelled grenade launchers, killed 12 AMIS soldiers and severely wounded eight others. In addition, they allegedly destroyed communication facilities, vehicles, computers and other goods which belonged to the AMIS.
Banda was allegedly in command of the JEM splinter forces during this attack. The Pre-Trial Chamber I of the ICC considers there are sufficient grounds to believe there was a non-international armed conflict in Dafur between the Government of Sudan and several organized armed groups, including the JEM and the SLM/A.
The ICC Pre-Trial Chamber I issued Banda a summons to appear on 27 August 2009 for war crimes allegedly committed during the attack of 29 September 2007 against the AMIS.
