facts

Rodolfo Almiron was born in 1935 in Argentina. His past, prior to 1976, is obscure.
This former police officer was one of the presumed leaders of the Triple A. The Triple A (Argentinean Anticommunist Alliance), an extreme right wing paramilitary group which operated within the democratic system before the advent of the 1976 dictatorship, was responsible for the assassination of numerous political opponents, intellectuals and union leaders. It was no secret that the Triple A was linked to and strongly supported by the military junta led by its Commander in Chief Jorge Rafael Videla who had come to power after the 1976 coup d’état.
Almiron is suspected by the Argentinean judicial authorities of being one of the leaders of the Triple A alliance which is said to have eliminated up to 1500 political opponents in the 1970’s during both the presidency of Juan Peron (1973-1974) and his wife Isabel Martinez de Peron, who succeeded him as head of state from 1974 to 1976, with the majority of these murders being committed under the tenure of Isabel Peron. The people killed included persons linked to the left wing insurrectional movements Montoneros, ERP and their supporters as well as judges, police chiefs and social activists.
The National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons, CONADEP, was able to prove the involvement of Triple A in the execution of 19 people in 1973, 50 in 1974 and 359 in 1975, with its participation in several hundred other murders being suspected. Death threats also forced many others into exile.
In 1975, Almiron fled the country which, at the time, was in a state of chaos. Left wing factions were fighting those on the right, as well as the police and the armed forces. After finding refuge in Spain, he became the personal bodyguard of Manuel Fraga Iribarne, a powerful Spanish politician, before finally going into a comfortable retirement.
Rodolfo Almiron was arrested in Spain on 29 December 2006 as a result of an extradition request issued by an Argentinean federal judge, who qualified the Triple A acts as crimes against humanity and part of a process of systematic repression by the state security apparatus.
