facts

William B. Hunsaker is from Missouri and enlisted in the United States Army in 2001. He served in Korea before going to Iraq on 7 August 2005 with the 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 101st Airborne Division (known as the Screaming Eagles).
In the course of a mission codenamed Operation Iron Triangle, Hunsaker and three other soldiers (Sergeant Raymond Girouard, Private First Class Corey Clagett and Specialist Juston Graber) had as their objective a confirmed al-Qaida training compound. This compound had in the past been visited by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.
The four soldiers were led by Col. Steele, who had previously commanded a company sent into Mogadishu, Somalia.
Col. Steele allegedly gave the men the order to “kill all military age males,” which resulted in the three soldiers killing three men.
Subsequently, Hunsaker is alleged to have threatened Private First Class Bradley L. Mason (“I will kill you if you tell anyone” and “don’t tell anyone because if I go to jail I will kill you”), and to have attempted to influence his testimony in the investigation into the shootings.
Hunsaker was arrested some weeks after the killings of 9 May 2006 (date unclear) and incarcerated in Kuwait.
