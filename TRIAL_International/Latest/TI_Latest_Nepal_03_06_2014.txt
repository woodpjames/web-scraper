Nepal: Flawed Transitional Justice Act Adopted
03.06.2014
Last May, the President of Nepal passed a deeply flawed Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act. Violating human rights law standards, this Act raises great concerns, as it will contribute to further entrench impunity in Nepal.
TRIAL calls for amendments to be made and reminds that current Nepalese transitional justice mechanisms are totally inadequate as they:

force reconciliation between victims and perpetrators
grant amnesty to the perpetrators of crimes under international law

Moreover, the prosecution mechanisms for crimes committed during the war prevent any kind of criminal liability for the perpetrators.
Providing a detailed analysis of the Act’s main flaws, TRIAL calls on UN human rights bodies to demand that the Nepalese government amends the Act to ensure that the transitional justice process guarantees victims’ rights and finally delivers truth, justice and reparations.
