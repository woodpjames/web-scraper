facts

Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada was born on 1 July 1930 in La Paz, Bolivia. He was President of Bolivia from 1993 to 1997 and for a second term from 2002 to 2003.
In February 2003, the announcement by de Lozada of his intention to introduce a direct income tax sparked a series of protests and a strike by the police force. The protests culminated in violent clashes between members of the national police force, civilians and the army in La Paz. These events led to the death of over 30 people, with several more injured.
In October 2003, following an agreement concluded by de Lozada with some US oil companies for the sale and export of natural gas via Chile, mass demonstrations followed, especially in La Paz and El Alto. These events, which came to be known as “the Bolivian Gas War” led to the death of at least 80 people, with more than 400 injured – including women and children – according to figures produced by the Permanent Assembly. The victims were members of the Ayrama indigenous minority.
On 13 October 2003, de Lozada resigned the presidency and fled to the United States.
