He was a member of a Serb paramilitary force in Croatia, and more precisely of a group which was known under the name of “SAO Krajina”. He participated in the armed rebellion against the Croatian forces during the Croatian War of Independence from 1991-1995.
The events for which he was indicted go back to 18 August 1991 when certain members of the Serb paramilitary group “SAO Krajina” attacked the Croatian villages of Maja and Svracica and opened up fire on civilians with hand guns and other firearms.
Furthermore, members of the Serb paramilitary forces broke into the houses of civilian Croatians, beat them up and stole some of their valuable possessions. In addition, the “SAO Krajina” forces also set fire to several cultural and religious buildings as well as to many private houses. Some witnesses affirmed that Spanovic was one of the leaders of the Serb paramilitary forces during these attacks on Maja and Svracica.
At a trial, held in absentia in the Sisak District Tribunal in 1993, Spanovic together with 18 other members of the Serb paramilitary forces in Croatia were found guilty of war crimes and sentenced to 20 years in prison.
