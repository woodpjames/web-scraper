facts

Iouri Budanov was born on 24 November, 1963 in Khartsysk, in the region of Donets, Ukraine. In 1987 he completed his military training at Kharkov’s Superior Tanks School. In January 2000 he was decorated with the order of bravery and promoted to the rank of colonel. Soon after he became commander of the 160 Tanks Regiment in Siberia’s military district.
At the time he was commander of this regiment, his division entered the small village of Tangi-Chu in the Urus-Martan district of the Republic of Chechnya during the night of 26 August 2000. Together with a few soldiers he allegedly broke into one of the houses in the village where a Chechen family was living. Once inside the house they were said to have kidnapped the elder daughter, Kheda Kungayeva, who at the time was 18 years old, and to have taken her to their camp site. A forensic report established that in the hours that followed she was savagely beaten, raped and strangled. The young girl’s body, severely marked by the violence it was subjected to, was subsequently buried in a forest near the camp.
Colonel Iouri Budanov who was held to be responsible for this act, would claim later that he believed this young woman to be a sniper who, a few months earlier had killed some soldiers in his regiment and that he had therefore acted in an fit of revenge and anger.
Colonel Iouri Budanov is the first Russian officer of this rank to have been tried and sentenced for crimes committed against Chechen civilians since the hostilities in the Caucasian Republic flared up again on 1 October 1999.
On the 30 March 2000, Colonel Iouri Budanov was arrested for the murder and rape of the young 18-year-old Chechen woman, Kheda Kungayeva.
