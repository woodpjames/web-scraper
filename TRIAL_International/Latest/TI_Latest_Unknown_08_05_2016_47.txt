facts


Ricardo Miguel Cavallo was born on 29 september 1951.
In 1976, as an navy officer he integrated the ESMA (Navy Mechanics School of the Argentine army) in the activity group 332 which specialised in interrogations, torture and the so called “flights of death”, during which opponents to the regime were thrown either from a helicopter into the Rio de la Plata or from an airplane flying off the coastline. The school’s elegant building, situated on one of Buenos Aires’ most opulent avenues, was the nerve centre for the repression of thousands of students, teachers, lawyers or trade union members between 1976 and 1983.
According to a 1984 report of the Argentine Truth Commission, 8961 individuals disappeared during that period of time. Numerous NGO reports claim that 30000 individuals disappeared and that 9000 persons were tortured.
After being Argentina’s military attaché in Paris for three years, Ricardo Miguel Cavallo settled in Mexico in 1984, where he managed the office for vehicle immatriculations. When the last military junta fell in 1986, Cavallo retired from the army and redirected his career to the world of business. In October 1999 he obtained both a residence and a work permit in Mexico.
