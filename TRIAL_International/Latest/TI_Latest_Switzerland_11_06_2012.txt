ICC: Switzerland must promptly implement pledges made in Kampala
11.06.2012
TRIAL has sent on behalf of the Swiss Coalition for the International Criminal Court (CSCPI) a letter to the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs asking Switzerland to follow up not the pledges made during the Review Conference of the Rome Statute in June 2010 that took place in Kampala, Uganda.
The NGOs members of the CSCPI regret notably that Switzerland is the only European state which has signed but not yet ratified the APIC (Agreement on Privileges and Immunities of the Court). Two years after the Conference, the CSCPI also asks Switzerland to accelerate the ratification process of the amendments to the Statute on the crime of aggression and on the prohibition of certain weapons used in the context of non-international armed conflicts.
The Coalition hopes that the Federal Council will soon announce concrete measures enabling it to meet the commitments made in Kampala.
