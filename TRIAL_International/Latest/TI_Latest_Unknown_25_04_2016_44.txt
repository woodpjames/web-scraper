The corporal Stephen B. Tatum, born in 1981, comes from the city of Edmund, Oklahoma. In 2005, he was sent to Haditha, for his second mission in Iraq, after Fallujah in 2004. He was incorporated into the company Kilo of the 3rd battalion of the 1st Marines regiment, which was placed under the command of the Lieutenant-Colonel Jeffrey Chessani (see “ramifications”). The troops were based in an agricultural region situated on the Euphrates, North-West of Bagdad. In this zone, the American and Iraqi forces fought in vain against foreign and local insurgents during a major part of the conflict. Chessani’s men were the principal American targets for enemy attacks. The company had already lost about twenty soldiers at the time of the facts. 
In the morning of November 19, 2005, a convoy of Marines in mission was located on a road nearby the village of Haditha. Tatum was within one of the four Humvees. An artisanal bomb exploded at the passing of the fourth vehicle. The corporal Miguel Terrazas, 20 years old, died immediately. Two other soldiers were injured. Investigations noted that gunshots were fired after that in the direction of the convoy. The subsequent events remain unclear. Presumably in reaction, the men of the unit allegedly machine-gunned a taxi that was circulating on the road. They allegedly assassinated its five passengers, aged 18 to 25 years. They allegedly entered by infraction in several houses and cold-bloodedly killed those who where inside, allegedly not sparing anyone: women, children and elderly people. Twenty-four civilians were assassinated this way. In one house, the corporal Tatum was accused of having thrown a hand grenade in one room, allegedly without knowing that two women and six children were inside. In another room, Tatum allegedly assisted the sergeant Wuterich (see “ramifications”) and fired in the direction of the bed. Seven persons were killed this way. 
After the tragedy, several villagers went to the nearest military base to claim for justice. The Marines allegedly offered up to 2500 dollars to some families in exchange of their silence, in order to cover the facts.
The next day, the Army gave a first version of the facts. The press release of November 20, 2005 indicated that an artisanal bomb allegedly killed an American soldier and 15 civilians, and that the subsequent shootout allegedly killed eight persons amongst the Iraqi insurgents.
At first, even the Pentagon denied this case. It is only after several months that the American President George W. Bush promessed the prosecution of the culprits.
Despite the accusations of Iraqi witnesses, no investigation was opened until January 2006. It is at this date that a video revealed the truth, it was broadcast by an Iraqi student active in the defense of human rights. The images of corpses at the morgue demonstrated that they were not insurgents : women and children were in pyjamas, an elder man held a Koran in his hands. Moreover, the different testimonies of villagers gathered on this footage perfectly corroborated.
In March 2006, an article of the Time magazine revealed the tragedy to the American public opinion and confirmed that American soldiers had indulged in a genuine massacre. The press clipping specified that the soldiers tried to dissimulate the truth with the support of their hierarchy, of which Chessani was part. This public announcement forced the Army to open two internal investigations, one of them led to a judicial procedure.
The killings of Hadita potentially constitutes the gravest war crime of which the American forces in Iraq were accused. However, the aspect that provoked the most ferocious criticism resided in the alleged efforts of the Army and the American government to silence this affair and present a falsified version of the facts for as long as possible.
In April 2006, the soldiers of the Kilo Company were dismissed from their responsibilities and were repatriated to California. The military authorities stated that the loss of confidence in this men resulted in a number of non specified incidents. 
On October 19, 2007, the lieutenant/general James N. Mattis decided to defer Tatum to a martial Court. The date of the trial had been fixed to April 28, 2009. The audience was scheduled to take place at Camp Pendleton (California), the largest Marines base in the world. A military jury had charged the corporal for involuntary homicide, endangerment of the life of others and aggression with aggravating circumstances, in violation with articles 119, 129 and 135 UCMJ (Uniform Code of Military Justice). The charges of homicide and murder by negligence had been dropped. For these three charges, the American law foresees nineteen years of imprisonment.
