Marko Samardzija was born on 1 December 1936 in the municipality of Kljuc. He was a resident of Prijedor, a town situated in the north-west of Bosnia-Herzegovina in the Serb Republic of Bosnia. He is a ethnic Serb citizen of Bosnia-Herzegovina, married and father of two children. He was a school teacher by profession, but was retired at the time the trial started. He had no previous convictions.
Marko Samardzija was found guilty of ordering, in his capacity as commander of the 3rd company of the Sanica battalion, a systematic attack on 10 July 1992 against Muslim civilians in the region of Kljuc. At least 144 persons are known to have been executed during this massacre.
The blockade and the ethnic cleansing of the region followed an order issued the previous day by Drago Samardzija, the Commander Lieutenant Colonel of the Infantry Brigade.
Under the command of Marko Samardzija, the men in this unit compelled the Bosnian inhabitants of the villages of Brkici and Balagica Brdo to leave their homes and make their way to the Jezerine meadow. Here, the men aged between 18 and 60 were separated from the rest of the group. After being transferred to Biljani, a part of this group was forcibly detained in the classrooms of the primary school or in the Dom Kultur building. Then, with the assistance of the Serbian police the soldiers executed these men in groups of 5 to 10.
Close to the school, men from other villages were held against their will by the armed forces. These Muslim civilians were beaten and taken to another location where most of them were killed.
Samardzija and his men heaped the bodies of the victims onto a truck and subsequently threw them into a communal grave. Three bodies were buried in individual gravesites.
