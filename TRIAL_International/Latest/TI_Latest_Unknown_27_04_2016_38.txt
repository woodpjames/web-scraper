Sylvestre Mudacumura was born in Gutumba sector, Gisenyi prefecture in Rwanda in 1954. He is the highest-ranking military commander of the “Forces Démocratiques pour la Libération du Rwanda” (FDLR).
The FDLR is a paramilitary rebel group consisting of former members of Hutu Power rebel group, which participated in the 1994 Rwandan genocide, the mass murder of an estimated number of 800.000 people. Mudacumura himself was the former deputy commander of the Forces Armées Rwandaises (FAR) Presidential Guard in Rwanda in 1994.
The FDLR took part in the Congo wars from 1996 until 2003, which caused about 4 million victims. Even after the end of the Congo wars, FDLR units still attacked Tutsi forces in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo and in the border-zone areas of Rwanda. 25,000 civilians had to flee their homes in 2004 because of the ongoing attacks. On 9 and 10 May 2010, FDLR rebels attacked the population of Ekingi and Busurungi. 90 people were killed in Busurungi. More than 100 people died in Ekingi. From 30 July to 3 August 2010, members of the FDLR raped and offended 154 civilians in Luvungi.
Mudacumura allegedly agreed to conduct these attacks against the civilian population of the Kivus, which took place in the period from 20 January 2009 to 31 August 2010.
On 14 May 2012 the Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) of the International Criminal Court (ICC) requested an arrest warrant for Mudacumura.
