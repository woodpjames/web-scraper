After the death of a member of his Paramilitary Unit “Plavi orlovi”, on 19 May 1992, Živković allegedly participated in the shooting of 11 detained civilians in “Lovački dom”.
On 16 December 2009, under a warrant which had been issued by the prosecutor of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the State Investigation and Protection Agency arrested Milorad Živković together with Milun Kornjača and Dusko Tadić in Čajniče.
