Veselin Vlahovic, born in 1969 in Montenegro, was a member of the paramilitary forces of the Serb Republic of BiH, later Republika Srpska. In his younger year, Vlahovic was a youth boxer and a bouncer in a famous club of Sarajevo.
Vlahović allegedly persecuted the civilian non-Serb population from Grbavica, Vraca and Kovačići settlements in the Novo Sarajevo Municipality. As a part of the persecution on national, ethnic and religious grounds, the accused allegedly committed the crimes of deprivation of life (murder), slavery, rape (including on pregnant women), unlawful detention, physical and mental abuse (inhumane treatment), robbery and enforced disappearance of civilian non-Serb population.
After the war, Vlahović was sentenced to three years for robbery and violence but escaped in 2001. He then shot a man to death in a bar in Serbia, for which he was sentenced in abstentia to 15 years of prison.
Vlahović moved to Spain with a Bulgarian passport, where was wanted for three armed robberies in the Alicante province.
On 2 March 2010, Vlahović was arrested in Spain and later extradited on 29 August 2010 to Bosnia.
