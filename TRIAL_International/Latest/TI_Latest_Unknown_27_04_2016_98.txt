facts

Petar Civcic was born on 12 February 1970 in Gornje Ravno (municipality of Kupres). During the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, he acted as Commander of the Serbian special police unit “Intervention Squad” in Prijedor.
In August 1992, while an armed conflict was taking place between Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (later Serbia and Montenegro) and Croatia on the territory of in Bosnia and Herzegovina, a widespread and systematic attack was launched by the Bosnian Serb military, paramilitary and police forces against the non-Serb civilian population of the municipality of Prijedor.
It is alleged that on 21 August 1992, a group of non-Serb prisoners, detained in the Trnopolje concentration camp, were informed by Serbian paramilitary and police officers that they would be “exchanged” against Serbian prisoners and transported to Travnik. That same morning, several hundreds, perhaps more than a thousand civilian men, women and children gathered in the village of Tukovi. They had been told that a convoy would be organized that day to Travnik. It is alleged that the convoy transporting the non-Serb men stopped along the way at a location called Koricanske Stijene, and the detainees were ordered to leave the buses with their heads down, and to kneel at the edge of a cliff. The police then allegedly started firing at the men. Apart from twelve persons who survived the massacre, it is estimated that more than 200 men were killed. Petar Civcic, as a superior officer of a special police unit involved in this event, is accused of having failed to undertake the necessary and reasonable measures to prevent the perpetration of these crimes and to punish the perpetrators.
On 27 August 2009, Petar Civcic was arrested by the Bosnian State Protection and Investigation Agency (SIPA).
