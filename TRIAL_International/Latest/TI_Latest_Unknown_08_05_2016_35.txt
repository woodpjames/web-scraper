The Razakar was the pro-Pakistan paramilitary force, trained and commanded by the Pakistan army. The Razakar is divided into different brigades with the aim of helping the Pakistan army to fight against Bangladeshi nationalists and the independence of the country.

The group is accused of having committed war crimes and inhumane crimes against Bangladeshi nationalists during this time.
In this context, Master is accused of: having aided and participated in the perpetuation of a genocide; having committed murder, rape and torture and forced conversion of the population, as well as having pillaged and burnt down various villages. Hundreds of people died as the result of these events.
Master was arrested on 21 July 2014 in the region of Bagerhat in Bangladesh after the International Crimes Tribunal in Bangladesh issued a warrant for his arrest.
