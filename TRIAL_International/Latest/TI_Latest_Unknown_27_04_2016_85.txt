facts

Peter Egner, of German origin, was born 1922 in Serbia (former territory of the Kingdom of Serbia, Croatia and Slovenia). He emigrated to the United States in 1960 and received American citizenship in 1966. Peter Egner and his wife Gerda lived near Portland, Oregon (USA). Mr. Egner was employed in a hotel restaurant and also worked as a salesman for a real estate agency. After the death of his wife in 2005, Peter Egner moved to Bellevue (Washington) where some of his relatives lived. During the Second World War, Peter Egner was a member of the Gestapo Division IV and SS non-commissioned officer.
The Kingdom of Yugoslavia was occupied by the troops of the Axis powers (Nazi Germany, fascist Italy and imperial Japan) on 6 April 1941. King Peter II, signed the surrender on 17 April 1941. The Nazi concentration camp Sajmiste (Serbian name Концентрациони логор Сајмиште), which was at the time on the territory of the Independent State of Croatia in a suburb of Belgrade, was set up in October 1941 and closed in September 1944. It was created by order of General Franz Boehme. The majority of Jews in Serbia lost their lives.
The former military firing range of Jajinci, near Belgrade, was used by the Nazis in 1941-1944 to execute over 80,000 people. Most victims came from the camp Banjica. The Banjica concentration camp on the outskirts of Belgrade was initially used for the purpose of detaining hostages. The Nazis imprisoned Jews, Serbs, Roma and opponents of the Third Reich there. The camp, led by a Gestapo officer Willy Friedrich, held up to 23’637 prisoners. The camp was operational between June 1941 and September 1944.
Peter Egner is accused of having helped to set up several concentration camps (including the Sajmiste camp). Thus he could also be said to be involved in the execution of 17 000.
In August 2008 the Serbian prosecutor announced that he had initiated investigation against Peter Egner. Following the announcement, the U.S. Supreme Court (Federal Court) has been asked by the U.S. Department of Justice to initiate the denaturalisation of Peter Egner on the grounds that he had neglected to inform the U.S. authorities during his naturalization ceremony about his Nazi past (INA § 340 (a), 8 USC § 1451 (a) Kungys v. United States, 485 U.S. 759, 767 (1988)) . The process of denaturalisation is supposed to begin next year in Seattle, USA.
