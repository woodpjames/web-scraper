Burundi: civil society raises the alarm
18.05.2017
Four representatives of Burundian NGOs visited Geneva. Pierre-Claver MBONIMPA (President of the APRODH), Armel NIYONGERE (President of ACAT-Burundi and Director of SOS-Torture Burundi), Janvier BIGIRIMANA (Secretary general of FOCODE) and Gordien NIYUNGEKO (Executive Secretary of FOCODE) spoke to TRIAL International about the grim situation in their country.   
It is a pleasure to be here in Geneva and to personally meet our partners, including TRIAL International. We are here to inform the Working Group on Enforced and Involuntary Disappearances of the alarming situation in Burundi, namely the cases documented by our organizations. But meeting up with international actors is equally important in the pursuit of our cause. We need partners and institutional stakeholders to relay our fight.
We are extremely satisfied that the United Nations has set up a Commission of Inquiry. Its very existence is proof of an underlying problem that the Burundian authorities stubbornly deny.
Our government’s refusal to cooperate with the international community is both an admission of weakness and a testament to their lack of arguments. It also proves that the leadership fears the consequences of their actions.
