The Decision 
In October 2013, the Human Rights Committee communicated its decision (in French only), called “views” by the UN.
The Committee held that Algeria violated Articles 6 §1, 7, 9, 10 §1 and 16 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, taken alone and in conjunction with Article 2 § 3 of the Covenant, as well as Article 17 taken in conjunction with Article 2 §3 of the Covenant, with regards to Mr. Nour-Eddine Mihoubi. The Committee also held that Algeria violated Articles 7 and 17 of the ICCPR, taken alone and in conjunction with Article 2 § 3, with regards to the victim’s family.
The Committee requested Algeria to conduct a deep and rigorous investigation into the disappearance of Mr. Farid Faraoun, to provide his family with detailed information concerning the results of its investigation, to free him immediately if he is still being secretly detained or, if he is deceased, to return his mortal remains to his family. Moreover, the Committee insisted on Algeria’s obligation to indict, try and sanction those responsible for the violations committed.
Algeria was also required to pay an adequate compensation to the family of the victim for the violations endured and, if still alive, to the victim itself.Algeria is also required to ensure the effectiveness of its judicial system, in particular regarding the victims of torture, extrajudicial executions and enforced disappearances, and take action in order to avoid the repetition of such violations.
