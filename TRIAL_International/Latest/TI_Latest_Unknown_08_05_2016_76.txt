Paul Mwilambwe was born in Kadjima, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in September 1973. He became a major in the Congolese National Police (CNP) force in 2010. In particular, Mwilambwe was in charge of security for the office of General John Numbi, previous Head of the CNP.
On 1 June 2010, Floribert Chebeya, executive director of the NGO “Voix des sans voix”, (Voice of the voiceless – VSV), a human rights advocacy group, and his colleague and driver, Fidèle Bazana, also a member of the NGO VSV, met Numbi at the headquarters of the PNC. The following day, Chebeya was found dead in his car, and Bazana was never seen again.
Allegedly, Numbi, along with Mwilambwe and seven other police officers tortured and murdered Chebeya and Bazana in the police station on the 1 June 2010.
Shortly after these events, Mwilambwe moved to Belgium, where he lived hidden for several months.
