General Allegation to the Special Rapporteur on Truth, Justice, and Reparations
01.02.2014
In February 2014, TRIAL and other 3 associations submitted a report (called ‘general allegation’ in the UN jargon) to the Special Rapporteur on Truth, Justice, Reparations and Guarantees of Non-Recurrence in order to prompt him to contact the Bosnian government on justice and accountability issues after the release and retrial of more than a dozen convicted war criminals between late 2013 and early 2014.
