Switzerland must not become a refuge for war criminals and torturers
15.03.2012
By refusing to give prosecuting authorities the necessary means, Switzerland takes the risk of becoming a safe haven for war criminals and torturers. The Swiss Coalition for the International Criminal Court has submitted a petition to the Swiss Government today, asking for the creation of a war crimes unit tasked with investigating and prosecuting authors of genocides, war crimes and torture present in Switzerland. The petition has been signed by over 10,000 people.
