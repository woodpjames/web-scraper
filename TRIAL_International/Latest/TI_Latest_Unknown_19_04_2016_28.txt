facts

Dusan Jankovic was born on 8 March 1950. During the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, he was Deputy Chief of the Public Safety Station in Prijedor.
In August 1992, Bosnia and Herzegovina was the theatre of an armed conflict. Within this framework, a widespread and systematic attack was launched against the non-Serb civilian population of the municipality of Prijedor.
On 21 August 1992, a group of non-Serb prisoners, detained in the Trnopolje concentration camp, were informed that they would be “exchanged” and transported to Travnik. That same morning, several hundred civilian men, women and children gathered in the village of Tukovi. They had been told that a convoy would be organized that day to Travnik.
The two groups of vehicles from Tukovi and Trnopolje joined and proceeded in the direction of Travnik. The convoy stopped in a wooded area where the military-aged non-Serb men were separated from the women, children and the elderly. The group of non-Serb men was then driven to a location called Korecanske Stijene where there is a sheer rock face on one side of the road and a steep cliff on the other. The prisoners were ordered to leave the bus with their heads down and to kneel at the edge of the cliff. Allegedly, the police then started firing at the men. Apart from twelve persons who survived the massacre, it is estimated that more than 200 men were murdered.
According to the indictment, Dusan Jankovic was not present when the 200 men were selected and shot, but had ordered and organized the operation, while the others who were indicted participated and helped in escorting the convoy, consisting of more than 1,200 civilians in at least 16 buses, tractors, trucks and trailers.
