facts

Getachew Terba was district governor and a lieutenant in the Ethiopian armed forces during Colonel Mengistu Haile Mariam’s regime. Mengistu Haile Mariam commanded the junta, also known as the “Dergue”, “Derg” or “Coordinating Committee of the Armed Forces, Police, and Territorial Army” which overthrew Emperor Hailé Sélassié’s government during a bloody coup d’état in 1974. Mengistu Haile Mariam’s regime repressively governed Ethiopia until 1991; dissidence and opposition were not tolerated.
Between 1977 and 1978, Getachew Terba was accused of supporting the detention, torture and execution of 5 alleged rivals to Mengistu Haile Mariam’s regime who were believed to belong to the Ethiopian Democratic Union and the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front during the “Red Terror” campaign.
The Office of the Special Prosecutor was established in Addis Ababa in 1992 with the mandate to compile a historic record on the abuse committed by Mengistu Haile Mariam’s government and to initiate trials against any individuals judged to be responsible for human rights violations. The Addis Ababa Federal High Court investigated records of nearly 2500 defendants accused of genocide, war crimes and aggravated murder. The trials began in 1994 and were subject to frequent adjournments. Certain expert reports suggested that the Court had trialled defendants who did not have access to lawyers or who could only afford lawyers with little experience.
In 1997, the Addis Ababa Federal High Court carried out an investigation and initiated trials against nearly 5000 individuals charged with genocide and war crimes during Mengistu Hailé Mariam’s regime. Almost half of these individuals were already detained; those who remained, including Getachew Terba, were charged in absentia.
