facts

Paul Kagame was born on 23 October 1957 in Tambwe commune, in Rwanda’s Southern Province. After his family moved in Uganda, he completed secondary education at the Ntare School of Mbarara, and at the Old School of Kampala. From 1979, he served in Yoweri Museveni’s National Resistance Army. When the latter became president of Uganda in 1986, Paul Kagame had the rank of major in charge of military intelligence. In 1987-1988, he was one of the founders of the Rwandese Patriotic Front (RPF). In 1990, he received military training in the US. From late 1990 until July 1994, he was the leader of the RPF. He then became Vice-President of Rwanda until March 2000 when he became President. He is married and has four children.
On 6 April 1994, the plane of the incumbent president of Rwanda, Juvenal Habyarimana, was shot down killing twelve persons, including Juvenal Habyarimana himself and the President of Burundi. This event triggered the beginning of the genocide of Tutsis committed in Rwanda. The genocide reached an end when RPF forces, commanded by Paul Kagame, captured Kigali and overthrew the government in place.
Paul Kagame is allegedly responsible for having planned and ordered the shooting down of President Habyarimana’s plane. In 2006 a French investigative judge determined that Paul Kagame was allegedly responsible for ordering the shooting down of the plane. That finding was confirmed in 2008 by a Spanish investigative judge.
Additionally, it is estimated that, as it was progressing towards Kigali, the RPF systematically killed between 25’000 and 40’000 Hutus. According to Human Rights Watch, “given the disciplined nature of the RPF forces and the extent of communication up and down the hierarchy, commanders of the army must have known of and at least tolerated these practices”.
In 2010, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights published a report implicating RPF forces for crimes committed after their takeover of the country in 1994. It alleged that from 1994 until 1996, RPF forces carried on widespread and systematic attacks against Hutus refugee populations on the Territory of Democratic Republic of Congo.
Paul Kagame is the incumbent president of Rwanda and is as such immune to national prosecution. In June 2009, ICTR Prosecutor Hassan Bubacar Jallow informed the Security Council that so far he did not intend to produce an indictment related to crimes committed by the RPF.
