Zdravko Bozic, a Bosnian Serb, was born on 3 May 1964, in the village of Lasva, in the municipality of Zenica. He was a member of the Serbian military police in its Bratunac brigade and as such was said to have worked together with Mladen Blagojevic, Zeljko Zaric and Zoran Zivanovic (see “related cases”).
In 2003, Zdravko Bozic was granted refugee status in the USA in the town of Phoenix (Arizona). He was expelled in 2006, when the authorities discovered that he had obtained his residence permit by lying about his past.
According to the indictment, the co-defendants Zdravko Bozic, Mladen Blagojevic and Zoran Zivanovic were guards at locations where thousands of Muslims were being detained. Between 2’000 and 3’000 Bosnian Muslims were being held in the primary school of Vuk Karadzic in the town of Bratunac. These people had been transferred from the Srebrenica enclave. It was alleged that Zdravko Bozic, Mladen Blagojevic and Zoran Zivanovic abused, beat and inflicted cruel treatment on these detainees.
Furthermore, Bozic and Blagojevic were said to have taken part in the execution of at least five civilians during the night of 13 to 14 July 1995.
Finally, according to the indictment, on 14 July 1995 Zdravko Bozic, Zeljko Zaric, Mladen Blagojevic and Zoran Zivanovic, locked and mounted guard on the premises of the Grbavci school in Orahovac in the Zvornik municipality. Between 1’000 and 2’500 detainees were held at this location. The defendants were alleged to have beaten and inflicted ill treatment on these detainees.
On 30 June 2006, the United States handed over Zdravko Bozic to the Bosnian authorities, who placed him under preventive detention.
