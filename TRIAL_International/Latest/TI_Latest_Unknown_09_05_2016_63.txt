facts


Milos Zekic was born on 30 August 1963 in Kladanj, Bosnia.  Zekic was a soldier in the Bosnian Serb Army during the Bosnian War.
Zekic was allegedly involved in killing four people with a rifle in the locker rooms of the Sekovici stadium in Sekovici, Bosnia, where Bosniak civilians from the villages of Osmaci and Memici were imprisoned in mid-May 1992.  Zekic allegedly shot through the window of the facility following the refusal of a guard to open the door and give him the keys, thus killing the four Bosniaks.
The Bosnian State Investigation and Protection Agency requested an arrest warrant for Zekic on 11 September 2014 after Zekic did not turn up for a court hearing.  The Bosnian State Investigation and Protection Agency believed that Zekic had gone on the run near Sekovici in north-eastern Bosnia, where the alleged crime was committed.
