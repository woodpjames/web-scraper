Forcibly disappeared brothers: new complaint against Algeria
25.08.2008
The case of Djamel and Mourad Chihoub submitted to the United Nations Human Rights Committee.

The Advocay Center – TRIAL (ACT), representing Djamel and Mourad Chihoub’s parents, lodged an individual complaint against Algeria before the United Nations Human Rights Committee in August 2008.
It is the nineth individual communication brought by the ACT against Algeria.
Djamel and Mourad Chihoub disappeared after having been arrested by members of the Algerian army on 16 May 1996 and 13 November 1996 respectively. Their family, despite tireless efforts, never obtained from the national authorities any information regarding their fate or whereabouts.
The ACT requests the Human Rights Committee to declare that Algeria violated the fundamental rights of both Chihoub brothers as well as their parent’s, and that, as a result, redress should be granted.
