Facts

Philippe Hategekimana, alias Biguma, is a former police officer from the Nyanza commune near Butare in southern Rwanda.
He is suspected of having participated in the genocide against Tutsis in Rwanda in 1994. He was allegedly involved in the organisation and commission of multiple atrocities in Nyanza and the surrounding villages in April 1994. He is suspected of the following crimes: the assassination of a Tutsi mayor, the massacre of Colline de Nyamure, where thousands of people died, and the massacre of Colline de Nyamugari, where nearly 300 Tutsis were killed. In addition, Hategekimana is alleged to have organised roadblocks, where he is said to have called for the killing of Tutsi.
After the genocide, Hategekimana fled to France and settled in Mordelles near the western city of Rennes. He obtained French citizenship and changed his name to Philippe Manier.
Shortly before his arrest in March 2018, he left France to go to Cameroon.
