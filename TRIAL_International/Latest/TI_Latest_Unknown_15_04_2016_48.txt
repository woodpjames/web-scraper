Zoran Berga was a serviceman in the Army of the Republika Srpska of Bosnia during the war in Bosnia in 1992-1995.
On 23 September 1992, Berga, accompanied by other army members and police officers of the Serbian Republic of Bosnia, was said to have participated in the murder of several Bosniak civilians from Orasac and Ripac, in the municipality of Bihac. This event occurred as the latter were carrying out their civilian duties which consisted of picking plums in the village of Duljci.
Berga and his companions were then reported to have removed the bodies elsewhere in order to cover up their crime.
In 2000, seven bodies were found and exhumed and were able to be identified as a result of DNA tests, which also revealed that the youngest victim was only 13 years old.
The other bodies could not be located.
In 2011, an arrest warrant was posted by the Prosecutor of the canton of Una-Sana in Bosnia Herzegovina, against Berga and four other suspects-Jovica Tadic, Zoran Tadic, Zeljko Babic and Goran Mihajilovic.
Berga was arrested on 15 September 2011 and placed in detention in Bihac.
