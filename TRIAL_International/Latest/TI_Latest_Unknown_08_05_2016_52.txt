facts

Abdul Jabbar was a member of the Jatiya party, the nationalist party supporting Hussain Mohammed Ershad during the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971. Jabbar retired from the political scene around 1988.
He is accused of crimes against humanity during the months of the civil war.
He was indicted for the murder of two freedom fighters in the Phuljhuri region, and for burning down around one hundred houses in Nathparha and Kuluparha in the Pirojpur district. Jabbar is also accused of murdering a man and burning down more than 300 houses in Phuljiuri. Additionally, he is accused of murdering 11 people and burning down 60 houses in the village of Noli in the Priojpur district. Jabbar is also suspected of forcing more than 200 Hindus to convert to a different faith in the Phuljhuri region. Forced conversions often lead to job loss, isolation, and even the mistreatment of people who have converted to a new faith who no longer belong to the society from which they came. It is a type of religious persecution, which, when it is undertaken against a defined group of people, is a crime against humanity. Jabbar is also accused of detaining 37 people in the districts of Angulktata and Mathbarhia, of whom he eventually killed 22 and seriously injured others.
On 11 May 2014, the International Criminal Court 1 began legal proceedings against Jabbar and an investigation began on 19 May 2014.
