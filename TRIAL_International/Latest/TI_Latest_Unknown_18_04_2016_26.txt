José Rubén Lo Fiego was born on 9 May 1949 in Rosario in the Province of Santa Fe, Argentina. He received his primary and secondary education in the traditional Sacred Heart College and his father was a member of the Intransigent Radical Civic Union (a former social democrat party).
On 31 January 1972 Lo Fiego became a sergeant officer to the “Comando Radioeléctrico” of the federal police. He then moved to the 17th police station, working on personal safety and in April 1976 he became an auxiliary official to the “Servicio de Informaciones” an intelligence division of the provincial police, which was used as a detention center from 1976 until 1979. It was informally termed El Pozo, “The Pit”, and La Favela “The Favela”.
According to several witnesses, Lo Fiego was the main torturer of the Regional Unit II of the Santa Fe police and of the clandestine detention centre of the Servicio de Informaciones. This is where he gained the nick names of Doctor Mortensen and Mengele.
He also allegedly participated with Mario Alfredo Marcotte, Rito Ramón Vergara, José Carlos and Ricardo Miguel Antonio Scortechini in a group commanded by the former Chief of Police Augustin Feced, conducting repressive operations including illegal deprivation of liberty, aggravated murder, threats and torture on 87 victims.
Accused of kidnapping, murder, torture and enforced disappearances, he was arrested in 1984.
