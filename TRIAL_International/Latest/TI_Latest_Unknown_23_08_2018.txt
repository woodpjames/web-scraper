Opening of a trial for crimes against humanity and war crimes in South Kivu
23.08.2018
On 23 August 2018, the South Kivu military tribunal opened a trial in the town of Kalehe against two leaders of the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), an armed group that was operating in the area. The Court will have to decide whether commanders Kabumbre and Rafiki Castro were responsible for the bloody attacks that targeted two villages in South Kivu in May 2012. At the heart of a conflict between militia and armed forces, the survivors of the massacres, supported by TRIAL International, are demanding justice and reparation.
