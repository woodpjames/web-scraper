Raymond Girouard was born on 19 July 1983 in Springfield in the State of Minnesota, USA. In 1989, he moved to Sweetwater in Tennessee where he was brought up by his grandparents. As Staff-Sergeant in the 3rd combat Brigade of the 101st Airborne Division of the American Army, he served two missions in Iraq with this unit.
On 9 May 2006, a group of four soldiers including Girouard, were given the mission to go to a location where, supposedly, there was, a training camp for Iraqi rebels close to the Muthana chemical site beside the Thar Thar canal in Salaheddine province. There, they arrested three individuals for questioning, subsequently freeing them, and giving them the order to move on. As they did so the soldiers then gunned them down with bursts of automatic gunfire as they were running away. The American soldiers were then said to have mutilated their own faces, in order to make it seem as if the prisoners had put up a fight before fleeing and that the soldiers had only then fired upon them as they tried to escape.
The report of the enquiry written by Lieutenant-Colonel James Daniel, concluded that the soldiers had deliberately killed the prisoners, following which they then tried to cover up the facts by saying that the Iraqi prisoners had deliberately tried to escape In addition they were said to have threatened another US soldier with death if he talked about what had taken place. “You had better say nothing, otherwise I promise I will kill you”, Raymond Girouard is reported to have said to Bradley Mason, according to the indictment.
Sixty days after the event, a lieutenant in the same division as the convicted soldiers, gave testimony to the Criminal Investigation Division of the Army concerning the death of the three prisoners, in exchange for an amnesty for associated events for which he was under investigation.
The four soldiers were subjected to legal proceedings by the American judicial authorities for these acts.
