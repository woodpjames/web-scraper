Oliver Ivanović was born on 1 April 1953, in village Ranić, near Dečani. He grow up in the town of Kosovska Mitrovica, Kosovo, where he finished elementary and secondary school.  After three years in the Military Academy in Zagreb, he completed his studies at the Faculty of Economy in Priština.
During the Kosovo war, Ivanovic was a member of the Serb paramiliaty group called “Bridge Watchers”, which patrolled the main bridge in Mitrovica dividing the town into Serbian and Albanian sectors. The group protected north Kosovska Mitrovica from intrusion by Albanian extremists from the southern part of the city. Ivanovic, in his capacity as chief of the so-called “Bridge Watchers” group, reportedly ordered the murder of four ethnic Albanians, which took place in the southern part of Kosovska Mitrovica on 14 April 1999, during the armed conflict in Kosovo and NATO bombing of Serbia.
According to the Special Prosecution Office of Kosovo, it seems that Ivanovic also incited the killing of ethnic Albanians during unrest on 3 February 2000, itself sparked off by an incident in which a bomb was thrown into a cafe in north Mitrovica and left 14 Serbs injured.
Following the conflict in Kosovo, Ivanovic went on to become a apolitician in Serbia, most notably as leader of the “Freedom, Democracy, Justice” (SDP) political party.
In the elections of 23 February 2014, Ivanovic ran for mayor in north Kosovska Mitrovica as the candidate of the Citizen Initiative SDP.
On 27 January 2014, Ivanovic was arrested, at the request of the Special Prosecution Office of Kosovo. He was detained “as an alleged suspect in an ongoing war crimes investigation”, according to the EU rule-of-law mission in Kosovo (EULEX).
