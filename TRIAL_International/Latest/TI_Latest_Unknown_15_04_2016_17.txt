facts

Antanas Gudelis was born in Lithuania in 1912.
He allegedly commanded a Nazi collaborating military unit, which allegedly shot a number of civilians in the Lithuanian town of Kupiskis on three occasions. Between June and August 1941 prisoners of the Kupiskis jail, mainly Jews and communists, were brought to different killing sites because the prison was overcrowded: Gidamin Street, the Jewish cemetery and the Slavantziskis forest. The victims were beaten, otherwise tortured and then shot in large pits, which had been dug beforehand. According to Soviet court files, 7,000 people were killed. Gudelis allegedly gave the order to start shooting.
Pursuant to documents collected by the Simon Wiesenthal Centre, a Jewish Non-governmental organization which pursues a campaign of bringing Nazi war criminals to justice, Gudelis became an officer in the Third Auxiliary Police Battalion. As such, he was sent to severeral towns in Southern Lithuania, including most likely Leipilingas, Slerija and Simna. According to German documents from World War II and testimonies of two witnesses, over 800 Jews were shot on this mission led by Gudelis.
In 1949 Gudelis emigrated to Australia via Germany and obtained Australian citizenship in 1958.
When it became generally known that Australia had become a save haven for foreign war criminals, the Australian government decided to establish a Special Investigation Unit (SIU) in order to find and prosecute war criminals. The SIU took up investigations in 1989 and an initial list of 22 Lithuanian suspected war criminals was handed over from the Simon Wiesenthal Center to the SIU. Concerning Gudelis, the SIU concluded after two years of investigation that there was insufficent evidence to refer the case to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP).
