First feedbacks for the training “videos against impunity”
22.09.2017
In 2017, TRIAL International and the NGO WITNESS have put together a unique training in DRC: how to use video to fight impunity.
TRIAL International usually teaches purely legal notions; it is the first time it offers training on information technologies for judiciary purposes.
Congolese lawyers have learned to document and collect evidence for international crimes armed solely with their cameras or smartphones.
The training’s content, feedback from participants and comments from the organizers can be found on Storify.
