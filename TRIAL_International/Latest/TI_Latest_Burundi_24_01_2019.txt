In Burundi, a victim of torture still in danger
24.01.2019
Arbitrary arrest, incommunicado detention, torture – Benjamin went through hell in 2015. Unfortunately, years later, he is still living with a sword of Damocles hanging over his head. Why? His persecutors never had to answer for their actions… and might repeat them.
Ever since April 2015, the democratic space in Burundi has shrunk dramatically; civil liberties have been restricted; insecurity has soared and human rights violations have multiplied. These crimes have gone almost entirely unpunished, as the government in Bujumbura further isolates itself from the international community.
In this context, Benjamin (real name withheld) was arrested by a group of policemen in June 2015. He was forced to get into a vehicle and was held incommunicado for several days.
In detention, Benjamin suffered the worst forms of abuse: torture, humiliations and threats. At least three times a day, his torturers would persecute him to make him “confess” that he was fighting for the opposition.
