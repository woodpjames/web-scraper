facts

Sebastiao Rodrigues de Moura was born on 15 December 1934 in Sao Sebastiao do Paraiso, Brazil.
During the Brazilian military dictatorship (1964-1985), Rodrigues de Moura allegedly was the chief of the military intelligence in the fight against rebels. He allegedly used information obtained from rebels under torture.
Rodrigues de Moura took a specialized class on the techniques of Jungle warfare, organized by the army. During the years 1960-1970, he was responsible for the Amazonian State of Para, where he put in place a military intelligence unit in order to annihilate the Araguaia guerrilla. He was known under the codename of “Marco Antonio Luchini”. One of his techniques was to sell food and armaments to itinerant merchants, knowing these armaments were destined to the rebels. This enabled him to gain the confidence of those merchants, who then permitted him to localize guerrilla camps.
Rodrigues de Moura allegedly abducted and tortured many activists during the repression against the Araguaia guerrilla. Their fate is still unknown today. He is also suspected of having participated in the massacre of 41 combatants.
On 14 March 2012, seven prosecutors of the working group “Transitional Justice” who were working on the crimes committed during the military regime, launched criminal proceedings against colonel Rodrigues de Moura for the enforced disappearance of 5 activists between January and September 1974.
