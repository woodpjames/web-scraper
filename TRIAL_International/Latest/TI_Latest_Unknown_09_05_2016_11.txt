Jerry Shumate is originally from Marlock, Washington, United States. He is an infantryman who enlisted in February 2005. The acts that are described below were committed during his first posting in Iraq.
On 26 April 2006 at approximately 2:00 am, a group of Marines went to Hamdania, a small village west of Baghdad, to perform a search. They were supposedly looking for Iraqis planting Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs). They went to the home of Hashim Awad Al Zobaï, a 52-year-old father of 11 children. They seized him and bound his hands before forcing him to walk through the scene of an ambush that had occurred previously between the US military and the Iraqi insurgents. There they bound his feet and forcefully pushed him into a crater that had been left by an explosive device. The marines then retreated and some, including Shumate, shot at him whilst he was bound at the bottom of the hole while others fired into the air with a Kalashnikov that had been stolen previously to make it seem that a “battle royal” was taking place. Shumate claimed that he thought he was “told to fire” by the squad leader and fired between 10 and 20 rounds at the detainee.
Once the man had died, the Marines scattered the bullet casings from the Kalashnikov around his body and placed the weapon at his side. Before leaving, the Marines also untied his feet and legs. Their objective was to make it look as though Al Zobaï had been caught trying to install a roadside IED, and that his death had resulted from a regular skirmish. The following day, local police found the body and asked neighbours to identify it.
Seven marines and a Navy medic, of whom Shumate, were prosecuted by the U.S. military authorities for conspiracy, kidnapping and murder relating to the homicide of Al-Zobaï in Hamdania. The charges were officially filed on 21 June 2006. Six of the accused, including Shumate, pleaded guilty.
