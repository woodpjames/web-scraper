Case Bholi Pharaka v. Nepal 
At the age of nine years old, Mr. Bholi Pharaka (assumed name) was sent to work in Kathmandu to provide for his family. In the household that employed him, he was subjected to forced labour and daily abuse. When he was fourteen he finally managed to flee this nightmare, only to be arbitrarily arrested, detained and tortured by Nepalese police officers. Since then, Mr. Pharaka and his family have relentlessly sought justice, but to date no one has been prosecuted for these crimes, nor was the victim granted any form of reparation. In May 2016, TRIAL submitted a complaint on behalf of Mr. Pharaka before the United Nations Human Rights Committee, aiming at finally obtaining justice and redress.
