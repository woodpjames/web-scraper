Radomir Susnjar, otherwise known as “Lalco”, is accused by several Bosnian and Serbian witnesses of being involved in the murders of 59 Bosniaks, who were burnt alive in Visegrad during the conflict. In June 1992, approximately 70 people – mostly women, children and elderly persons – were locked up in a room of a house. The building was set on fire and, despite trying to escape by climbing out of the windows, most of the victims were killed.
The eight survivors, two of whom died a few years later, were able to testify before the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague. “Lalco” is accused of personally locking the room where the civilians were, and of setting the building on fire.
Radomir Susnjar had been hiding in France for many years. TRIAL International managed to trace him in the Parisian region and informed the Bosnian and French authorities of this. In 2014, Radomir Susnjar was arrested and has since been the subject of extradition proceedings.
On 6 October 2017, he was charged in Bosnia and Herzegovina for the alleged murder of Bosniak civilians.On 18 June 2018, the French Council of State validated his extradition request.
