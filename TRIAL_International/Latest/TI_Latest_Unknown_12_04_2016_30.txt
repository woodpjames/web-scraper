Darko Hudak was a member of the Territorial Defense Forces (TDF) of the Yugoslav Republics in the self-proclaimed autonomous oblast of Krajina in the Vukovar region in Croatia.
Between August 1991 and May 1992, the DTF together with the Yugoslav Peopleâ€™s Army fought against the forces of the Republic of Croatia on behalf of the Serbian minority which was seeking to secede from the Republic of Croatia.
In May 1992, Hudak was deployed in the village of Miklusevci.
During that time, the DTF took control of the village where many non-Serb civilians were subjected to extreme violence and killed. Specifically, on 18 May 1992, six non-Serb civilians were subjected to extreme violence and four civilians were killed.
