A UN decision and years of lobbying have been necessary for Alma M. to uphold her rights. Now, at last, she has received tangible acknowledgment of her sufferings. 
What can be worse than experiencing the enforced disappearance of a loved one? Experiencing it, and then remaining in limbo for two decades, neglected by the authorities. This is what happened to Alma M. (real name withheld) in BiH.
Her husband was a member of the military when he was forcible disappeared. His family last saw him alive in August 1992, and had never known what happened to him. Now at long last, their right to reparation has been enacted.
For the first time since her husband was disappeared, Alma M. has received the pension she is entitled to: a happy conclusion to a long and exhausting battle.
