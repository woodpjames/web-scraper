facts

Nedeljko Milidragović, also known as “Neđo”, “Pajo” or “Lega”, was born 10 January 1958 in municipality of Sokolac, Serbia.
Milidragović was a Platoon Commander of the Training Centre Jahorina of the Special Police Brigade within the Ministry of Interior of the Republika Srpska. During the armed conflict in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1995, the Army of Republika Srpska and the Ministry of Interior of Republika Srpska carried out a widespread and systematic attack (now referred to as the Srebrenica genocide) against the Bosniak civilian population from the United Nations safe area of Srebrenica. In the period of 10 to 19 July 1995 Milidragović was allegedly involved in the Srebrenica genocide.
Prosecutor of the Special Department for War Crimes within the Prosecutor’s Office of Bosnia and Herzegovina issued an indictment against Milidragović, charging him with the following:
– to have on 12 July 1995 during the search of the wider area of Potočari found a disabled Bosniak man, who could not move, inside a house, fired a gun and killed him;
– to have on 12 July 1995 isolated a group of fifteen to twenty men from “Bijela kuća” (White House) and escorted them to a nearby field where they were killed one by one, by a single pistol shot;
– to have ordered execution of about hundred prisoners in the warehouse ZZ Kravica;
– to have on 17 and 18 July 1995 during the search of a forest area located above the Bratunac – Konjević Polje road, fired a gun and killed two prisoners who had surrendered. Having captured a group of about fifty Bosniak men and boys and gathered them on the road, he singled out one boy aged 10-13 year old and issued an order to a unit member who took the boy away and killed him. The rest of the group of captives, whose hands were tied behind their back, were escorted by the accused into a building in Konjević Polje and have been missing ever since.
On 19 July 2012 the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina confirmed the indictment under which the accused Milidragović is charged with the criminal offense of genocide in violation of Article 171(a)(b) of the Criminal Code of Bosnia and Herzegovina (CC BiH) in conjunction with Article 180(1) of Criminal Code of Bosnia and Herzegovina (individual criminal responsibility).
