Raúl Antonio Guglielminetti, also known as “el mayor Rogelio Guastavino”, was born on 2 November 1941 in Buenos Aires.
In 1968 he started his career as a bodyguard of politician and he was a member of the security of the Casa Rosada (seat of the Executive Power of the Argentina Republic) between 1968 and 1981.
In the seventies, Guglielminetti joined the Triple A (Argentine Anticommunist Alliance), a right-wing parastatal group converted in death squad created within the framework of the Perón government (1973-1976) to eliminate and persecute the left-wing opponents.
In 1974, he was recruited by the Intelligence Services of the Army as a PCI (Civil Officer of Intelligence) and from 1976 he was part of the Intelligence Battalion 601. The Battalion 601 depended of the Headquarters II of the Army Command. This Battalion conducted intelligence analysis, infiltrated guerrilla and human rights organisations, detained and made disappear persons suspected of being opponent of the military regime.
From 1978, Guglielminetti was in charge of the External Tasks Group of the Intelligence Secretary of the State (SIDE) which activity was the laundering of the funds of drug trafficking behind the facade of companies based in Miami (Argenshow y The Silver Dollar). This operation permitted the transfer of more than 30 million dollars to secret military operations in Central and Sur America.
As a civil officer of Intelligence of the army, Guglielminetti worked in several clandestine detention centres in Buenos Aires and Neuquén: Atlético (1976-1977), Banco (1977-1978), Olimpo (1978-1979) and “Automotores Orletti” (1976). The ex-mechanical workshop known as Automotores Orletti, was used in 1976 as an operation base for local and foreign intelligence forces. It was estimated that almost 200 prisoners went over this place. According the report of several Human Rights organisations, Guglielminetti participated at illegal repression of several prisoners in these clandestine centres.
After the military regime in 1983, Guglielminetti was appointed bodyguard of the President Alfonsín and operated in the intelligence parallel group “Alem” which devoted itself to execute attacks and kidnappings. This group was unarmed after the scandal caused by the kidnapping of the businessman Osvaldo Sivak.
At the beginnings of 1984, Guglielminetti moved to Spain.
