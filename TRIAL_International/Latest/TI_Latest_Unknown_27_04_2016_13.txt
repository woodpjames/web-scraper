Egyptian police captain Islam Nabih worked for the Boulaq police station.
In 2006, Egyptian internet users posted images to Youtube of serious physical harm inflicted on Emad Al Kabir. The young bus driver suffered at the hands of the Egyptian police whilst detained at the Bulaq al-Dakrur police station in January 2006. The video shows police captain Islam Nabih and low-ranking officer Reda Fati sodomizing Al Kabir with a stick. It was shared throughout the Mediterranean blogosphere and was used to denounce Moubarak’s government. In one of the videos, a police officer lets loose on a suspect, relentlessly beating his face whilst the man raises his arms in protection before crumpling to the ground. Having impaled their victim, the perpetrators then filmed the scene with their mobile phones. They then burned it onto a CD and passed it around amongst ‘microbus’ drivers as a warning against resistance to the police.
These videos showing police brutality were never shown on Egyptian television. Islam Nabih and his fellow police officer worked at the station in Boulaq, a working-class neighbourhood in Cairo.
Once Wael Abbas and other bloggers shared videos filmed using phone cameras, and after a few attempts to intimidate the torture victim, the authorities eventually referred the two officers to the tribunal.
