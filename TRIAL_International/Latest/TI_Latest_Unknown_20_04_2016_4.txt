Anton Lekaj, also known as Pinqo, was born in 1980. He was a member of the “Cipat” group of the military police forces within the Kosovo Liberation Army (UCK).
It is alleged that on 12 June 1999, in the context of the conflict between the UCK and the Serbian forces, Anton Lekaj and other members of the UCK unlawfully captured 13 civilians attending a Roma wedding ceremony in the city of Dakovica. The detainees were tortured before being transferred to premises of the Pastrik Hotel where they were held for four days. During that time, Anton Lekaj and other members of the UCK allegedly continued to torture and subject them to inhumane and degrading treatments, including mutilations, rapes and other sexual harassments, beatings with wooden sticks and cigarette burns. One of the victims was stabbed to death.
Two days later, on 14 June 1999, Anton Lekaj‘s group was ordered to release six of the victims. During the night of 15 June they also transferred the remaining detainees to a different place where three persons were allegedly killed.
