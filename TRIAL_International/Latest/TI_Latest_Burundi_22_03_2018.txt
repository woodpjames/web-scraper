Burundi: a coalition of local and international NGOs denounces a “campaign of terror”
22.03.2018
An oral statement to the Human Rights Council (HRC) on March 13 reports an alarming observation of human rights violations in Burundi. Indeed, these violations continue to be committed in Burundi in complete impunity.
Following the adoption of a draft revision of the Burundian Constitution, a true campaign of terror was initiated in order to force the population to vote “yes”. This draft revision would particularly enable Pierre Nkurunziza to court two new seven-year mandates.
In the face of this situation, ACAT-Burundi and SOS-Torture/Burundi, supported by the CCPR Centre, FIACAT, OMCT and TRIAL International have invited the concerned bodies to work towards finding crisis recovery solutions.
