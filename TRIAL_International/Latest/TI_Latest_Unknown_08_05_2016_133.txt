facts


Javal S. Davis was born in Roselle, New Jersey, in 1977. In 1994, he started work as a tool salesman. He joined the US army as a reservist of the 372th military police company. In May 2003, his company was sent to Iraq and deployed in Abu Ghraib prison.
In late 2003, rumours started circulating that members of the US army had been mistreating and torturing Iraqi detainees in Abu Ghraib prison. In January 2004, Joseph Darby, a member of the US military police, informed the army leadership about these abuses and supplied the officer in charge with photographic material. The pictures documented scenes in which naked Iraqi detainees were being beaten and forced to simulate sexual acts.
At the end of January 2004, the commander-in-chief of the multinational troops in Iraq, General Ricardo Sanchez, instructed General Antonio Taguba to set up an inquiry into the affair. The findings of his investigation were handed over to the authorities in charge on 4 April 2004.
The so-called Taguba report (see “links”) concluded that American soldiers carried out acts of humiliation which severely violated international law. It stated that numerous ‘sadistic abuses’ were inflicted upon detainees of Abu Ghraib between October and December 2003. The guards had set up their own rules, which were condoned more or less explicitly by their superiors.
The report cited numerous examples of maltreatment towards detainees, such as physical and sexual abuse, torture, intimidation by use of military dogs and the threat of rape and killing.
The report specifically named seven suspects: Ivan Frederick II, Charles Graner, Sabrina Harman, Megan Ambuhl, Jeremy Sivits, Lynndie England, Megan Ambuhl (see “related cases”) and Javal Davis.
Javal Davis was indicted by the US Army on 12 May 2004.
