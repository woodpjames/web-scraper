Slobodan Mišljenović was born on 18 July 1940 in Croatia. Before the Croatian War of Independence, Mišljenović worked as a teacher at the local elementary school in Mikluševci for decades.
On 8 October 1991 the Yugoslav People’s Army occupied the village of Mikluševci. Subsequently, Mišljenović allegedly became the head of the village council from the autumn of 1991 until January 1992. It is also alleged that Mišljenović was a member of a Croatian Serb paramilitary group called Štaba teritorijalne obrane Mikluševci, meaning Mikluševci defence forces. The paramilitary group was associated with the Yugoslav People’s Army. The paramilitary group was allegedly led by Jugoslav Mišljenović.
The village of Mikluševci in Croatia was inhabited by Croats, Serbs but mostly Ruthenian people. The Mikluševci defence forces aided by the Yugoslav People’s Army occupied the village on 8 October 1991 until 18 May 1992. Witnesses claimed that once Mišljenović took over the city council the community was organised along ethnic lines. The members of the Mikluševci defence forces harassed, intimidated, robbed and persecuted the non-Serb inhabitants of the village (Croats and the local Ruthenian minority). The village council and the defence forces held a joint session on 25 November 1991 and, according to the minutes, drew up a list of people to be expelled from Mikluševci.
Allegedly, Peter Lenđer and Jovo Cico, two members of the paramilitary group, killed the members of a Ruthenian family Julijan, Veronika and Mihajlo Holik in the Jelaš woods near Mikluševci village. Members of the paramilitary group also killed Slavko Hajduk, and Đuro Biki, Eugen Hajduk, Vlatko Ždinjak, Mihajlo Hajduk, Emil Mudri, and Željko Hirovati were beaten and totured.
The Vukovar Police Administration initiated criminal investigations, including against Misljenovic, on 19 January 1993.
