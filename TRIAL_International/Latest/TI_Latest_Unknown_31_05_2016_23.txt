facts

Sebastien Nzapali was born in 1952 in the Democratic Republic of Congo (previously Zaire). He was a member of Mobutu’s presidential guard and, in the period between 1990 and 1995, he led the death squads which spread fear and terror throughout the streets of the capital, Kinshasa. In 1996, he was Commander of the Garde Civile, stationed in Matadi.
During this time, Nzapali allegedly instructed his bodyguards to arrest a customs agent in the port of Matadi. These bodyguards were then said to have taken the victim to the premises of the Garde Civile, locked him up in one of the cells and subjected him to systematic torture for a number of days, on the orders of the defendant. The victim was beaten, in a half naked state, with a whip and then, was severely beaten. After having been abused for a number of days, the victim was freed.
After Mobutu’s fall in 1997, Nzapali escaped to the Netherlands.
