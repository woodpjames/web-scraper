Mijo Banovic was a member of the Croatian Defense Council (HVO) military police, the main military force of Croats in Bosnia, during the Bosnian War.
Banovic allegedly beat and mistreated detainees in Dretelj, a detention camp located in Bosnia and Herzegovina, from July to September 1993.
Banovic beat several detainees with a rifle butt, wooden stick, fists and legs, and forced the detainees to beat each other. It is further alleged that Banovic forced detainees to lie naked on hot concrete. The indictment also alleged that the detainees were forced to look into the sun and to jump on each otherâ€™s stomachs.
Witness Mustafa Hodzic, a former member of the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina, told the Trial Chamber that Banovic, whom he recognised in the courtroom, tortured him and other detainees in Dretelj detention camp.
On 16 April 2013, the Cantonal court in Mostar, Bosnia, confirmed an indictment against Banovic, charging him with having committed war crimes against Bosniak civilians and prisoners of war, who were held in Dretelj detention camp, during 1993.
