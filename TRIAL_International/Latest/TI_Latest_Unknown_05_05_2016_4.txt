facts 

Edin Dzeko, a Bosnian national, was a member of the Zulfikar Unit of the Bosnian army, which was supposedly a subordinate of the main army, during the Croat-Bosniak war.
Dzeko was accused of having participated in the killing of three civilians and three Croatian Defence Council (Hrvatsko Vijeće Obrane, HVO) fighters. The HVO was the first official military formation of the Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia and the first military force with the objective of controlling areas populated by Croats. The crime occurred in the village of Trusina, near Konjic and Jablanica, Bosnia and Herzegovina, on 16 April 1993.
Dzeko has also been accused of the murder of an elderly couple, Ilija y Andja Ivankovic, during the conflict in Trusina.
Furthermore, according to the accusations, in September of 1993, Dzeko himself ordered that three of his colleagues beat a victim using wooden sticks and concrete blocks. This act took place in the Rogica housing complex, where the Zulfikar Unit’s base was situated.
However, the accusation was contested even though in September 1993, Dzeko removed the victim, Mirko Zelenika, from the housing complex and took him to Jablanica. In Jablanica, while receiving death threats, he forced Zelenika to pay 3,500 Marks, acquired from his acquaintances and relatives, in exchange for his life. While in Jablanica Dzeko was also accused of participating in the illegal detention of nine Croatian civilians.
Dzeko’s trial began in 2012, after his extradition from the United States of America in 2011.
