Désiré wanted to escape a violent fate, but the insecurity in Burundi claimed him
03.06.2016
Désiré (not his real name), a Burundian citizen, had joined the National Liberation Forces (FNL) movement when he was scarcely more than a child. After his demobilization, he decided to live a peaceful life with his wife and their child.
But the calm was short-lived. In 2010, a wave of insecurity swept across the country after the opposition contested the elections. Political opponents were systematically persecuted. There was, in particular, a significant surge in extrajudicial executions.
During this time, Désiré was arrested for the first time by a State agent who tried to bribe him to get hold of the names of the FNL leaders.
Following Désiré’s refusal, several law enforcement officers tried to kill him at his home a few months later. Left for dead, the victim was hospitalized for several months in a very critical condition.
No sooner had he left the hospital, the authorities put pressure on him once more, forcing Désiré to flee the region. These precautions were insufficient to put an end to his ordeal, however, because Désiré was abducted and executed in July 2011. He was 28 years old at the time.
