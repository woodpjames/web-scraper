Pero Vincetic, a Bosnian-Croat, is allegedly responsible for the inhumane treatment of imprisoned Serb civilians, detainees from the village of Bukova Greda in Orasje and members of the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS) in several locations including at schools serving as detention centres in Donja Mahala and Orasje, Bosnia Herzegovina.
Vincetic allegedly participated in the torture and killings of several Serb civilians in the municipality of Orasje between May 1992 and June 1993. Some of the victimsâ€™ ears were pierced with staplers, their fingers were cut, they were tortured with electricity, beaten and forced to perform humiliating acts.
Vincetic allegedly had immediate control over the detention buildings in Donja Mahala and Orasje and knew or should have known about the daily abuses going on there and did nothing to prevent or penalise the alleged perpetrators.
Vincetic allegedly helped other members from different HVO units in taking prisoners to perform forced trench digging where some of them were killed.
Vincetic and other unidentified HVO members also allegedly jointly participated in the unlawful arrest, detention and physical abuse of a civilian in a house in Donja Mahala, Bosnia and Herzegovina. Vincetic then allegedly transferred the civilian to the school building in Donja Mahala, where he unlawfully held him in detention until the end of June 1992.
Vincetic also allegedly participated in the rape of one person on several occasions and enabled one of his subordinates to do the same. Vincetic then allegedly forced the person to tell him where she kept her golden jewellery and money. He later took her back to her house and threatened her so that she would not report the rape.
In December 2010, the Bosnia Herzegovina Prosecution indicted Vincetic for torture and the killing of civilians and prisoners of war in the Orasje area between May 1992 and June 1993.
