facts

Jasko Gazdic was a soldier in the Army of the Serb Republic of Bosnia during the war in the former Yugoslavia.
In 1992, the Foca municipality fell into the hands of Serb forces. The city numbered around 40â€™000 inhabitants, of which half were Muslims. The Serb authorities reportedly separated the men and women and illegally detained thousands of Muslims and Croatians in several detention centers such as Buk Bijela, the Foca high school or the Partizan sports center. During the arrests numerous citizens were said to have been beaten or killed. Many of the detained women were allegedly subject to humiliating and degrading living conditions, seriously beaten and subjected to sexual violence, namely rape. In addition to the detention centers mentioned above, a number of women were reportedly held in houses or apartments which served as brothels managed by groups of soldiers, who were, for the most part paramilitaries.
Gazdic was found guilty of participating in these events being fully aware that his acts were part of the overall attacks by the army of the Serb Republic. Between April 1992 and March 1993, using force and intimidation, Gazdic raped two women and a 12 year old girl who were being held in the Partizan center. He also allowed other soldiers to carry out rape against the women concerned, notably by threatening them with their firearms.
Gazdic was arrested in April 2011 and remanded in custody pending his trial.
