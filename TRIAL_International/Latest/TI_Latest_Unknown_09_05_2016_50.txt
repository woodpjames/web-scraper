Inocêncio Fabrício De Matos Beltrão served as a Major in the Brazilian military during the dictatorship from 1964 to 1985.
The murder of Virgílio Gomes da Silva is considered to be the first of 136 assassinations of dissidents during the military dictatorship. Gomes da Silva was a trade unionist and important figure in the resistance movement. He had participated in the abduction of back then Ambassador of the United States Charles Burke Elbrick from 4 to 7 September 1969.
Gomes da Silva was arrested in the morning of 29 September 1969 in São Paulo and brought to a military prison where he was tortured. He was left hung on an iron bar, hands and feet tied together and severely beaten. He died of his injuries the same evening. His corpse was found later in a waste land in São Paulo. However the authorities considered him to be disappeared and his mortal remains have not been entirely localized until today.
