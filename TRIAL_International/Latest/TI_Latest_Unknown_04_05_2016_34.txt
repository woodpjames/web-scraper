facts 

Blagoje Simic was born on 1 July 1960. He was educated as a doctor. He wielded important political functions in his region.
These were: President of the Serbian Democratic Party of Bosanski Samac from 1991 to 1995; Vice-President of the Municipal Assembly from 1991 till 17 April 1992; Member of the self-proclaimed Assembly of the “Autonomous Serbian Region of Northern Bosnia”, subsequently entitled the “Autonomous Serbian Region of Semberija and Majevica” of the “Serbian Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina” from at least 4 November 1991 to 30 November 1992. On or around 17 April 1992, he was named President of the “Municipal Assembly of Samac”, later renamed the “War Presidency of the Serbian Municipality of Bosanski Samac”.
He was indicted for planning, instigating and ordering, in collusion with other political figures, a campaign of persecutions between 1 September and 31 December 1993, whose aim was to get rid of the non- Serbian population living in the Municipalities of Bosanski Samac and Odzak. The Serbian authorities in so doing arrested and imprisoned a large number of individuals and forced many civilians to abandon their homes. They also disseminated discriminatory rules and regulations concerning the non-Serbs, insisted that the great majority of them be put into forced labour and undertook a large scale appropriation of their personal and commercial property.
In carrying out this project, led Blagoje Simic reportedly committed serious violations of international humanitarian law, most notably by participating in acts of torture.
Before 17 April 1992, the Municipality of Bosanski Samac was made up of close to 17’000 Muslims and Croatians living in Bosnia against an overall population of around 33’000. In May 1995, there remained less than 300.
Blagoje Simic surrendered voluntarily on 12 March 2001 and was transferred on the same day to the ICTY (International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia).
