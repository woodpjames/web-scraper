facts


Slavko Lalovic, a Bosnian national, was born on 19 July 1959 in the village of Vihovici, in the municipality of Kalinovik in Bosnia Herzegovina. Lalovic was a caterer by trade and carried out his military service in the Yugoslav People’s Army.
During the war in Bosnia Herzegovina, Lalovic was a reserve police officer in the Kalinovik public security department. Over the summer of 1992, many Serbian soldiers turned the Miladin Radojevic primary school into a prison, where they illegally held many civilians. Lalovic was then transferred to the prison’s surveillance team.
Although he was a guard at Miladin Radojevic prison, Lalovic supposedly committed many acts of abuse against the civilians who were being held there. He also supposedly deprived the prisoners of water and of the use of toilets. Lalovic seized the civilian’s personal belongings by threatening them and their children at gunpoint.  At the end of August 1992, Lalovic allowed soldiers from the Republika Srpska Army to enter the school in order to rape some of the detained civilians.
On 18 May 2010, Lalovic was arrested by the Bosnian authorities and was immediately remanded in custody.
