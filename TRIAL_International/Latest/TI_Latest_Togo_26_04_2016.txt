Shigenori Togo was born on 10 December 1882.
As a career diplomat he was given a post at the Japanese Embassy in Germany in the 1920â€™s. He was appointed Ambassador to Germany in 1937.
From 1938 to 1941, Shigenori Togo held the post of Japanese Ambassador to Moscow.
In 1941, Togo was appointed Minister of Foreign and Colonial Affairs in the cabinet of Prime Minister Tojo. In this position, he played an important role in the pre war negotiations with the United States, whilst at the same time supporting the position of those willing to go to war, a situation which led the allies to accuse him of duplicity. After war was declared, he collaborated with the other members of the cabinet concerning the conduct of the war in the Pacific and in China. He resigned in September 1942 following a dispute within the cabinet concerning the manner in which to treat the occupied countries since he was against the more aggressive policy of Tojo.
In April 1945, after three years being spent out of power, Shigenori Togo was invited back into government and appointed again Minister of Foreign Affairs and Greater East Asia in the Suzuki cabinet. Being in favour of putting an end to the war he supported the Potsdam Declaration. Throughout the summer of 1945, he argued on the side of the Japanese surrender. On 9 August following the bombing of Nagasaki and Hiroshima, he was one of the three ministers in the Supreme War Council who was in favour of surrendering.
At the end of the war, Shigenori Togo was arrested by the allies and imprisoned in Sugamo.
