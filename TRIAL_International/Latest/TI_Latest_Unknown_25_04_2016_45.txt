facts

Vehid Subotic was born on 29 May 1973 in Doboj, Bosnia and Herzegovina. He was a member of the Second Battalion of the Seventh Muslim Brigade of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina during the Bosnian War, which took place from 1992-1995.
Subotic is accused of ordering the murders of eight Croat civilians during a period of armed conflict between the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH) and the Croatian Defense Council (HVO) in Dusina, Bosnia and Herzegovina.
On 26 January 1993 at approximately 5:30 AM, Subotic allegedly led members of the Second Battalion in surrounding Dusina and capturing 40 Croat civilians, along with several disarmed HVO soldiers. Subotic then purportedly ordered members of the Second Battalion to randomly select eight Croat civilians to be killed. The selected civilians were supposedly taken inside of Ivica Kegele’s (one of the 40 captured Croats) house, questioned about the location of the HVO’s weaponry, and physically beaten. Subotic then allegedly ordered members of the battalion to line up the eight civilians and shoot them.
In 2010 the Prosecutor’s Office in the Zenica-Doboj Canton of Bosnia and Herzegovina charged Subotic with the killing of civilians in the area near the villages of Dusina, Lasva and Visnjica.
