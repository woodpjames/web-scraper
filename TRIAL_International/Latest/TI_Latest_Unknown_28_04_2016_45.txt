Milorad Ulemek was born on 15 March 1968 in Belgrade, Serbia. After finishing a course as an auto mechanic, he went in France to join the French Foreign Legion in 1986. At this occasion, he earned the nickname of ‘Legija’.
In 1992, he left the Legion and came back to Serbia in order to become the instructor, then deputy commander of a paramilitary group, the ‘Arkan’s Tigers’, that was accused of having committed a variety of war crimes during the conflict in ex-Yugoslavia.
Once the group of the ‘Arkan’s Tigers’ disbanded and the war ended, Milorad Ulemek joined the Special Operations Unit of Serbia’s secret police, named the ‘Red Berets’.
He was dismissed of his functions in 2001 but continued to maintain relations with the special services of the former regime of Slobodan Milosevic, and with organized crime, especially with the Zemun gang.
Milorad Ulemek was involved in the murders of several Serbian politicians.
On 3 October 1999, the former Deputy Prime Minister of Yugoslavia Vuk Draskovic escaped an assassination attempt, known as the Ibar Highway assassination attempt, which cost the life of four of its collaborators. Milorad Ulemek was accused of taking part in the attack.
In 2000, the former President of Serbia, Ivan Stambolic, disappeared. Three years later, his body was found in woods outside Belgrade. The police revealed that Serbs who were members of the secret police, including Milorad Ulemek, had murdered him.
He was also accused of masterminding the murder of Zoran Djindjic in 2003, former Prime minister of the Republic of Serbia. Opponent of organized crime, he played a leading role in the transfer of Slobodan Milosevic to the ICTY. He was never found after the commission of the murder.
Milorad Ulemek surrendered to authorities on 2 April 2004, while the trial of the assassins of Zoran Djindjic had started a few months earlier in front of the Serbian jurisdictions.
