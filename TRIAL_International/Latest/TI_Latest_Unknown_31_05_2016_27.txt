facts

Emmanuel Nteziryayo was born in 1963. He is the former mayor of the commune of Mudasomwa in Gikongoro province.
Nteziryayo was charged with instigating the killings of 85’000 people during the genocide and of having provided weapons to the Interahamwe (extremist Hutu militia).
In addition, Nteziryayo was accused of both provoking and leading one of the biggest massacres of the Rwandan genocide, that of 21 April 1994 in the Murambi school. From more than 50’000 people who had sought refuge in the classrooms, only a handful survived the attack by the Interahamwe, who were armed with firearms and machetes.
For three years after leaving Rwanda, Nteziryayo lived in Manchester under a false identity. He had asked for asylum in Great Britain for himself, his wife and their five children, before his name appears on a list of suspects published by the Rwandan government in April 2006.
