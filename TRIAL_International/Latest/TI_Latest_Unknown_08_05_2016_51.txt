facts


Soniboj Škiljević was born on 14 August 1948 in Izgori, Gacko Municipality, Bosnia and Herzegovina. From mid-December 1992 until mid-December 1995 he was a warden of the Butmir Penal and Correctional Institution (Butmir KPD) in Kula, Ilidža Municipality, Bosnia and Herzegovina. This institution functioned as a detention camp. During this time, the Serb Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, later Republika Srpska, directed a widespread and systematic attack against the non-Serb civilians of the city of Sarajevo.
Škiljević, together with his colleague Radoje Lalovic, was responsible for Butmir KPD, and for the actions of its guards. In addition to its primary purpose as a regular prison, the Butmir KPD also functioned as a camp where non-Serb civilians were detained from May to December 1992.
Hundreds of non-Serbs, particularly Bosniaks, were detained at Butmir KPD in inhumane conditions, staying in overcrowded rooms with no heating during the winter, provided with very little food and deprived of medical care. Detainees were not informed of the reason for their detention, and no legal proceedings were ever initiated against them
Non-Serb detainees at the Butmir KPD were also subjected to physical abuse, harsh interrogations and forced labor. Some of them were killed while performing forced labor. Some prisoners were also taken to unknown locations and executed.
On 30 December 2008, the Prosecutor’s Office of Bosnia and Herzegovina issued an indictment against Škiljević and Lalović. They were charged with crimes against humanity, specifically persecution, including murder, enslavement, imprisonment, torture, and other inhumane acts, for their role in the Butmir KPD. The indictment was confirmed on 31 December 2008.
