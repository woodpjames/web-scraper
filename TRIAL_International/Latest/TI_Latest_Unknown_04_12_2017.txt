Kavumu: A psychologist alongside traumatized children
04.12.2017
My 17 years of experience with children have been used to help the young victims of Kavumu. I work at Gonesse hospital, in the suburbs of Paris which is where I met a medical examiner from PHR. After attending my consultations, she asked if I would be interested in using my experience to help the young Kavumu victims. That is how I found myself joining the local players.
I have not been surprised by the details of the Kavumu case since sexual assaults on children are part of my everyday work. The distinctive aspect of this case, compared with those that I encounter, is the kidnappings and torture executed massively and systematically. Here, the crimes seem to have been committed as part of a defined plan. It is the serial nature of these assaults which contributes to the extremely complex character of the case.
I am of Senegalese origin and have now been living in France for 27 years. That is where I studied psychology. I have had a diverse career. First, I worked in a therapeutic and socio-educational association for children and adults victims of violence. Then, I worked in the maternity and pediatric psychiatry field, as well as working for a victim support service (UNAVI).
