facts

Hervé Madeo is a French citizen. As the director of TOTAL MYANMAR EXPLORATION PRODUCTION (TMEP) from 1992 to 1999, Madeo was responsible for the operations of TOTAL on Burmese territory.
He was involved in a pipeline project in the region of Yadana. In the area of Tenasserim, military battalions were responsible for the security of the pipeline project. Even though TOTAL and its management were aware of frequent and systematic human rights violations perpetrated by these battalions, they are alleged to have given them moral, financial, logistical and military support.
Several reports by human rights organizations, testimonies by victims of forced labour and TOTAL’s internal documents would have proven that TOTAL and their management were fully aware of the crimes their military partners were committing.
TOTAL supposedly paid compensation to 463 victims of forced labour between December 1995 and January 1996, which indicated that they were clearly aware of the seriousness of the situation.
The crimes against humanity perpetrated by the security forces were thought to have had the support of TOTAL; as a result, the firm might therefore have been considered as an accomplice in these crimes.
On 25 June 2002, charges were brought against Hervé Madeo in Bruxelles by four victims of human rights violations, which had taken place in Myanmar. Then, in August 2002, two Burmese citizens (one of them was 13 at the time of the incidents), both victims of forced labour in the Myanmar pipeline project, filed a complaint in front of the French jurisdictions. They accused the French corporation, TOTAL, of illegal imprisonment.
