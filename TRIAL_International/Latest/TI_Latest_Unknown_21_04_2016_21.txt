facts

Luciano Menéndez was born in 1927 in the Buenos Aires suburb of San Martin. He enrolled in the Colegio Nacional de Guerra and was appointed Chief of the 5th Mountain Infantry Brigade during the Independencia Operation against groups of the left wing.
In 1975 he was appointed Chief of the 3rd Army Corps. As the military commander of ten Argentine provinces, he ordered the arrests of hundreds of people (syndicalists, students, professors, journalists and anyone else suspected of sympathizing with the left wing). His disagreement with the military leadership led him to start an insurrection in 1979, but it was crushed. He was imprisoned for 90 days, dismissed from his post and forced into retirement by the General Viola.
Menéndez died on 27 February 2018 at the age of 90 in a hospital in Cordoba, Argentina.
