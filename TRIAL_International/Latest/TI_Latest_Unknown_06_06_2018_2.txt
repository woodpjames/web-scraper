Facts

Charles Ndereyehe Ntahontuye is from Cyabingo commune, Rwanda.
In 1992, along with other Rwandan intellectuals, he created the Progressive Republican Circle, a group that was considered extremist because of his incitement to commit genocide against the Tutsi. The same year, Ndereyehe left the presidential party to found the Radical Hutu Coalition for the Defense of the Republic, which will play a crucial role in the genocide.
In 1993, he became director of the Institute of Agricultural Sciences of Rwanda (IASR) where he allegedly ousted of important positions members who did not share his anti-Tutsi ideas. In March 1993, he also reportedly supervised the recruitment and training of a militia to implement the genocide.
In April 1994, he reportedly led meetings at IASR to prepare for the genocide and the plan to leave no Tutsi survivors at IASR and vicinity. The plan is implemented at the end of the same month: on 26 April 1994 more than 300 people were killed during the massacre. In May 1994, he allegedly provided significant financial support for the genocide by allocating part of the IASR budget to operations against Tutsis and as a reward for the perpetrators of crimes against Tutsis.
In 1994, Ndereyehe fled Rwanda to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), where he created a politico-military movement based on the ideology of genocide, the Republican Assembly for Rwandan Democracy â€“ RDR.
He lives in the Netherlands today where he continues his political activities. He is one of the leaders of the unregistered United Democratic Forces (FDU-Inkigi), an alliance with RDR, which has links with the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR). He also coordinates the activities of groups that share an ideology similar to that which gave rise to the genocide.
