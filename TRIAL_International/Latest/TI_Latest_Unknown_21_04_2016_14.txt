facts

Jorge Eduardo Acosta was born on 27 May 1941 in Argentina. Jorge Eduardo Acosta (not to be confused with Jorge Exequiel Acosta, another Argentinean military accused in another tribunal) did all his career in the Navy, beginning in the Naval College. In 1975, he is sent to the Superior School of Mechanics of the Navy (ESMA) in Buenos Aires.
In 1976, under the order of Admiral Massera and with the military Junta’s agreement, the Navy opens “Working Units” (Grupos de Trabajo – GT) which are to be the Navy death squads, with GT 332 based in the ESMA. This GT is composed of 50 military, most of them from the Navy, under the command of Rubén Jacinto Chamorro, now deceased.
The GT332 was specialised in interrogations, torture and the so called “flights of death”, during which opponents to the regime were thrown either from a helicopter into the Rio de la Plata or from an airplane flying off the coastline. The school’s elegant building, situated on one of Buenos Aires’ most opulent avenues, was the nerve centre for the repression of thousands of students, teachers, lawyers or trade union members between 1976 and 1983.
In 1977, Acosta becomes head of Intelligence and soon he becomes the head of GT 332. As such, it is him who allegedly decides who is to live and who is to die thrown into the sea from a Navy airplane. He also allegedly participated in tortures to prisoners. He heads the GT at the ESMA until the end of 1978. It is estimated that out of approximately 5.000 people who passed through the ESMA, only 200 survived.
In 1981, Acosta travels to South Africa where he works as a counter-intelligence counsellor to the apartheid regime. In 1984, he retires.
Arrested under the accusation of crimes against humanity when democracy returned to Argentina in 1984, he benefits from the Raúl Alfonsín government Due Obedience Law (Ley 23.492) and Final Point Law (Ley 23.521), followed by an amnesty decreed by President Carlos Menem in 1990.
In 1988, a retired policeman names him as the person responsible for the murder of a known Argentine journalist, Rodolfo Walsh, in 1977.
In October 1997, a Spanish judge asks for his extradition accused of having murdered and “disappeared” Spanish citizens, and for crimes against humanity.
In 1998, a judge finds that Acosta had opened a bank account in Switzerland and is suspected to feed it with the money stolen from the ESMA prisoners.
In 2003, the amnesty laws are repealed and Acosta is again arrested in the case “systematic plan” under the accusation of having sold babies born from women prisoners in the ESMA.
In 2006, Federal Oral Court (TOF) n° 5, in Buenos Aires re-opens the ESMA file. Eighteen marines, including Acosta, are accused of crimes against humanity in three different cases:
1. 75 cases of disappearances and kidnappings
2. The ‘Church of Santa Cruz’ case: where many heads of the Association of the Mothers of the Plaza, seven family members of missing persons and two French nuns were detained by soldiers in December 1977. All of these individuals disappeared. On 29 August 2005 however, seven of the bodies were found, including that of one of the French nuns. They were discovered 400km away from Buenos Aires in the small town of General Lavallea, in a mass grave in the town’s cemetery, and were identified by their DNA.
3. The assassination of Rodolfo Walsh, journalist and member of the Montoneros kidnapped by militaries on 25 March 1977.
