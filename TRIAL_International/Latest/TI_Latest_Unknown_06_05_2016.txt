Azemin Sadikovic was born on 5 June 1972 in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. He was a member of the armed forces of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
An attack by the armed forces of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina against Kasatìci village in Hadžići municipality of Bosnia and Herzegovina began during the night of 24 May 1992 and, even though they were poorly armed, the people of Kasatìci tried to resist it in order to protect civilians.
Despite their efforts, the people of Kasatìci could not stop the attack and many civilians were killed that night.
It is alleged that, during this attack, Sadikovic took civilians Dejan, Jovanka, Aco and Srdjan Milosevic family out of the basement they were hiding in and shot them.
In January 2013, the indictment for criminal offenses for war crimes against Bosnian civilians was filed by Prosecution of Bosnia and Herzegovina. A month later the case was transferred to the Sarajevo Cantonal Court.
