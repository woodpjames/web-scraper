CBI to face legal hurdles for extradition from 158 countries despite Law Commission’s recommendations to apply death penalty only in terror cases
August 31, 2015
New Delhi:  Asian Centre for Human Rights in its report, “India: Not Safe for Extradition of those facing Death Penalty?” released today stated that despite the Law Commission’s recommendations for speedy abolition of the death penalty from the statute books, except in cases where the accused is convicted of involvement in a terror case, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) will face legal hurdles from 158 countries while seeking extradition of suspects and accused including those accused of terrorism. The Law Commission of India is expected to submit its report to the Supreme Court of India and the Government of India today i.e. 31st August 2015.As on 31st July 2015, the CBI had issued about red corner notices to 650 suspects/accused either to face prosecution or to serve a penal sentence. Of these, 192 wanted persons have been charged under laws that provides for death penalty as punishment such as under the Arms Act, Indian Penal Code, the Maharashtra Control of Organized Crimes Act, the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act and the Prevention of Terrorism Act of 2002.  Out of 192 wanted persons, 124 are wanted for committing terrorist offences.However, the execution of three terror convicts i.e. Ajmal Kasab , Afzal Guru  and Yakub Abdul Razak Memon  in the last three years has seriously impacted India’s requests for extradition from a number of countries which have abolished death penalty.A total of 140 countries have abolished death penalty and further, a total of 158 countries have ratified the UN Convention Against Torture which under Article 3 prohibits return (“refouler”) or extradition of a person to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture. Apart from the European Union, Canada, Mexico, South Africa and Philippines seek assurance that the death penalty shall not be carried out in case of extradition of those charged with offences carrying death sentence.India has failed to secure extradition of Mohammed Hanif Umerji Patel @ Tiger Hanif, an alleged associate of the underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, who is wanted in India for his role in two terror attacks in Surat city of Gujarat in January and April 1993.“If the government of India can give assurance to Portugal that death penalty shall not be imposed on Abu Salem who has been accused of the same offences for which Yakub Memon had been hanged, there is no reason as to why death penalty cannot be abolished altogether. It is the fear of the law, not necessarily death penalty, that can act as deterrent.” – stated Mr Suhas Chakma, Coordinator of the National Campaign for Abolition of Death Penalty. [Ends]The full report,  India: Not Safe for Extradition of those facing Death Penalty?, can be accessed at:  http://www.achrweb.org/reports/india/India-Not-Safe-for-Extradition-of-those-facing-Death-Penalty.pdf
