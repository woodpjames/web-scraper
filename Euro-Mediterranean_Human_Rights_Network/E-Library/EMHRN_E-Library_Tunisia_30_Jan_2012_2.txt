French To mark the first anniversary of the beginning of the Tunisian revolution, a delegation of the Mission of the Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Network in Tunisia, accompanied by the Regional Consultant of the Euro-Mediterranean Foundation for the Support of Human Rights Defenders, travelled to the southeast of Tunisia, in particular to Tataouine. The delegation participated to the public celebration of the anniversary of the revolution, in the presence of local authorities. The visit was also an opportunity to meet with several associations in the house of the people that was transformed into a complex hosting several associations created after the revolution. Besides, the delegation was received by the Association of Human Rights in Tataouine which organised a panel discussion on the occasion of the launch of an initiative of coordination of local associations called “Centre for Research and Studies for Human Rights “, which aims to gather information on the situation of Human Rights in the region. The theme of the decentralisation of powers and its impact on marginalised areas was at the heart of the debate. A play summarising the final phases of the Tunisian Revolution was played at night at the theatre of Tataouine. This visit was an opportunity to ensure a follow-up to the previous visits made ​​by the EMHRN in the South (particularly in December 2011) and to start the elaboration of a training plan that addresses the specific needs of the associations seeking to benefit from capacity building activities that the EMHRN organises.
