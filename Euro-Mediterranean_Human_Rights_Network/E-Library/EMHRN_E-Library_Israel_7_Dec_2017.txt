Israel / OPT,
Press Release December 07, 2017 EuroMed Rights and its Israeli and Palestinian member organisations sent a letter to the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Federica Mogherini and the Foreign Affairs Ministers of the 28 EU Member States ahead of their meeting with Israel’s Prime Minister Netanyahu on 11 December. The letter calls on EU leaders to firmly uphold a human rights-based approach to the conflict and to challenge Israel’s continuous disregard for international law. Commenting on the subject, EuroMed Rights President Michel Tubiana said: “The meeting takes place as the occupation of the Palestinian territory enters its second half-century and despite the clear signals from the Israeli government that it has no intention of reversing this reality. In spite of the clear condemnation by the international community and the EU, Israel has over the past months accelerated its settlements construction in the West Bank, increased house demolitions and advanced a policy of de facto annexation of Area C. In addition to that, we are witnessing an increase in restrictions on civil society and human rights defenders, aimed at weakening criticism of Israel’s human rights violations and occupation policies. The EU has for too long acquiesced to Israel’s continued occupation and systematic human rights violations, undermining its own credibility and leverage over the parties. To avoid rewarding the Israeli government for its appalling human rights record, we call on EU leaders to use this occasion to denounce the Israeli government’s systematic violations of human rights, including Palestinians’ right to self-determination.” The letter can be viewed here.
