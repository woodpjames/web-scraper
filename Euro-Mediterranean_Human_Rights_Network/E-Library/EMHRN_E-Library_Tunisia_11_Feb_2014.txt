Tunisia February 11, 2014 ANHRI Calls on Tunisian Authorities to Protect Journalists and Opinion Makers The Arab Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI) today denounced the ongoing attacks on journalists, media professionals, and opinion makers either by citizens or state apparatus employees, due to practicing their work. “Sofiane Ben Farhat”- journalist at “La Presse” newspaper- and his companions, were severely beaten with sticks and batons by a group of four people while they were leaving a hotel in Sulaiman district at Nabeul governorate. Noteworthy, a person calls himself “Bossbat”, who was one of this group, went to speak with the journalist in the hotel’s garage; telling him that his father was among the political prisoners of “Renaissance Movement” for 3 years. He threatened the journalist to Punish him because he criticized Ali Al-Areed’s government. Thereafter, three other people joined “Bossbat” and they all started to beat the journalist and his escorts. ANHRI said “The incident of attacking the journalist “Sofiane Ben Farhat” and his companions appears to be a continuation of the series of targeting journalists, media professionals and opinion makers; either by citizens or state apparatus employees. Such an incident came shortly after the assault on “Al-mutawasit TV” crew by some employees at the General Federation of Labor in Sfax, on January 29. ANHRI explained that the assault on the journalist was due to his ongoing criticism to Ali Al-Areed’s policy together with “Renaissance Movement”, during last period, through TV programs broadcasted on some TV channels. ANHRI demanded from Tunisian authorities to quickly arrest the culprits , and to bring them to a prompt and fair trial; especially that the journalist had described them and gave their car number to security bodies.
