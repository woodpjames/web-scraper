Shrinking Space for Civil Society September 27, 2017 All States should take a strong stand to address reprisals and to support the crucial resolution “Cooperation with the United Nations, its representatives and mechanisms in the field of human rights” (A/HRC/36/L.26). The resolution is currently being negotiated at this 36th session of the Human Rights Council. In a letter co-signed by 49 national and international NGOs to Human Rights Council members, it is mentioned that “A weak resolution would seriously undermine the ability of the UN system to address the needs on the ground“. One underlines as well that “Beyond the grave impact on the life of persons concerned and their relatives, intimidation and reprisals also constitute an attack on human rights, the rule of law, and the international and regional mechanisms themselves.” This resolution on reprisals provides a timely and much needed opportunity for the Council to react towards the growing incidences of intimidation and reprisals that have been reported in the Secretary-General’s most recent report on reprisals. EuroMed Rights would like to stress in particular, as reported by the Secretary-General’s report; We would like as well to call attention to the case of the prominent human rights lawyer Ibrahim Metwally in Egypt, arrested two weeks ago, while being en route to the Working Group on Enforced and Involuntary Disappearances session.
