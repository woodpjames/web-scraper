Arabic Copenhagen, 27 January 2015- After yet another deadly confrontation between police forces and peaceful demonstrators in Egypt, the Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Network (EMHRN) is appalled by the killing of more than 20 peaceful protestors marking the fourth anniversary of Egypt’s January 25 revolution. “Peaceful protest is a fundamental right, which should be upheld in any circumstance. No use of excessive force or arbitrary arrest against peaceful demonstrators can ever be justified. This shocking incident happens in a context of relentless crackdown on human rights organisations and dissent in Egypt and raises serious concerns as to how serious the Egyptian authorities actually are when they committed to shifting the country towards democracy”, said EMHRN President Michel Tubiana. “Security forces involved in violent incidents against Egyptians participating in peaceful demonstrations must be held accountable. Egypt should also safeguard the right to free assembly, by cancelling its deeply restrictive new Protest Law”, added Tubiana. Read our statement on the fourth anniversary of Egypt’s Jan 25 revolution
