Arabic Press Release Brussels, 27 September 2018 Today the Italian Minister of Interior, Matteo Salvini, visits the Tunisian President, Beji Caid Essebsi, and the Minister of the Interior, Hechem Fourati, in Tunis. Migration, expulsions and security will be on top of the agenda. This follows the recent approval by the Italian Council of Ministers of the new decree on migration, which would see a dramatic reduction of the rights of migrants, refugees and asylum seekers. The expected aim of this visit is the expulsion and repatriation of Tunisians and the closing of maritime borders. EuroMed Rights deeply regrets that the Italian policy leaders turn a blind eye again to the manifested will of a large portion of both the Tunisian and Italian population in favour of integration and free movement across the Mediterranean, as shown by the demonstrations and solidarity movements on both shores of the Mediterranean. Current emergency and security-oriented policies do not live up to the human rights challenges linked with migration. It is time that policy leaders shift away from short-sighted policies, including an increase in the shrinking space for civil liberties that undermines the values upon which the European Union is built.
