EMHRN and Palestinian human rights NGOs recommendations  on the new EU-PA Action Plan

Gaza Strip,
Israel / OPT,
Statement March 01, 2012 The European Union and the Palestinian Authority (PA) are in the process of adopting a new Action Plan to replace the Action Plan agreed upon in 2005. The undersigning human rights NGOs call on the EU and the PA to revise the chapters on democracy, rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms in the EU-PA Action Plan in order to reflect the deterioration of the human rights situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT) following the political split in 2006 between the authorities in the West Bank (for the purposes of this document, “the PA”) and the authorities in the Gaza Strip. Over the last 5 years, the PA has adopted a pattern of repressive measures  aiming at stifling political dissent, generating a sense of intimidation within Palestinian society, turning the latter into what resembles a “police state“ weakening democratic values and the rule of law.  Similar measures were adopted by the authorities in Gaza.  The undersigning organisations therefore call on the PA to move towards Palestinian reconciliation which has the potential of putting an end to the spiral of intra-Palestinian human rights violations. As human rights organisations we highlight the need to engage with all relevant actors in the best interests of the civilian population and request that the EU reconsiders its policy as regards the government in the Gaza Strip. Moreover, the EU should not hamper the inter-Palestinian reconciliation process and respect the will of the Palestinian people as expressed through free and fair elections, which are expected in the context of the current unity agreements between Palestinian groups. The EU should continue to provide aid and technical support to any Palestinian unity government. Click here for the full statement in English.
