Arabic  Press Release Tunis, 10 October 2018 The Assembly of People’s Representatives adopted yesterday, Tuesday 9 October 2018, the Organic Law on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination in Tunisia. The purpose of this law is to protect people against all violations and forms of discrimination, in accordance with the principles set out in the Tunisian Constitution, which enshrines the equality of all citizens in rights and duties without discrimination, and in accordance with international conventions that protect citizens against all abuses without distinction of colour, sex or creed. The Tunisian Forum for Economic and Social Rights, EuroMed Rights and the Committee for the Respect of Liberties and Human Rights in Tunisia had presented a draft law criminalising all forms of racial discrimination during a press conference held on 21 March 2016 on the occasion of the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. These organisations have also been coordinating with the Assembly of People’s Representatives, parliamentary groups and the Minister for Relations with Constitutional Bodies, Civil Society and Human Rights to accelerate discussions and the adoption of the draft law. The three organisations welcome the adoption of this law and pledge to continue their struggle, with all civil society’s forces involved, to eliminate all forms of discrimination and promote a culture of equality among all. On this occasion, they call on the competent authorities to speed up the promulgation of orders and to provide victims of racist attacks with support and legal assistance. They also call on all media to make this law known to the public in order to contribute to the spread of a culture of tolerance, acceptance of diversity and rejection of all forms of discrimination. Finally, the three organisations salute the work and commitment of the Ms Anouar Mnasri, Judge at the Administrative Tribunal, who drafted the bill, the deputies and presidents of the parliamentary groups for their efforts to adopt it, as well as all those among government representatives and civil society organisations who have contributed to this historic achievement for Tunisia.
