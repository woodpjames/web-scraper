Arabic Last Monday 23 January 2017, peace talks on the six-year Syrian conflict were held in the Kazakh capital of Astana. The talks, sponsored by Russia, Turkey and Iran, were intended to strengthen the ceasefire but also to reach a political settlement of the conflict. During those peace-talks, Russia proposed a draft to serve as a “guide” for the Syrian constitution. This initiative is largely condemned by Syrian CSOs, considering it as an offense and an attempt to undermine Syria’s sovereignty. On 1st February 2017, 43 active Syrian civil society organisations (located inside and outside Syria) released a joint-position paper entitled “It is the Syrians Who Write Their Constitution”, expressing their indignation towards Russia’s initiative. EuroMed Rights expresses its full support to the joint initiative of those 43 Syrian CSOs and shares here their joint-position paper.
