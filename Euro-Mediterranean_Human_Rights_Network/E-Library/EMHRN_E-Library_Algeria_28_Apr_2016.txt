Arabic  One year ago, on 30 April 2015, the European Parliament adopted the first resolution on Algeria for over a decade. EuroMed Rights, the FIDH, SOLIDAR and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), in the framework of the Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, welcomed the resolution calling especially Algerian authorities “to ensure the safety and security of civil society activists and human rights defenders and their freedom to pursue their legitimate and peaceful activities”. Since then, we regularly call upon European and Algerian authorities to ensure the implementation of the resolution’s recommendations. A year later, faced with a deteriorating situation, we would like to get from the European authorities, information about the concrete measures that have been taken by the European Union to implement the recommendations. Here are the letters we have just sent to Ms. Federica Mogherini, High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, and Mr Martin Schulz, President of the European Parliament.
