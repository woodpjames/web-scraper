Press Release October 07, 2013 The Interim Coordinating Committee of Refugees is organizing a mobilization outside of the Parliament today Thursday, 3 October 2013, at 15:00. The economic crisis has led the majority of refugees to unemployment, poverty, racist discriminations and social exclusion. In their majority, they live in abject destitution and no longer have access to the necessary resources for housing and food. Exactly due to the despair in which they have been driven to, as well as their reaction to a policy that aims to enforce them to leave Cyprus, the refugees’ communities are mobilizing today demanding equal treatment and equal rights for all people, without any discriminations and exclusion. The Interim Coordinating Committee of Refugees are calling all civil society organisations and organised social groups to be there and support the mobilization, demonstrating in practice their solidarity to the refugees’ communities that are living in Cyprus.
