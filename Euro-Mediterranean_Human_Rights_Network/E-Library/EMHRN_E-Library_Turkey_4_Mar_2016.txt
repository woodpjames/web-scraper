French This 7 March 2016, the heads of EU’s states and governments will meet with Turkish officials in Brussels to discuss the “EU-Turkey cooperation plan on migration”. If Turkey is a key ally in the humanitarian support of refugees from Syria, one should not ignore the very concerning developments which have stained Turkey’s human rights record over the last months. In a letter addressed today to HR/VP Federica Mogherini, EuroMed Rights expresses its deep concern about the ongoing crackdown on dissenting voices in Turkey. The network calls on to do everything to protect and stand by human rights defenders in this dismaying context.
