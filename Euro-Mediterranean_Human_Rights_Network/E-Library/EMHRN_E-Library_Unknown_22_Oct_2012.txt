Arabic Several Sahrawi activists are being prosecuted in Morocco and their trial before the military court of Rabat is expected to start on 24 October 2012 after having been postponed once. The evacuation of the Geeim Izik camp near Laayoune in November 2010 is at the source of the events that led to the arrest of these people. The conditions of the trial, the fact that civilians are being judged by a military tribunal and allegations that the defendants were tortured and mistreated have prompted the Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Network to ask Michael Ellman, former lawyer, to go to Rabat in order to obtain additional information and monitor the trial. He will report back his observations. The EMHRN has asked the Moroccan government to facilitate his mission.
