Arabic 15th of March 2013 marked the second anniversary of the Syrian revolution. UN figures report that more than 70,000 persons have been killed while tens of thousands have disappeared or remain stranded at the borders so far. To make a stand against the spiraling violence that the Syrian population is enduring, EMHRN and its members came together and helped creating a White Wave for Syria ! This campaign was organised by the White Wave Committee and supported by many NGOs*       To see the pictures of the event click here To see a video of the manifestation in Brussels click here For more information visit the website: http://www.vagueblanchepourlasyrie.org *The event was supported by the Euro- Mediterranean Human Rights Network, Amnesty International France, the FIDH, Human Rights Watch, the LDH, Reporters sans Frontières, Souria Houria, Déclaration de Damas, Collectif du 15 mars pour la démocratie en Syrie, OMCT, ACAT, Appel d’Avignon, Ordre des avocats de Paris and Collecti urgence solidarité.
