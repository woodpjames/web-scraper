French Today, 26 December, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the President of the Republic of Turkey, arrives in Tunisia for a two-day official visit. On this occasion, EuroMed Rights’ President, Michel Tubiana, calls on Tunisian President Béji Caïd Essebsi: “Tunisia cannot ignore the growing repression of civil society in Turkey. We denounce the massive retaliation and arbitrary measures taken against academics, journalists, activists and all peaceful opponents of the regime who demand freedom of thought and expression. Since the attempted coup in Turkey on 15 July 2016 and subsequent proclamation of a state of emergency, the authorities have ignored fundamental rights and freedoms. Since then, a veritable witch-hunt has taken place, caracterised by daily arrests, abusive dismissals in the public services, including justice and education, as well as in the media. In total, nearly 130,000 civil servants have lost their jobs. It is time that the basic rights of citizens, as enshrined in international law, be respected in Turkey. It is unacceptable that an entire nation should continue to be muzzled, forbidden to assemble in peaceful demonstration, subject to arrest, torture and confiscation of their passports. It is the duty of our leaders to persuade Mr. Erdoğan, that basic human rights, inalienable in international law, be reinstalled in Turkey.”
