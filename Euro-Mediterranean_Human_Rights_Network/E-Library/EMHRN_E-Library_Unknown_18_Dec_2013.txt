Arabic The Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Network  (EMHRN) and the Gulf Centre for Human Rights (GCHR) express their deep concern following the arbitrary detention of human rights defender, Abdulhadi Sheikh Awad. He is the director of the Syrian Democratic Institute and has been involved also in aid efforts in the context of the conflict in Syria. According to information received, Abdulhadi Sheikh Awad was arrested at the immigration office, close to the Syrian-Lebanese border, on 8 December 2013, by members of the governmental security forces while he was heading to Beirut. He has been denied access to lawyers and to his family. Reports confirmed that still no charges were brought against him. It is believed that the detention of Abdulhadi Sheikh Awad is solely related to his peaceful and legitimate humanitarian activities. The Syrian government has prosecuted a number of civil society and humanitarian activists before the Anti-Terrorism Court, a special court enacted in July 2012 by the Syrian government that fails to comply with international standards of fair trial and due process. The EMHRN and GCHR urge the Syrian authorities to: – Immediately and unconditionally release human rights defender Abdulhadi Sheikh Awad; – Immediately ensure that Abdulhadi Sheikh Awad has an unfettered access to his lawyer and family; – Take all necessary measures to guarantee the physical and psychological integrity and security of Abdulhadi Sheik Awad while he remains in detention; – Guarantee in all circumstances that all human rights defenders in Syria are able to carry out their legitimate activities without fear of reprisals and free of all restrictions including judicial harassment.
