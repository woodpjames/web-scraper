Stand for Human Rights
6 Jan 2014
Campaign January 06, 2014 The European Parliament (EP), which represents the citizens of the European Union and plays an important role in the EU policy making process, has a responsibility to ensure that the EU upholds its commitment to promoting human rights and democracy inside and outside of its borders. In order to do this, the EP needs to strengthen its own approach to human rights and democracy issues. As the 2014 European elections approach, individual candidates hoping to become Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) should pledge to enhance the role of the EP as a global actor on human rights and democracy. The commitments contained in the pledge will help to ensure that human rights and democracy concerns are the foundation on which all EP policies and activities, both internally and externally, are based.
