Policy Brief October 28, 2013 2013 UPDATE OF THE EU HUMAN RIGHTS COUNTRY REPORT CONCERNING ISRAEL The Hotline for Migrant Workers (HMW) was founded in 1998 by a group of citizens concerned about the exploitation and abuse of migrant workers in Israel. With the initial assistance from the NGO Kav LaOved, the HMW addressed a critical deficiency in existing services to detained foreigners slated for deportation. Through our exclusive access to detention centres, we met more vulnerable groups in need of assistance and enlarged our mandate. The HMW is a non-partisan, not-for-profit organization defending the rights of migrants and refugees in Israel, and combating human trafficking and xenophobia. The HMW assists vulnerable individuals, particularly those held in immigration detention to protect their basic human rights and to give them a voice. For more information, please visit: www.hotline.org.il The Hotline for Migrant Workers identified several major issues of concern in its field of work: – Prolonged detention of asylum-seekers in Israel and pressure on them to leave the country – Purposeful government policy of making the life of asylum seekers in Israel miserable – Israeli Authorities’ treatment of migrant workers employed in slavery-like conditions To read this briefing please click here
