Arabic 25/11/2015 – Euro Med Rights severely condemns the attack that struck the heart of Tunis last night, 24 November 2015. EuroMed Rights extends its sincere condolences to the families of the victims, wishes a quick recovery to the wounded and shares the grief with the Tunisian population. By attacking agents of the Presidential Guard, the authors of the attacks are attempting to impair the entire country, which unanimously decided to build a democratic and peaceful State, respectful of individual and collective freedoms and that chose to embed the values of human rights in its Constitution. By negating these rights by their barbarous attacks, the terrorists also seek to hamper the evolution of the democratic process. EuroMed Rights affirms unequivocally its unshakable will to stand up to terrorism by eradicating the roots of this plague. Nothing will stop the building of a democratic State because nothing will affect our determination and our attachment to the values of justice and freedom. Never again afraid, more than ever.
