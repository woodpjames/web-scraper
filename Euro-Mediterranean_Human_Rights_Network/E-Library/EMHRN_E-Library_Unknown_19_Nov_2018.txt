Arabic Press Release Brussels, 19 November 2018  Representatives from over 150 civil society organisations, the majority of which coming from the South of the Mediterranean region, will gather in Brussels tomorrow and Wednesday for the First Majalat Civil Society Forum in order to debate four regional themes: Good Governance; Security and Countering Violence; Migration; Economic Development and Social Dialogue.

On Wednesday the session will be opened by Commissioner for European Neighbourhood Policy and Enlargement Negotiations, Johannes Hahn. Majalat is the first civil society run process of this kind.

NOTE: The project has been coordinated and set up by six organisations: Arab NGO Network for Development (ANND), Arab Trade Union Confederation (ATUC), SOLIDAR, EuroMed Network France (REF), EuroMed Rights and Forum for Alternatives Morocco (FMAS). In addition to the six partners, six organisations with a regional scope are invited to sit in the Steering Committee: Arab Campaign for Education for All, Arab Network for Human Rights Information, Disabled People International, Maghreb Observatory on Migration Transparency International and Syrian Citizens’ League. The whole process will be facilitated by an Interactive Digital Platform.
