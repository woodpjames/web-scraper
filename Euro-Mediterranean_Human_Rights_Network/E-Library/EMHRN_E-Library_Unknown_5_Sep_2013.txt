Arabic The Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Network (EMHRN), the Euro-Med Non-Governmental Platform (ENGP) and the European Feminist Initiative (IFE-EFI), as the organisers of the Euromed Civil Forum on Gender Equality held in Brussels on 3-4 September in preparation of the Ministerial Conference of the Union for the Mediterranean (UfM) of 12 September 2013, take note of the creation of a “Foundation of Women for the Mediterranean”. They regret that this initiative, which brings together the governments of UfM member countries as well as public and other institutions, perpetuates confusion among civil societies in the Northern and Southern Mediterranean and this new organisation. Also, to the extent that it purports to be the “Network of Feminist Networks”, this foundation cannot aspire to the independence and autonomy that civil society organisations in the Northern and Southern Mediterranean claim for themselves. EMHRN, ENGP and IFE-EFI regret that the UfM gave its green light to such a project without prior consultation of civil society in the region. Release “Foundation of Women for the Mediterranean”
