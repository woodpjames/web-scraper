French Today, 7 June 2016, the so-called “NGO Transparency Bill” is being discussed at the Israeli Parliament and may be brought for a final reading. This bill is only one of many other measures being taken against human rights and civil society organisations in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT). As the Knesset moves toward its final vote on this bill, EuroMed Rights and the Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders have sent a joint letter calling on the EU and its Member States to issue a firm and unambiguous statement to defend both the “shared values” said to underwrite its relations with Israel, and civil society as a key partner in promoting these values.
