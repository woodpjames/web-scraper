Press Release October 23, 2012 The Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Network (EMHRN) deplores the European Parliament’s vote for a major trade agreement between the EU and Israel today, in a move that clearly undermines the EU’s declared position on the settlements and international law. This decision to enhance the EU’s cooperation with Israel stands in stark contrast to the European parliaments’ resolution adopted last July, condemning Israeli policies, and stating that the EU’s bilateral relations with Israel must fully consider Israel’s commitment to respect its obligations under international human rights and humanitarian law towards the Palestinian population. The final vote in favour of the “Protocol on Conformity Assessment and Acceptance of Industrial Products” between the European Union and Israel, commonly referred to as “ACAA” was 379 votes in favour, 230 against and 41 abstentions.
