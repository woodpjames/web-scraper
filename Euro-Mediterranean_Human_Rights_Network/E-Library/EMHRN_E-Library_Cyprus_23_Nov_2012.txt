Open Letter November 23, 2012 Dear Mr. Louka, Thank you for replying to our delegation’s letter of 6 June 2012, addressed to the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Justice, Mr Stelios D. Himonas. This letter was submitted following the verdict of the Cypriot court acquitting Mr Doros Polycarpou, KISA’s Executive Director, of all criminal charges brought against him, following the tragic events at the 2010 Rainbow Festival on 5 November 2010 in Larnaca. We appreciate your Ministry’s efforts of in keeping us abreast of the actions taken by the authorities (letter received on 24 October 2012), in particular the administrative investigation into the two police officers’ testimonies against Mr Polycarpou, who were found to be unreliable witnesses by the judge. We also welcome the transposition in Cypriot law of the EU Council Framework Decision on combating certain forms and expressions of racism and xenophobia by means of criminal law. We hope that its implementation will help prevent discrimination in Cyprus, and will ensure that events such as those witnessed at the 2010 Rainbow Festival will not be repeated in the future. However, despite these promising developments, and almost six months after the court’s verdict, we deeply regret that some of our concerns remain unaddressed: Two years after the tragic events which occurred at the 2010 Rainbow Festival, our delegation remains concerned about the effectiveness of the anti-racism and anti-discrimination policy of the Cypriot authorities. The police force’s decision not to interfere against the violent anti-migrants and far-right march on 5 November 2010 and to allow their progression towards, and eventually their attack on, Festival participants is worrying: it downplays the danger of far-right movements by treating them “equally” with peaceful supporters of migrant rights. An effective policy should comprise justice for victims of racist crimes and the end of impunity for those who participate in their perpetration, directly and indirectly. We remain hopeful that the Ministry will take these issues seriously and urge the authorities to: – Ensure that an external independent investigation establishes who is responsible for the extreme violence witnessed at the 2010 Rainbow Festival, and that sanctions are applied in consequence; – Ensure that an independent external investigation is carried out to establish why the police force was unable to prevent the attack against the Festival participants and that disciplinary procedures are taken against the police officers who participated in the violence; – Ensure that Mr Polycarpou receives compensation for the unfounded accusations brought against him and that the two police officers who testified are sanctioned for providing the court with false and unreliable accounts; – Commit to the implementation of the above mentioned Council Framework Decision and to the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, and adopt concrete measures to monitor and stop the rise of xenophobia and guarantee the protection of minority groups, migrants, refugees and human rights defenders against racist violence and discrimination; – Uphold the rights of all victims of racist crimes and ensure proper compensation for the persons seriously injured at the 2010 Rainbow Festival; Yours sincerely, Association Européenne des Droits de l’Homme (AEDH), Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Network, European Network Against Racism (ENAR), Fahamu Refugee Legal Aid Programme, Front Line Defenders, Migreurop, Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders (FIDH-OMCT), Platform for International Cooperation on Human Rights Defenders (PICUM)
