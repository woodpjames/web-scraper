Arabic  On 3 June 2016, EuroMed Rights organised a national conference to present its publication “Violences à l’égard des femmes : lois du genre” (Violence against women: gender law) prepared by Sana Ben Achour, President of the Beïty Association. In this book, Sana goes over the challenges related to the struggle against violence against women. The conference was held in presence of Samira Maraï Friâa, Minister of women and families, who applauded the major role played by Tunisian Civil Society in the upbringing of a draft law against violence against women and girls. Many representatives of Parliament took part in this conference and have repeated their support to Civil Society, specifically regarding the fight for gender equality.
