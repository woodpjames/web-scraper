Arabic The Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Network would like to extend its deepest and most heartfelt condolences to our dear friend and colleague, Maysa Zorob following the loss of at least 15 members of her family in an Israeli attack in Rafah, Gaza on the night of 1 August 2014. Our hearts and thoughts go out to her and her family in this time of sorrow. Maysa lost at least 15 members of her family in Rafah, following some of the bloodiest and most heinous Israeli attacks since the beginning of Operation Protective Edge. Unfortunately, this attack is representative of Israel’s many indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks on civilian objects including houses, schools and hospitals which continue to occur in blatant violation of international humanitarian law and which may amount to war crimes. Over the years, EMHRN has strived tirelessly to ensure accountability and redress for victims of such violations. EMHRN deplores the complacent silence of the EU, its Member States and the international community as such grave violations continue to occur in the Gaza Strip. May you and your family find the strength to deal with this grave loss.
