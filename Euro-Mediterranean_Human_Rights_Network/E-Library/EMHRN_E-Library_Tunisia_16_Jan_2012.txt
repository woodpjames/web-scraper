Tunisia January 16, 2012 In its new report, the Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Network (EMHRN) debunks the myth behind the so called ‘Tunisian miracle’ by exposing the depth of the structural failures the Ben Ali regime had tried to cover up for more than two decades. It provides detailed evidence on the high rates of unemployment crippling the country’s economy; the lack of access to basic medical care, corruption-related issues and the staggering numbers of young Tunisians seeking European shores in search of a better life.
The report high-lights the fact that EU decision makers seem to think that past social and economic support programs remain valid today and need little or no revision. While welcoming the flourishing debates about Tunisia’s future constitutional and political system the report argues for a pressing need to also deal with Tunisia’s economic and social policies. “It’s quite disturbing to see that economic and social policies conducted by the former regime remain largely unquestioned and that the EU seems to think past support programmes remain valid today and need little or no revision,” says EMHRN Executive Director Marc Schade-Poulsen. The recommendations attached to the report stress the need to tackle issues such as: the fight against corruption, promotion of social dialogue, reforming the educational system, diminishing inequalities between the regions, promoting women’s participation in the work force, promoting environmental protection, and revising economic relations between Tunisia and the EU including current management of migratory flows. The report which is written to foster debate within Tunisian society is the outcome of the EMHRN’s Solidarity Group for Tunisia set up in 2009. Information (gathered before and after the revolution, until late March 2011) has been compiled by a team of experts, including French CNRS Director Béatrice Hibou (author of The Force of Obedience. Political Economy of Repression in Tunisia, Cambridge, Polity Press, 2011), Meddeb Hamza (Policy researcher, CERI), and research student Mohamed Hamdi.
