Arabic EuroMed Rights strongly condemns the adoption on 11 July 2016 of the so-called ‘NGO Transparency Law’ by the Israeli Parliament. The Law will require Israeli nongovernmental organisations that receive more than 50% of their funding from foreign public sources to report them, and indicate on all publications that they are funded by foreign agents. Failing to abide by these rules will be considered a criminal offence subjecting the organisation to a fine. As outlined in previous EuroMed Rights statements, the Law disproportionately affects human rights NGOs who conduct crucial monitoring and reporting activities, at a time when human rights defenders are facing unprecedented levels of hostility and smear campaigns in Israel. This Law aims at stigmatising critical voices and limiting the right to freedom of expression which is a fundamental element to a vibrant democratic society. Common values, including freedom of expression and freedom of assembly, are an integral part of EU-Israel relations. As the EU moves to renegotiate its bilateral relations with Israel, the EU and its Member States must ensure that a commitment to human rights and democracy remains a key priority in their relations with Israel.
