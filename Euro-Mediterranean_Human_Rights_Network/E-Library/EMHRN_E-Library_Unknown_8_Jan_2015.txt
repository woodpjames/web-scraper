Arabic The Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Network (EMHRN) is appalled by the criminal attack on the French weekly satirical magazine ‘Charlie Hebdo,’ which left 12 journalists, cartoonists, policemen and staff members dead and four critically injured. “This attack on freedom of opinion and expression is not only an assault on universally recognised values, but also on the ‘live together’ in Europe, and between the North and South of the Mediterranean.’’ Said Michel Tubiana, EMHRN President. “The only way to overcome these tensions is to fight together for our freedoms and human rights, and tirelessly support those risking their lives upholding our shared values.”
