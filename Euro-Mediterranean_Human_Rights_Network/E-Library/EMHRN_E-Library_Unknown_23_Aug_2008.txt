Arabic The Gender Mainstreaming Reference Toolkit is intended to serve as a resource document for assisting the EMHRN and its member organisations, as well as generalist human rights organisations, women’s rights organisations and other civil society groups, in mainstreaming gender in their policies, programmes and interventions. As such, it is a both a knowledge and a practical tool. The toolkit was presented and discussed during the first EMHRN Women’s Rights and Gender WG meeting in April 2007 in Morocco. The current version includes the recommendations and reviews suggested by the Working Group as well as the feedback and comments provided during the subsequent testing of the GMRK in Beirut in May 2007 as well as the testing in Paris in November 2007.
