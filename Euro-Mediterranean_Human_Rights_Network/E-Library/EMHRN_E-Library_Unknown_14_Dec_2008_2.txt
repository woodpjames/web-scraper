French This document provides presents the Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Network’s (EMHRN) work program for 2008 to 2010. It is based on the EMHRN Strategy document (2006-2010) adopted at the 7th general assembly in Madrid 2006 and follows-up on the Work program for 2006-2008 adopted at the same occasion. These documents were built on an analysis of the human rights situation in the region and of the development of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership (EMP), the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) and the EU in terms of human rights. They were also built on a presentation of the EMRHN itself identifying its core vision, mission and values. The present document starts with a summary of the Strategy and past Work program. It thereafter proceeds with a presentation of how the EMHRN intends to adjust its work in the light of 2006 and 2007 developments. Then the different elements of the work program are presented.
