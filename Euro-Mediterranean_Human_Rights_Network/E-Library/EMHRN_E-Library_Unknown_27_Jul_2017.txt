French EuroMed Rights welcomes the adoption Wednesday by the Tunisian Assembly of the people’s representatives of the comprehensive law on fighting violence against women. Following many years of efforts, its adoption, which includes the main recommendations by civil society, is a milestone for women’s rights in Tunisia and the implementation of the principles defended by the new Constitution. This adoption represents the beginning of the important works of necessary reforms to the compliance of several legislative texts, such as the personal statute Code, the Tunisian Constitution and the related international dispositions, which are a major step in the fight against all forms of violence against women.
