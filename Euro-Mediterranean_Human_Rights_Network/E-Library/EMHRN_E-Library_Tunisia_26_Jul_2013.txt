Arabic The Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Network (EMHRN) strongly condemns the assassination of Tunisian opposition leader Mohammed Brahmi and extends its deepest condolences and sympathy to his family, his loved ones and to all democrats in Tunisia. This tragedy has come about as a result of what seems to be a government-sanctioned climate of intimidation and violence against the democratic movement in Tunisia. The EMHRN regrets that, more than five months after the tragic event of Chokri Belaid’s assassination, his murderers remain at large and unchallenged by the Tunisian Justice system. The repeated attacks, coming from government officials as well as from some ruling party leaders, extremist groups but also from groups claiming to safeguard the Tunisian revolution gave way to a series of violent acts and political murders that have first targeted Lotfi Nagdh, Chokri Belaid and today Mohamed Brahmi. A biased use of the justice system and law enforcement only serves to endorse a process which is seeing a single party seizing the main levers of state power. The EMHRN is calling on the Tunisian authorities to immediately carry out independent and impartial investigations so as to shed light on these violent episodes and so as to bring those guilty of such abominable acts swiftly to book. The EMHRN also asks that the Tunisian authorities enforce a ‘zero tolerance’ policy against this climate of intimidation and violence they have allowed to evolve. Public authorities in Tunisia are finally reminded they must ensure the safety and security of every person or institution under threat or attack. Finally, the EMHRN condemns the unjustified use of force by the police against peaceful demonstrators who gathered last night,July 25, at Habib Bourguiba avenue and calls, on the occasion of the general strike scheduled on 26 July by the UGTT and other relevant events, the Tunisian authorities to ensure the safety of every citizen against aggression and arbitrary use of force.
