French EuroMed Rights takes note on the decision by EU Member States to mandate the European Commission to renegotiate the EU-Morocco Fisheries partnership agreement, which expires in July 2018, without waiting for the decision of the European Court of Justice, planned on 27 February, on the validity of the current agreement because it applies to Western Sahara and its adjacent waters. EuroMed Rights reminds that commercial agreements between the EU and Morocco must be in compliance with international law and the decisions taken by the European Court of Justice, in the past as well as upcoming.
