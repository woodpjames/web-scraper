In Europe, as in countries both South and East of the Mediterranean, from Morocco to Turkey, citizens have taken to the streets to protest against policies they deemed unfair, to celebrate change or to topple dictatorships. This publication is the first part of a Regional Study on Freedom of Assembly in the Euro‑Mediterranean Region. It specifically deals with the legislative framework that enshrines the right to assembly in different countries. A second part which will be published during 2014, will deal with the implementation of legal provisions and the exercise of freedom of assembly in practice.
