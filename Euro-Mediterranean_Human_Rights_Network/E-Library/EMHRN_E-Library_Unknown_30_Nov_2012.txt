Arabic Whether you are a journalist, editor or blogger, you play a pivotal role in the world. Specifically, in media coverage of governments, constitutions, violations and elections, you can influence the public’s perception of women’s significance in shaping reforms in society, women’s status as credible leaders and experts in their fields, and women as sources for reliable information and thoughtful opinion. The EMHRN guide offers ideas for new angles for your media coverage of transition issues and suggestions for how to broaden your contacts lists. For each topic – violations, governments, elections and constitutions – we pose questions followed by a check-list for you to test your story against, to see whether you have included women. Each check-list is preceded by suggestions for news features, TV or radio discussion programmes and blogs. To make it easy for you to find information, we have provided annotated resources and links. One of the links is to the EMHRN website, https://www.euromedrights.org/, where you can find examples of the challenges women face in the transitions in Egypt, Tunisia, Libya and Syria.
