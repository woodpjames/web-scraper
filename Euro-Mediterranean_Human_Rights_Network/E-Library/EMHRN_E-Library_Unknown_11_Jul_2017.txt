Activity Report 2016

Activity Report,
Core Document July 11, 2017 On the Northern shores of the Mediterranean, the year 2016 was synonymous with a disintegration of the European Union, which was plagued by internal conflicts and lost its bearings as leading by example as a human rights promoter. This became apparent in what was falsely labelled a “refugee crisis”. In 2016, EuroMed Rights upped its work with members and partners, and continued to work both on thematic and country axes throughout the reporting year. In addition to our thematic work, our specific country programmes cover Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT), Egypt, Tunisia, Algeria and Syria, but we’ve also worked on Morocco, Turkey and Libya.
