Arabic The Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Network (EMHRN) strongly condemns the two terrorist attacks on an event on freedom of speech and a synagogue in Copenhagen last weekend, resulting in the death of two civilians and the injury of five policemen. “Targeting freedom of expression and a place of Jewish worship tragically recalls the attacks in Paris. Both incidents share the same narrative; aversion to free thought and anti-Semitism,” said Michel Tubiana, EMHRN President. “It’s together that we must respond to such acts, with respect for the rule of law and without stigmatisation.” Our thoughts go out to the families of the victims.
