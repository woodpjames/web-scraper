Arabic This 9 and 10 April 2016, French Prime Minister Manuel Valls will be visiting Algeria in order to participate to the third “High Level Interministerial Committee” between Algeria and France. The aim of the meeting is to boost the partnership between the two countries and it should also examine the cooperation on counter-terrorism and “security in the region”, with the Malian and the Libyan cases. If security issues are important, there can be no compromise with human rights. On the contrary, the most effective and sustainable solutions/policies are those firmly based on the rule of law and grounded in respect for human rights. Therefore, on the occasion of his visit, EuroMed Rights and its members, have sent a letter to Prime Minister Manuel Valls in which we call to make sure that the issue of human rights and fundamental freedoms, including freedom of association, is at the heart of the agenda with his Algerian counterparts.
