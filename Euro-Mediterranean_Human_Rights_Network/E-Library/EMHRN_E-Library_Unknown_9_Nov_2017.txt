Turkey November 09, 2017 Today in Ankara the President of Human Rights Association (IHD), Mr Ozturk Turkdogan, was arrested by police forces together with two more executive committee members, Ms Sevim Salihoglu and Ms Derya Uysal, and one staff member, Ms Besra Varli. They were protesting against the human rights situation in Ankara and in particular against the blockade of human rights statue in the Capital of Turkey. Though Mr Turkdogan has been released, EuroMed Rights strongly condemns the arbitrary nature of the arrest and asksÂ the Turkish authorities to immediately and unconditionally release the other activists. Their detention only aims at sanctioning his legitimate human rights activities. EuroMed Rights also asks Turkey to ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by Turkey. Human Rights Association (IHD) is a Member of EuroMed Rights since 1997.
