Arabic After having examined the situation of human rights in Western Sahara, EuroMed Rights has decided to carry out a similar study of the Sahrawi refugee camps in Algeria. To this end, a mission had firstly been planned from 6-12 march 2016. Due to delays in delivering the visas, the visit could not take place. A second attempt at organising the mission was thus contemplated between 7-14 may 2016.  The mission did not take place because two members of the visiting delegation failed to get their visas. EuroMed Rights regrets this situation and hopes it is only temporary. Keen to conduct similar investigations to those organised in Western Sahara, EuroMed Rights wishes the delegation will eventually be granted the necessary visas and authorisations so as to get access to the Sahrawi refugee camps in October 2016.
