Trial Monitoring June 15, 2015 Between 6 April 2014 and 23 February 2015, EuroMed Rights commissioned observers from the Solicitors’ International Human Rights Group (SIHRG) to monitor hearings held in a criminal case brought by the General-Prosecutor of Egypt against Alaa Abd El-Fattah (known to be an activist supporting reform and democracy) and 22 other persons. This report focused on the trial of Alaa Abd El-Fattah and answers the question “Was the trial fair?” Arising from a protest that took place outside the Shura Council in Cairo on the 26 November 2013, Alaa Abd El-Fattah, was charged under Egypt’s  Law 107 of 2013 on the Right to Public Meetings, Processions and Peaceful Demonstrations (commonly referred to as the “Protest Law” or “Demonstration Law”) with organising a protest without prior notification. Alaa was also charged under the 1914 Assembly Law with organising and participating in a “crowd of more than five people” and related disruption and assaults. Additionally, under the general Criminal Code, he was charged with the assault of two police officers and the theft of a police officer’s radio. On 23 February 2015, the Court found Alaa Abd El-Fattah guilty of the offences aforementioned except the theft of the radio. He was sentenced to five years in prison, a fine of 100,000 Egyptian pounds (about 11,700 euros) and supervision for a period of five years after his release. This report concludes that Alaa Abd El-Fattah’s right to a fair trial was not observed by the Court. Read the full report here
