Arabic  January 25th marks the fifth anniversary of the Egyptian revolution, which overthrew former President Mubarak to instore democracy and social justice. However, despite hope and aspirations for democracy, Egyptian Human Rights activists are being increasingly targeted, threatened, prosecuted in political trials and sentenced to long prison terms due to their prominent contribution in initiating change. EuroMed Rights, along with other organisations, is initiating a petition calling upon the European Foreign Affairs Ministers to pressure the Egypt’s President for an immediate release of all Human Rights activists. This petition is part of a wider campaign, Human Rights Behind Bars in Egypt, which focuses on specific cases of activists wrongly imprisoned. In Egyptian President Sisi’s own words “(…) there are many innocent people inside prisons, soon many of them will be released according to the available permissions”, yet many Human Rights activists are still in jail without due process. Ahead of the Foreign Affairs Council of the European Union on 14 March 2016, EuroMed Rights and its partner organisations is calling upon the public to sign the petition, asking their Foreign Affairs Minister to raise this systematic crackdown on dissent with Egypt’s President. Every voice counts! Help us in getting as many as possible and spreading the word to #DetainNoMore Human Rights Activists in Egypt!
