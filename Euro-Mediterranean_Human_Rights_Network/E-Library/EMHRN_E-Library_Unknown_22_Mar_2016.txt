French Brussels/Copenhagen/Paris/Tunis, 22 March 2016 EuroMed Rights strongly condemns the attacks perpetrated on Tuesday 22 March in Brussels. Four months after the Paris attacks, it is the heart of Europe that has been hit and with this, all Europeans. We condemn the cowardice of these barbaric acts aimed at civilians taking public transport and call upon everyone not to fall into hate and violence. In these tragic hours, we must not amalgamate and we must instead show unity, solidarity and the scrupulous respect of the Rule of Law. « These attacks aim to divide the European society and destroy our universal values. It is imperative we remain united in the face of terrorism! », has declared Michel Tubiana, President of EuroMed Rights. « We present our most sincere condoleances to the families of the victims of these attacks, as well as the many people injured by this morning’s explosions. These new innomable attacks do not discourage us from pursuing our fight to defend Human Rights and liberties, in Europe and in the Euro-Mediterranean region.»
