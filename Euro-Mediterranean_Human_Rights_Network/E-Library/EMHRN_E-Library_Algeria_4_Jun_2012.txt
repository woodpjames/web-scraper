Arabic The EMHRN General Assembly strongly condemns the violations of labor rights and human rights in Algeria. Its members express their solidarity with the nine Union leaders of the National Federation of Justice Employees, affiliated to SNAPAP (National Independent Union of Public Administration Personnel), who have been leading a hunger strike for 28 days as a result of the refusal to recognise their trade union and urge the Algerian authorities to comply urgently with the law.
