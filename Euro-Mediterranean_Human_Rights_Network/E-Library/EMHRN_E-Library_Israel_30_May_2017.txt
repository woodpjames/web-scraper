French The 5th of June 2017 marks 50 years since the beginning of Israel’s occupation of the Palestinian Territory. Israelis and Palestinians now live a reality where, under a single regime, one group is privileged while the other is deprived of its basic human rights. For 50 years, Israel has administered a pervasive system of control over Palestinians in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT), while denying them their right to self-determination and controlling virtually all aspects of their lives without giving them any say. The European Union (EU) has a crucial and urgent role to play to counter these developments and help put an end to the occupation. Read our 4-pager on the 50 years of occupation.
