Shrinking Space for Civil Society December 11, 2018 EuroMed Rights expresses grave concern about the situation of writer and political activist Ibrahim al-Husseini, who is in incommunicado detention after being arrested and initially disappeared on Sunday 9 December. During his interrogation he was blindfolded for more than 12 hours and denied access to a lawyer. Security forces then took al-Husseini to the Shubra al-Kheima police station before transferring him to a second unknown location. His relatives were not allowed to provide him with food, warm clothes or medicine, even though he suffers from diabetes, high blood pressure and blood clotting. EuroMed Rights strongly condemns Husseini’s arrest and initial disappearance, both likely to be linked to his social media activity. EuroMed Rights denounces the intensification of the repression against human rights defenders, activists, journalists, writers, political activists and lawyers over the last months in Egypt. We also denounce Husseini’s conditions of interrogation.
