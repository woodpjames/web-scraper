French Brussels, 3 août 2017 – EuroMed Rights, the Belgian Human Rights League, the ADDE, the CIRÉ, the CNCD 11.11.11, Amnesty International Belgium and the European Association for the defence of human rights (AEDH) hereby condemn the updating of the list of countries of origin deemed “safe” by the Belgian government. We oppose the very notion of safety being used as a means to examine asylum claims for it substantially weakens procedural safeguards which may have serious consequences on the fundamental rights of asylum seekers. Such measures result in the introduction of specific procedures and, eventually, in asylum claims being assessed differently. This may potentially impact the rights of asylum seekers who may be discriminated against because of their nationality, which cannot be tolerated. In particular, we firmly denounce: Our organisations recall that the right of asylum should be safeguarded and guaranteed for all in full respect of the 1951 Geneva Convention. We therefore consider that the very existence of a list of so-called “safe” countries of origin is a major threat to human rights. In the context of increased polarisation and tensions on migration issues at policy level, we express our opposition to the “safe” country of origin concept, to the establishment of a list on this very basis, and to the enlisting of Maghreb countries.
