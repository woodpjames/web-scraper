French The purpose of the present report is to describe the activities of the EMHRN that has been carried out within this framework. As such the report provides a detailed overview of EMHRN activities and should be read as background information to the conclusions of the enclosed progress report and to the separate financial report. The report is built-up according to the Action Plan, the progress report and the financial narrative and narrates regional initiatives, thematic initiatives, and actions regarding countries. The report of activities does not confine itself to the description of one year’s activities. This is due to the fact that it has not been possible for the EMHRN to hold an annual General Assembly.
