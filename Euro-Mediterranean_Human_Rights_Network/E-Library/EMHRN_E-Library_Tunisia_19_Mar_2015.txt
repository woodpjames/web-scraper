Arabic The Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Network (EMHRN) strongly condemns the attack perpetrated at the Bardo Museum in Tunis on Wednesday 18 March 2015. Whoever the authors may have been, the sole purpose of such an act of violence was to destabilize a country which has chosen the path of democracy. The EMHRN wishes to assure Tunisia and the families of the victims and their relatives of its solidarity. It shares their desire to see Tunisia remain unyielding in the face of such senseless violence, and will do all it can to support the Tunisian people’s wish for democracy and justice. The desire to support Tunisian democracy must also be at the heart of the European Union’s and its Member States’ concerns. The EU must support Tunisia through practical measures that respect the Tunisian people’s desire for freedom and dignity. Support must go beyond the fight against terrorism, which could lead to excess spending on security, and must embrace all areas, including economic and social rights. In conjunction with its members and a strong, renewed and diverse Tunisian civil society, the EMHRN is calling on all stakeholders – the EU first and foremost among them – to strengthen their support. The future of Tunisia, the future of democracy in the southern Mediterranean and therefore the future of Europe itself are at stake.
