Shrinking Space for Civil Society November 04, 2016 Prominent Egyptian human rights lawyer and director of the Lawyers Network of the Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR), Malek Adly, has been banned from travelling by Cairo airport security this Wednesday 2nd November.  Malek Adly, who had already been arrested in May 2016 and spent close to four months in prison, is harassed by Egyptian authorities and like many other human rights defenders, he is also prevented from travelling abroad.  This systematic crackdown by the Egyptian government is very worrying and may bring about the complete eradication of the human rights community in Egypt.  The travel ban against Malek Adly and all other human rights defenders in a similar situation should be lifted. Independent civil society in Egypt should be allowed to continue to work unimpeded.
