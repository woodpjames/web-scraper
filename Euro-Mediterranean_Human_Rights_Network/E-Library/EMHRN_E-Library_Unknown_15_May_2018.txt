Shrinking Space for Civil Society May 15, 2018 EuroMed Rights strongly condemns the detention since yesterday of General Director of the Palestinian Human Rights Organisation (PHRO), Ghassan Abdallah, by the Lebanese General Security Office. As the basis of his detention is not clear, we demand first of all to know as soon as possible what it consists in. EuroMed Rights is deeply concerned about Ghassan Abdallah’s interrogation, considering he had been threatened with torture during his detention in 2010. Another cause of concern is his current fragile health condition, which requires permanent access to medication. We call on the EU to urgently raise this case with the Lebanese authorities to ensure that Ghassan Abdallah’s fundamental rights are protected, free from police or judicial harassment and intimidation.  Note to Editors:
PHRO is an independent Human Rights NGO that works to promote, protect and defend the rights of the Palestinian refugees in Lebanon. Since 2001, PHRO has been an engaged member organisation of EuroMed Rights.
