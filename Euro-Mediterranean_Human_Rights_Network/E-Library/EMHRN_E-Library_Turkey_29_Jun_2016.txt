Arabic Brussels/Copenhagen/Paris/Tunis, 29 June 2016 EuroMed Rights strongly condemns the attacks perpetrated on Tuesday 28 June at the Atatürk International airport in Turkey. Less than a year after the Paris, Brussels, and Qaa (Lebanon) attacks, it is a crossroad city between the East and the West that has been struck. We strongly condemn these barbaric and coward acts of violence against civilians. “This attack is the last example of violation of right to life. Our region has experienced similar attacks recently in Lebanon, Belgium, France etc. All these attacks directly target right to life that is the basis of human rights. Those who are responsible for this brutality must be brought to justice” declared Osman İşçi, Executive Committee Member of EuroMed Rights and board member of the Human Rights Association (İHD). EuroMed Rights presents its most sincere condolences to the families of the victims of these attacks, as well as the many people injured in yesterday’s explosions. These attacks won’t discourage us from pursuing our struggle for human rights and liberties, in Europe and in the Euro-Mediterranean region.
