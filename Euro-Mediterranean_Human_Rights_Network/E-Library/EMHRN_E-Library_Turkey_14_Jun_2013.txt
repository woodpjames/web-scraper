Turkey June 14, 2013 While the police continued to violently crackdown on peaceful demonstrations on Taksim Square and in Gezi Park, a fourth person died in the protests and over 50 lawyers have been arrested while protesting in an Istanbul courthouse. In addition, Turkish citizens, human rights defenders, trade unions and civil society organisations continue to be under attack by the Turkish government. Yesterday, the European Parliament discussed the current situation in Turkey in the plenary debate in Strasbourg and formulated the following demands to end the violence, including: SOLIDAR, İnsan Hakları Derneği (İHD), Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Network and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) welcome these demands as they coincide with the joint draft resolution issued last week, supported by the EPAN working group of CONCORD and DVV International. In light of these resolutions, we urge the European Commission and the European External Action Service (EEAS) to engage in close dialogue with Turkey on crucial issues such as the judiciary and fundamental rights, especially through chapters 23 (Judiciary and Fundamental Rights) and 24 (Justice, Freedom and Security) as part of the Accession Partnership as they provide an important policy tool to put pressure on the Turkish government to ensure that all national legislation related to human rights and fundamental freedoms is in line with the essential values of the EU and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR).
