<blockquote>We know … that we are clandestine migrants, illegal

migrants. We know we don’t have [some] rights. But we know we have human

rights. Human beings need to be respected. We can’t be mistreated.

<span>– André

P., 27, Guinea</span>
</blockquote>
<p>André P. is one of hundreds of sub-Saharan African migrants

who live at any given moment in makeshift camps in the forests of Morocco. Like

many of his fellow migrants, André, who traveled by foot and car over

hundreds of miles from his home in Guinea, considers Morocco simply a way

station on his journey to Europe. Sub-Saharan African migrants leave their

countries for a variety of reasons: poverty, family and social problems,

political upheaval and civil conflict, and fear of persecution—but they

uniformly describe their goal as reaching Europe to create a better life.</p>
<p>
      <span>Many

migrants stay in campsites around cities near Morocco’s borders with

Algeria and Spain’s north African enclave of Melilla. The migrants lack

basic necessities living outdoors where they sleep in homemade tents and are

exposed to cold and rain. Migrants with disabilities face even greater hurdles

in accessing food, water, and toilets. Many migrants, having saved up their

meager resources to escape poverty, persecution, or hopelessness, find

themselves vulnerable to abuse rather than finding safety upon arriving in

Morocco.</span>
    </p>
<p>
      <span>Human Rights Watch has

documented cases where Moroccan police beat these migrants, deprived them of

their few possessions, burned their shelters, and expelled them from the

country without due process. Morocco’s government insists that the police

were enforcing national immigration policy and denied that the police

perpetrated violence against migrants. However, statements from the migrants,

corroborated by other sources, suggested many cases of abuse of sub-Saharan

Africans in Morocco. This report focuses

on the treatment of sub-Saharan African migrants currently in Morocco’s

northeastern region, between the Algerian border and the Spanish enclave of

Melilla. Human Rights Watch interviewed 67

sub-Saharan African migrants living in unofficial campsites in this region

around the cities of Oujda and Nador in December 2012, and another two

sub-Saharan African migrants in Melilla. </span>
    </p>
<p>
      <span>Forty-two of the 67 migrants

interviewed by Human Rights Watch in December 2012 described what they said

were frequent police raids. Some of them said that during the raids the police

arrested male migrants without charge, destroyed migrant shelters and personal

property, and sometimes stole migrants’ valuables. </span>
    </p>
<p>
      <span>Thirty-seven of the 67

migrants interviewed by Human Rights Watch said that Moroccan security

officials also forcibly expelled them at the Moroccan-Algerian border without

taking the appropriate legal measures, which require the police to assess

whether the migrants had proper documentation, such as visas that would enable

them to be in Morocco for three months; were seeking asylum to escape

persecution; or were refugees with permission to remain in Morocco. Security

forces also denied the migrants basic procedural rights under international law,

including the right to consult a lawyer, the right to be notified of their

impending expulsion, the right to appeal such an order, and the right to be

assisted by an interpreter, if necessary. The security forces committed these

abuses against regular migrants, as well as members of groups entitled to

special protection under national and international law, such as children, pregnant

women, asylum seekers, and recognized refugees.</span>
    </p>
<p>
      <span>In the 1990s, Morocco became

increasingly popular as a transit country for sub-Saharan Africans. The Moroccan government has coordinated security measures

and border management with European Union (EU) member states, especially Spain,

since the 1990s, and the country has become an important partner in EU efforts to curb

the number of migrants reaching European shores as part of what has been

described as the “externalization” of EU migration policy. EU

states have a particular interest in protecting entry into the Spanish

enclaves, Melilla and Ceuta, as parts of the EU that are on the southern side

of the Mediterranean Sea. Some argue that the introduction of Morocco’s

2003 law on immigration (Law 02-03) was a response to EU pressures for stronger

migration controls in Morocco. </span>
    </p>
<p>
      <span>Morocco and Spain’s

coordinated efforts have at times resulted in violence against migrants and

expulsions from the Spanish enclaves to Morocco. Reports from nonprofit

organizations and the media indicate that since December 2011, the Moroccan

authorities have tightened pressure on sub-Saharan migrants, raiding areas

where they are known to live, arresting migrants suspected of being

undocumented, and conducting collective expulsions of migrants at the border

with Algeria.</span>
    </p>
<p>
      <span>Most migrants enter Morocco either

via Mauritania or by transiting through Niger and then Algeria. They largely choose to settle in Morocco, at least

temporarily, because of its proximity to Europe. Via the Algerian town of Maghnia, many migrants who enter Morocco first

reach the city of Oujda on the other side of the border. They then often try to

make their way to Nador, a coastal city that is located 15 kilometers from the

Spanish enclave of Melilla. Moroccan and Spanish border patrols monitor the

perimeters of Melilla and Spain’s other enclave on the southern

Mediterranean coast, Ceuta, to prevent the migration of undocumented migrants. </span>
    </p>
<p>
      <span>The number of irregular migrants

currently in Morocco is not known with

certainty, but estimates range from 4,500 to 40,000. On November

11, 2013, the Ministries of Interior and Migration Affairs jointly announced a

one-time program to regularize six categories of migrants during 2014, at which

time they estimated the population of irregular migrants to be between 25,000

and 40,000. Previously, the Moroccan

Ministry of the Interior had estimated the number of undocumented migrants to

be between 10,000 and 15,000 as of 2012. Others have considerably lower

estimates; <i>Médecins Sans Frontières</i> (MSF) determined in a

2010 survey that there were approximately 4,500 undocumented migrants in

Morocco. According to 2013 MSF figures,

there are between 500 and 1,000 migrants in Oujda and between 500 and 1,000

migrants in Nador. </span>
    </p>
<p><span>To cross from Nador to

Melilla, migrants who lack legal authorization to enter the Schengen Area (an

area comprising 26 European countries with no internal border controls) must

overcome three tall razor-wire fences separating Morocco and Spain or they

might take an inflatable raft or boat from Moroccan waters to Melilla or across

the Mediterranean. (Although Melilla and Ceuta are part of the Schengen Area,

as they are Spanish territories, additional border checks still take place for

any further sea or air travel to mainland Spain or other European destinations.)

</span>However, this does not deter migrants from attempting to reach the

enclaves because they hope they might be transferred to mainland Spain once

inside the enclaves. </p>
<p>
      <span>Human Rights Watch interviews

suggest that both Moroccan Auxiliary Forces and the Spanish <i>Guardia Civil</i>

have used excessive force against migrants trying to enter Melilla. The <i>Guardia

Civil</i> summarily removed migrants who entered Melilla and handed them over

to Moroccan border patrols at the Melilla-Morocco border, at which point the

Moroccan authorities beat the border crossers, including children. Migrants who

were expelled from Morocco to Algeria reported similar abuse at the hands of

Moroccan and Algerian authorities, who, the migrants said, used force—or

the threat of force—at the border. </span>
    </p>
<p>For example, Frank D., who was 17

years old at the time of the interview, left Cameroon after his parents died to

find a way to sustain himself. After a six-month journey traveling through

Niger and Algeria, he reached Morocco. He tried to climb the fence around

Melilla but cut himself on the razor-wire and fell back onto the Moroccan side.

Moroccan border guards arrested him. Frank said that the guards beat and

injured him with wooden batons, even though the fall had stunned him and he was

not resisting or trying to escape. The police took him to the hospital, where

he remained for two days under medical care. He was then released on crutches,

put on a bus, and taken to Oujda to be expelled across the Morocco-Algeria

border. Frank said he was not allowed to see a lawyer, use the services of an

interpreter, gain information regarding the deportation decision against him,

or appeal the decision. The authorities also disregarded the special rights and

protections that attach to unaccompanied migrant children: they conducted

neither an age determination nor family tracing for Frank nor assigned a

guardian to represent his interests. Frank, in other words, was expelled in

contravention of his right to due process, along with other violations of his

basic rights. </p>
<p><span>While Morocco has the right

to police its borders and enforce a legal regime for the processing of

migrants, it must not engage in cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment of

migrants, beating them, robbing them of their possessions, and summarily

destroying their makeshift shelters. Morocco also does not have the right to

expel migrants without due process. </span>In addition, Morocco owes a special

duty of care to unaccompanied migrant children, ensuring that these children

are protected from abuse and exploitation.<span> Human Rights Watch finds the violence endured by some migrants

at their informal settlements, and as they attempt to travel to Spain, amounts

to excessive use of force that at times rose to the level of inhuman or

degrading treatment, in violation of human rights law.</span></p>
<p>In September 2013, the Moroccan government announced it

would implement a new migration and asylum policy, based on a set of

recommendations formulated by the National Human Rights Council (CNDH) in

September 2013 and endorsed by King Mohammed VI. The CNDH report highlighted

human rights abuses against migrants, asylum seekers, and refugees in Morocco.

While noting that the authorities have the right to control the entrance and

the stay of foreigners; to protect the security of the national territory; and

to fight against smuggling of migrants, trafficking in persons, and organized

crime; the CNDH also called on the government to respect Morocco’s

constitution and international commitments regarding the rights of refugees and

asylum seekers, migrants, and victims of human trafficking. Despite Moroccan

authorities’ political commitments to a new migration and asylum policy, it

was too early to assess how fully the government has implemented the CNDH’s

recommendations at the time of the publication of this report. </p>
<p>
      <span>Human Rights Watch calls

on the Moroccan government to remedy the violations delineated in this report

as part of its new migration policy. The government should end the use of excessive force

against migrants, stop the forced returns and expulsions of migrants without

due process, and respect the rights of refugees and asylum seekers who wish to

lodge a refugee claim.

Morocco should, as party to the

Convention on the Rights of the Child, respond appropriately to unaccompanied

children who enter Morocco by ensuring that the best interest of the child is considered and that

procedural safeguards are in place to guarantee that age determination

procedures and family tracing occurs, as well as providing </span>
      <span>guardians, legal assistance, and social assistance

to unaccompanied

migrant children. </span>
    </p>
<p>
      <span>Human Rights Watch also calls

upon the Algerian government to stop its border security forces from violently

and summarily pushing back migrants expelled by Morocco at the border. </span>
    </p>
<p>
      <span>Human Rights Watch urges the

Spanish government to ensure that migrants are not arbitrarily removed,

including at the border. In addition, Human Rights Watch asks the European

Commission to investigate and monitor Morocco’s treatment of migrants who

are attempting to cross Morocco into EU territory and ensure that any

cooperation between the EU and its member states, and Morocco is in accordance

with EU and international human rights standards. Human Rights Watch further

calls on the EU and its member states to provide support to develop

Morocco’s ability to fairly consider asylum claims and to implement the

integration strategy planned for refugees and migrants who will benefit from

the announced regularization procedure to the extent that it is respectful of

their human rights. </span>

</h1>
<p>This report is based on research in Morocco and Spain from

late November 2012 to mid-December 2012. Human Rights Watch researchers

interviewed 66 migrants in the cities of Nador and Oujda in Morocco and 4

migrants in the Spanish enclave of Melilla. Two of the migrants in Melilla were

Moroccan unaccompanied migrant children and one migrant was from Bangladesh.

They were not included in the total of 67 migrants from sub-Saharan Africa

referenced throughout the report.</p>
<p>
      <span>Out of the 67 sub-Saharan

migrants interviewed in Morocco and Spain, 37, including 4 women, had been

expelled by Moroccan authorities at the border with Algeria and had returned to Morocco.

Thirteen, including 5 children, had been expelled from Melilla.</span>
    </p>
<p>Human Rights Watch interviewed 10 unaccompanied children,

the youngest of whom was 12 years old<span>. The oldest

person interviewed was 52 years old. Two migrants were identified as having

physical disabilities. Human Rights Watch interviewed 25 migrants who

identified themselves as coming from Cameroon, 14 from Ghana, 7 from Nigeria, 7

from Guinea, 5 from Mali, 4 from the Democratic Republic of Congo, 2 each from

Côte d’Ivoire and Morocco, and 1 each from Bangladesh, Benin,

Senegal and Burkina Faso. Human Rights Watch interviewed 21 women and 49 men. </span></p>

      <span>The names of all migrants and

asylum seekers interviewed for this report have been changed in the interest of

their security.</span>

      <b>

      </b>
    </p>
<p>
      <span>All

interviewees were informed of the purpose of the interview and that their

interviews might be used publicly. No incentives were offered or provided to

persons interviewed. All interviews were conducted individually or, when

conditions allowed no alternative, in a small group. Most interviews were

conducted in private

locations. The

interviews were conducted in French, Arabic, or English. </span>

    </p>
<p>
      <span>Local activists and nongovernmental organizations

(NGOs) that regularly work in the sites we visited helped Human Rights Watch to identify interviewees. We asked the governor of Melilla and the facility

director for permission to visit<i> Los Centros de Estancia Temporal de

Inmigrantes</i> (CETI – Centers for the Temporary Stay of Immigrants) in

Melilla, but received no response to our request.</span>

<p>
      <span>Human

Rights Watch interviewed, either in person or by telephone, officials of the United Nations High Commissioner

for Refugees (UNHCR), the Delegation of the European Union in Morocco, and the

International Organization for Migration (IOM) in Rabat, Morocco. We also interviewed

staff members of NGOs in Morocco and Spain, including Médecins Sans

Frontières Spain (MSF-Spain), the <i>Groupe antiraciste

d’accompagnement et de défense des étrangers et migrants</i>

(Gadem), the <i>Organisation Marocaine des droits de l’homme</i> (Moroccan

Organization for Human Rights, OMDH, Rabat

and Oujda sections), the <i>Association marocaine des droits humains</i> (the

Moroccan Association for Human Rights,

AMDH, Rabat and Oujda sections, <i>l'association Rif des droits de l'Homme </i>(the Rif Association for Human Rights), and the <i>Association

Beni Znassen pour la Culture, le Développement et la Solidarité</i>

(Beni Znassen Association for Culture, Development and Solidarity, ABCDS).

Human Rights Watch interviewed representatives of Morocco’s Interministerial Delegation of Human Rights and the <i>Conseil

national des droits de l’Homme </i>(National Human Rights Council, CNDH).<span></span></span>

<h2>
      <span></span>
      <span>
        <span>Terminology</span>
      </span>
    </h2>
<p>When describing law enforcement officials in Morocco,

migrants interviewed by Human Rights Watch did not distinguish clearly among Moroccan

military, police, and <i>gendarmes</i>, but their roles are indeed distinct.

Police officers operate in urban areas, while <i>gendarmes</i> operate in rural

ones. </p>
<p>
      <span>The Auxiliary Force is a

paramilitary force that, among other responsibilities, is tasked with assisting

other security forces when necessary and guarding Morocco’s borders in

the north of the country. In this report, when migrants encounter security

forces at the border with Algeria or Spain, they are usually encountering agents

of the Auxiliary Forces. Often, when migrants encounter Moroccan security and

law enforcement officials in urban areas or in informal migrant camps outside

cities, they are describing police and <i>gendarmes. </i>Interviews with

migrants indicate that Moroccan Auxiliary Forces provided additional support to

the police and <i>gendarmes</i> when conducting raids on makeshift migrant

camps outside of Nador and Oujda. According to migrant accounts, these three

forces coordinate their efforts at various stages. </span>
    </p>
<p>Both Auxiliary Forces and <i>gendarmes</i> usually take

migrants to police stations in the larger city centers (Nador and Oujda) before

expelling them. When migrants are expelled at the border with Algeria, they are

usually handed over by the police or <i>gendarmes</i> to the Auxiliary Forces near

the border. </p>
<p>Although international law defines “migrant

workers,” it does not define “migrants.” In this report,

“migrant” is a broad term to describe third-country nationals in

Morocco. We use the term inclusively rather than exclusively; the use of the

term “migrant” does not exclude the possibility that a person may

be an asylum seeker or refugee.</p>
<p>
      <span>An “asylum

seeker” is a person who is trying to be recognized as a refugee or to

establish a claim for protection on other grounds. Where we are confident that

a person is seeking protection, whether in Morocco or Europe, we refer to that

person as an asylum seeker. A “refugee,” as defined in the 1951

Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol, is a person with a

“well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion,

nationality, membership of a particular social group or political

opinion” who is outside his country of nationality and is unable or

unwilling, because of that fear, to return. The 1969 Organization of African

Unity Refugee Convention further defines refugees as persons who are compelled

to flee “events seriously disturbing public order.” Recognition of

refugee status by a government or UNHCR is declaratory, which means that people

are, in fact, refugees before they have been officially recognized as such. </span>
    </p>
<p>
      <span>In line with article 1 of

the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the term “child” refers

to a person under 18.</span>

      </a>
      <span> This report discusses children traveling with their families as well as

unaccompanied children. When referring both to children traveling with their

families and to unaccompanied children, the report uses the term “migrant

children.” This term includes children seeking asylum or those granted

UNHCR refugee certificates. The definition of “unaccompanied migrant

child” comes from the term “unaccompanied child” used by the

Committee on the Rights of the Child. According to the committee’s

General Comment No. 6, “‘Unaccompanied children’ are

children, as defined in article 1 of the Convention, who have been separated

from both parents and other relatives and are not being cared for by an adult

who, by law or custom, is responsible for doing so.”</span>

      <span>Most migrants interviewed by

Human Rights Watch in Morocco come from western and central African countries,

which they have left because of poverty, family and social problems, political

upheaval, civil strife, and, in some cases, fear of persecution. Interviews

Human Rights Watch conducted indicate that there are two main land routes of

migration into Morocco: one follows the West African coast via Mauritania; the

other one, more heavily used in recent years, is inland through Niger and

Algeria with an entry point to Morocco near the Algerian town of Maghnia.</span>

          </span>
        </span>
      </a>
      <span> Smuggling networks appear to play an important role

in organizing transit through Niger and Algeria into Morocco. Most migrants who

enter Morocco through Maghnia head toward Oujda, the closest city on the

Moroccan side,</span>
      <a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">
        <span class="MsoFootnoteReference">

      </a>
      <span> before heading to the areas surrounding Nador, if

their aim is to attempt to enter the Spanish enclave of Melilla or to attempt a

journey across the Mediterranean by boat.</span>
    </p>
<p>
      <span>In and

around Oujda, migrants live in several sites, including the “Fac”

site on the university campus in the city,<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6"><span>[6]</span></a>

and, outside the city, the “Café Gala” area, the

“Moussakine” forest, and the Sidi Maafa forest. Interviews with

migrants and with local NGOs indicated that most migrants who enter Morocco

from Algeria go to the Oujda Fac site to join other migrants and find smugglers

who can help them on the next step of their journey.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7"><span>[7]</span></a>

Some settle in more secluded sites, such as in the forested hills and mountains

outside of Oujda. While waiting to make the passage to Melilla, migrants stay

in several sites around Nador: Mount Gourougou, the mountain on the Moroccan

side of the border with Melilla; forest areas near Selouane, a neighboring

town; and forest areas near the <i>Marjane</i> supermarket outside of Nador. </span>
    </p>
<p><span>In all of these sites that

Human Rights Watch visited, migrants live in tents improvised from sticks, branches,

and plastic tarps. The makeshift shelters are often cramped, housing </span>several

families <span>or large groups of unrelated individuals.

      <span>Human Rights Watch interviews

depicted conditions where migrants subsist without running water or

electricity, or do not have sufficient protection from cold, rain, and wind. Far

from city centers and lacking transportation, the migrants have little access

to medical services when necessary, and they shy away from schools for fear of

being noticed and apprehended by the police.</span>
    </p>
<p>
      <span>Migrants have limited options

for earning money in Morocco. Many are undocumented, thus unable to work legally.

While some find work in larger cities, there are fewer opportunities in rural

areas. Most migrants interviewed by Human Rights Watch survive on the begging

that some of them carry out. Because law enforcement officials are more likely

to arrest male sub-Saharan migrants than females, according to those we

interviewed, women more often go to the <i>medina</i> (the old city)—with

children in tow—to beg for money and food, usually near mosques after

Friday prayers.</span>

<blockquote>It’s a very terrible life in the forest. I used to

sleep but now I wake up at 3 a.m. to go to the school [to hide] because [the

police] come and arrest us every day. They run after [us]. They burned our

</blockquote>
<p>
      <span>Police conduct frequent raids

on the makeshift migrant camps in the areas surrounding Nador and Oujda to

apprehend undocumented migrants, including unaccompanied children, and

subsequently expel them at the Algerian border. According to interviews with

migrants, the frequency of the raids varies from daily to weekly. Migrants,

anxious that the police will raid their camps, sleep very little from 4 a.m. to

6 a.m., when the police usually carry out their raids. “We don’t

sleep,” said Luc F., a 27-year-old from Cameroon. “The police can

come at any time. I run barefoot on the hill, we’re tracked like monkeys.

They come at 5:45 [a.m.], screaming. They try to rob, take everything.”</span>

    </p>
<p>
      <span>Of the 67 migrants Human

Rights Watch interviewed in sites around Nador and Oujda, 42 migrants described

frequent raids. Interviews with migrants at these various sites indicated a

pattern of abuse by law enforcement officials during their raids: robbing

migrants’ money and objects of value, such as phones; burning their

personal property and makeshift shelters; and using excessive force against

migrants when apprehending them. In some cases, officials destroyed or confiscated

passports and other documents without returning them. </span>
    </p>
<p>
      <span>Pierre C.

is a 28-year-old migrant from Ghana who said he had arrived alone in Morocco

eight months before being interviewed by Human Rights Watch in December 2012.

At that time, he was staying in the Moussakine forest outside of Oujda with

other Ghanaian men. He described living in constant fear of being arrested and

forced to return to the Algerian border:</span>
    </p>
<blockquote>There is no rest here. Every morning, the <i>gendarmes</i>

come. Yesterday [December 2, 2012], I was trying to prepare food and they came.

I asked them if they could wait until I ate a bit, knowing that I

wouldn’t have food, only a long walk after deportation [from the border

back to Oujda], but they refused. It was 6:30 a.m. and I walked with them and obeyed

because if you refuse, they will beat you up.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9"><span>[9]</span></a>
</blockquote>
<p>
      <span>After Pierre was arrested,

the <i>gendarmes</i> took him to the Oujda police station, where he was

fingerprinted and held in a cell with other migrants until 8 p.m. He said they

were then taken by bus to another police post near the border with Algeria and

handed over to Auxiliary Forces who walked him and other migrants close to the

border and forced them to leave Morocco. After he walked away from the Moroccan

authorities, he waited until he was out of their sight and started the six-hour

walk back to his campsite.</span>

      </a>
    </p>
<p>
      <span>Mahdi S., who lives in the

Sidi Maafa forest just on the outskirts of Oujda, described a similar situation:

“There is no work; it’s very hard to eat. I beg for money outside

the mosque. The police come every day so I sleep for a few hours then go back.

They burn our tents – like they are going to war.”<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11"><span>[11]</span></a></span>
    </p>
<p>
      <span>In Nador, the situation

mirrors the one in Oujda. Antonin S. told Human Rights Watch about the daily

morning raids he had encountered: “I have been in Nador since August

2012. I am choking with fear. My head is tormented because of the police. They

don’t give us peace. They don’t pay attention to our legal status

[in Morocco]. They don’t respect women or children. We are not animals,

even if we live here [in the forest].”<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12"><span>[12]</span></a></span>
    </p>
<p>
      <span>In every one of the 42

accounts of Moroccan security raids, migrants described law enforcement

officials arresting male migrants without conducting any type of identification

or assessments of migrants’ status in Morocco prior to arresting them,

and, in the case of unaccompanied children, without conducting any form of age

determination. They said that police officers routinely arrest male migrants

indiscriminately, even if they have a visa or other documentation showing they have

<p>
      <span>The majority of migrants

Human Rights Watch interviewed in Nador and Oujda reported that officers from

the police, auxiliary force, and <i>gendarmes</i> often robbed them during raids

of the informal camps and when transporting the men captured at the camps to

the Algerian border. </span>
    </p>
<p>
      <span>Ismael M., who lives in one

of the forests outside of Oujda, told Human Rights Watch how the <i>gendarmes</i>

had been coming frequently since December 2011. Robbery is a routine part of

the daily raids, he said: “The <i>gendarmes</i> look for men, they enter

the tents and take phones. We migrants lose our phones every day.”</span>

      <span>In every migrant site that

Human Rights Watch visited, in both Nador and Oujda, migrants said that

Moroccan security forces summarily burned or destroyed their makeshift shelters

and personal property without following any due process procedures for

conducting evictions. Migrants told Human Rights Watch that in the months prior

to the interviews, these raids occurred frequently, most often weekly, and

sometimes several times a week. Human Rights Watch observed the remains of

several makeshift shelters and piles of belongings that had been destroyed by

fire. Migrants told Human Rights Watch that the police had burned the shelters

<p>
      <span>Local organizations have

previously reported on this type of destruction. In September 2012, the Council

of sub-Saharan migrants in Morocco (CMSM - <i>Conseil des migrants subsahariens

au Maroc</i>) and a group that fights for migrant rights and against racism,

the Gadem, reported that police burned down an abandoned house where migrants

had been squatting just outside of Nador.</span>

    </p>
<p>
      <span>Human Rights Watch conducted

several interviews of migrants who had been living in the abandoned house that

the authorities burned down. Antoine K. from Benin had been living there during

the summer of 2012. He told Human Rights Watch how police, <i>gendarmes</i>,

and Auxiliary Forces raided the house on a regular basis over the summer,

sometimes daily, until the migrants who were living there moved deeper into the

forest because they felt unable to remain in the house due to the raids. He

said in August 2012: </span>
    </p>
<blockquote>
      <span>The police started coming

again every day. Some [migrants] would go up to sleep in the forest. One week

later they came and expelled us. The police said they were going to burn the

house down …. On August 27 [2012] they tried to expel us from the white

house. We left. We were staying outside for a week to ten days. We kept getting

pushed back further and further, first to the olive groves, and then to here in

the forest. On October 6, 2012, the police showed us [where to go], they told

us to go into the forest. We thought we would not have any more problems but

after one week, they started coming again. They kept coming until they burned

everything.<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16"><span>[16]</span></a></span>
    </blockquote>
<p>
      <span>While many migrants enter

Morocco without the necessary documentation and visas, others do carry passports

showing that they are lawfully present in Morocco, particularly those from

other West African countries who do not need visas to enter Morocco. When the

authorities burn or otherwise destroy their documents, however, they lose the

proof that they are in the country legally. Antoine K. said that this happened

when the authorities burned down the abandoned house outside Nador. “There

were no negotiations; they burned our bags in the fire after searching them.

They burned many passports.”</span>

    </p>
<p>
      <span>In another site, outside of

the town of Selouane, Human Rights Watch interviewed 11 women who described a

raid in November 2012 during which Moroccan law enforcement officials destroyed

their tent, leaving them without shelter. Four of these women were pregnant

when the shelter was destroyed. In reference to this raid, Sofia K., a woman

from Cameroon, four months pregnant, explained: “I have been in Selouane

four months. We don’t live well here. The police shake us up. I was

traumatized when one day, a month ago, the police came in the morning and

destroyed my tent.”<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18"><span>[18]</span></a></span>
    </p>
<p>
      <span>Another pregnant woman,

Elizabeth S., also from Cameroon, lives in the same site. She described a

similar situation, “The police come nearly every Sunday or Monday and the

men run away. Women don’t run away. They shove us around. Once they

almost took me away but [then] took the others [to be expelled]. They burned

all our tents. I stay here, I can’t walk [she is eight months pregnant].”<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19"><span>[19]</span></a>

The inhabitants of the camp were effectively rendered homeless. </span>
    </p>
<p>
      <span>Interviews conducted with the

42 migrants who experienced or witnessed a police raid of their campsite

strongly suggest that Moroccan officials follow no formal procedure before

dismantling unofficial migrant camps. One exception was a migrant who indicated

that the police presented him with an eviction notice before removing him from

a house where he were squatting in one of the Nador sites that Human Rights

Watch visited.</span>

      </a>
      <span> Every other migrant interviewed by Human Rights Watch

described raids that lacked any of the procedural steps required by

international law, such as written notification and the right to appeal a

decision. </span>
    </p>
<p>
      <span>By destroying the makeshift

tents of migrants during raids, Moroccan enforcement officials may be rendering

migrants homeless. Destruction without due process of shelters may constitute

forced evictions, and may therefore constitute a violation of the right to

housing, which is guaranteed by international human rights treaties to which

Morocco is a party. </span>

<p>
      <span>Of the 42 migrants who

described to Human Rights Watch daily to weekly police raids, 12 said that

Moroccan authorities used violence against them during raids; seven other

migrants said they witnessed such violence. </span>
    </p>
<p>
      <span>One migrant with a physical

disability who used crutches, Hassan N., described the excessive force he said

police used during a raid outside Nador in the summer of 2012:</span>
    </p>
<blockquote>My second refoulement was on June 20, 2012. We had changed

our sleeping grounds and the police came with sticks. I was hit with sticks and

asked why we were here. I was handcuffed and then they grabbed me and hit me 10

or 12 times on my back with a stick. I was bleeding.<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[21]</span></span></span></a>
</blockquote>
<p>A female migrant, who said she was five months pregnant,

told Human Rights Watch about similar violence she experienced during an early

morning raid in one of the sites in early December 2012:</p>
<blockquote>The police came here last Tuesday at 5 or 6 in the morning.

It was the <i>gendarmerie</i> and police together…. They came when we

were sleeping and abused us. They asked me, “where is your husband”

and they beat me. They kicked me in the stomach even though I told them I was

pregnant. They said we are not welcome here. I yelled and eventually they left.

They arrested 8 or 9 of the men.<a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[22]</span></span></span></a>

<p>
      <span>Human Rights Watch

interviewed 67 sub-Saharan migrants in the Oriental region of Morocco, 37 of

whom had been expelled at the border with Algeria at least once. All 37

nonetheless returned to the informal settlements in Morocco. In nearly all the

37 cases, the migrants said that Oujda police transferred them east of Oujda to

the Moroccan Auxiliary Forces stationed at the border with Algeria.</span>

      <span>Morocco does not have

      </i>

Centers for the Temporary Stay of Immigrants) in the Spanish territories of Melilla and Ceuta

or the Purisima centers in Melilla.

Instead, the Moroccan authorities use cells in police stations to hold

undocumented migrants.</span>

<p>
      <span>Some

interviewees were apprehended during or after their attempt to enter one of the

Spanish enclaves: 11 were summarily removed by Spanish authorities in Melilla

and handed over to Moroccan authorities. Most were then taken to a police

station; some were taken directly to the Morocco-Algeria border. </span>
    </p>
<p>
      <span>The

Auxiliary Forces posted along the Algerian border east of Oujda escorted the

arrested migrants toward Algeria and instructed them to walk straight ahead (<i>nishan

</i>in Moroccan Arabic). One-third of the expelled migrants we interviewed

described being forced to cross the border or threatened with violence if they

did not leave Morocco. </span>
    </p>
<p>
      <span>Sometimes

migrants were directly taken to the border late at night. The timing of these

expulsions, usually carried out between 9 p.m. and 2 a.m., and the fact that

the migrants were not handed over directly to Algerian authorities, suggest

that expulsions take place unofficially. </span>
    </p>
<p>
      <span>None of the 37 migrants who

had been expelled were provided access to a lawyer or an interpreter, they told

Human Rights Watch. Generally, the police did not provide them with a statement

or document charging them with any violation, or bring them before a judge, or

provide any opportunity to challenge their impending expulsion. When the police

did provide a statement to them, the migrants told Human Rights Watch that the

police pressured them to sign it even though it was in Arabic, which they did

not understand. </span>
    </p>
<p>
      <span>Gadem, a Moroccan anti-racist

organization that works with migrants, evaluated the removal and expulsions of

migrants from Moroccan territory between 2004 and 2008. Its report, “The

Human Rights of Sub-Saharan Migrants in Morocco,” found fundamental gaps

in the protection of vulnerable groups from expulsions and violations of due

process during the removals.<a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25"><span>[25]</span></a>

Human Rights Watch’s research shows that these gaps remain.</span>

<p>
      <span>This chapter examines how

Moroccan authorities continue to expel migrants from Morocco at the Algerian

border without following due process. Migrants’ rights are violated at

various stages, from the time they are arrested to their expulsion at the

Algerian border. </span>

      <span>None of

the migrants interviewed by Human Rights Watch who had been expelled from

Morocco described receiving any information about their rights, nor did the

authorities give them the opportunity to contact consular representatives of

their country of origin. None of the

      <span>Before expelling or “returning”

Human Rights Watch interviewed reported having received such a statement, and 2

of these 5 said they could not understand or did not get the opportunity to

read the statement, but they were coerced to sign. One migrant, Eric P.,

described his arrest in Selouane, near Nador, and his subsequent expulsion:</span>
    </p>
<blockquote>
      <span>The police took us in vans

to the Nador police station, where many others were put in cells.… The

police asked us our names, nationalities. They got us to sign a statement (<i>procès

around 6 p.m., the police took us to Oujda in a bus…. They drove us to

      <span>I was arrested twice in

2012, in January and March [when he was 16 years old]. The first time I was

taken to the police station, my prints were taken…. The police did not

ask anything. I was not taken to a cell; [they took us] straight to the …

border. I ran back because the Algerian police were there, holding guns and

telling us to go back. The second time, I was begging on a Friday and the

<blockquote>
      <span>[The police] took us to the Nador Commissariat…. They took our

[finger]prints and photos. I didn’t see a lawyer. We were in the

group, and brought to the Algerian border and expelled as a group. Collective

expulsions documented by Human Rights Watch ranged from groups of 3 migrants to

groups as large as 52 migrants. In no case did the Moroccan authorities notify

any of the individuals of a judicial decision to expel or return them to the

border. </span>
    </p>
<p>
      <span>Article 22 of the Migrant

Workers Convention, to which Morocco is a state party, prohibits the collective

expulsion of migrant workers: “Migrant workers and members of their

families shall not be subject to measures of collective expulsion. Each case of

expulsion shall be examined and decided individually.”</span>

      <span>The decision to remove a

      <span> However, none of the 37 migrants Human Rights Watch

interviewed who were expelled at the Algerian border were given the opportunity

to choose or to discuss the country of their return. Gadem, an NGO that

provides support to migrants in Morocco, observed that Morocco neither formally

decides on the proper return country nor seeks or obtains Algeria’s

agreement to receive deportees prior to their expulsion: </span>
    </p>
<blockquote>
      <span>Apart from the fact that the

administration has not seemed to have made any decision determining the return

countries, it seems very hazardous to consider Algeria as a place where

migrants who have been returned in such a manner would be “legally

admissible,” considering that said country has apparently not agreed to

receive returned individuals.<a href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39"><span>[39]</span></a></span>
    </blockquote>
<p><span>In fact, not one of the

migrants Human Rights Watch interviewed said that the Moroccan authorities had

officially handed them over to Algerian authorities when expelling them at the

Morocco-Algeria border. On the contrary, after Moroccan officials forced them

to cross into Algeria, they said that Algerian border control agents mistreated

them. </span>Every single migrant interviewed by Human Rights Watch whom the

Moroccan authorities arrested and subsequently expelled at the Algerian border

said that Algerian law enforcement officials they encountered forced them back

to Morocco. </p>
<blockquote>
      <span>Moroccan

authorities arrested Eric P., a migrant from Ghana, during a raid in Nador a

few days before Human Rights Watch interviewed him. He described what happened

after Moroccan authorities forced him and other migrants across the Algerian

border outside of Oujda:</span>
    </blockquote>
<blockquote>On the other side, when we crossed, the Algerian border

guards arrested us, searched us and took the money and phones they found on

some of us. Those who had money were released, while those who didn’t

have money were beaten. I didn’t have money so they took my jacket and

beat me. We ran away and got back to Morocco the same day. We walked for five

hours to reach Oujda by 6:00 a.m. the next day.<a href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[40]</span></span></span></a>

<p>Another migrant described what happened after Moroccan

authorities arrested him and other migrants near Melilla and then expelled them

at the Algerian border:</p>
<blockquote>When we crossed the Algerian border, the [Algerian] guards

arrested us, searched us. They found some money and a cell phone on me. They

gave them back to me and they pushed us back to the Moroccan border. We crossed

and came back to Oujda.<a href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[41]</span></span></span></a>

<p>Moroccan national immigration law prohibits the expulsion of

specific protection under international law as well. <span>According

to article 29 of Law 02-03, </span>“No pregnant foreign woman and no

      <span> However, Human Rights Watch found that there were

nonetheless cases when Moroccan security forces arrested and expelled pregnant

women in contravention of provisions in the national law on immigration. One

woman told Human Rights Watch that security forces expelled her from Morocco

after arresting her and her sister in Fez, on December 2, 2012 when she was

three to four months pregnant. </span>
    </p>
<p>
      <span>In

Oujda, Human Rights Watch interviewed the two sisters shortly after they found

their way back to the ‘Fac’ campsite on the university campus of

Oujda after walking back from the Algerian border the previous night. The

sisters, ages 27 and 18 from Cameroon, had been living in the city of Fez until

then; one said she was three to four months<span></span>pregnant

while the other had an infant child. When they went to get milk for the baby,

the police arrested them. Despite their telling the police that the

six-month-old baby was still at home, the police took the two women to the

police station and held them there for four to five hours before putting them

on a bus to Oujda. The police took them to another police station in Oujda,

where the younger sister told the police she was pregnant. Nevertheless, the

police expelled the two sisters in the middle of the night, at the Algerian

border with a group of 30 other migrants. Human Rights Watch later heard that

both women managed to return to Fez. The baby remained in Fez, where other

migrants cared for him during his mother’s expulsion.<a href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44"><span>[44]</span></a></span>

      <span>
        <span>Children</span>
      </span>
    </h3>
<p>
      <span>Moroccan law enforcement

officials expelled eight of the nine sub-Saharan unaccompanied migrant children

Human Rights Watch interviewed in Nador and Oujda. These children ranged

between 12 and 17 years old at the time of their expulsion, according to what

they told Human Rights Watch. The one who was not expelled was a 14-year-old

girl, who said that the <i>gendarmes</i> were only arresting men during raids

of the informal camp where she lived. </span>
    </p>
<p>
      <span>In none of these cases did

the Moroccan authorities provide appropriate care or conduct age determinations

after the children informed them that they were younger than 18 years of age.

On the contrary, these children described being treated like everyone else from

the time of apprehension to their expulsion. </span>
    </p>
<p>
      <span>A 12-year-old unaccompanied migrant

boy from Cameroon, Jean-Luc, described the chain of events after his arrest in

Nador in November 2012: “I spent one week in a cell with no food, with

five, six other people, including adult men. There was no interview.… I

never saw a lawyer. I was put on a bus and taken to the border behind the Gala café.

We were given to the military in a small house [at the border] and the police

threw us across the border. They did not hit us. They stole phones, six phones,

and shoes.”</span>

<p><span>In February 2013, the UN

Committee on the Rights of the Child urged states to “expeditiously and

completely cease the detention of children on the basis of their immigration

status,” arguing that such detention is never in the child’s best

interest.</span><a href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[46]</span></span></span></a><span> In 2006, the Committee stated that “unaccompanied

or separated children should not, as a general rule, be detained,” and

“detention cannot be justified solely on… their migratory or

residence status, or lack thereof.” </span><a href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47"><span>[47]</span></a> The

Convention on the Rights of the Child and the International Covenant on Civil

and Political Rights require states parties to separate adults from unrelated

children in detention, in the exceptional circumstances where children are

detained,<a href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[48]</span></span></span></a> and the

<p>
      <span>Morocco does not provide

unaccompanied migrant children in its territory with guardianship, despite its

obligations under international law. The rapidity of the process, the lack of a

translator and of legal representation prevents migrant children from having

the opportunity to establish their age. In the expulsion of children from

Morocco, Human Rights Watch found that no age determination procedure was

conducted and that their status as children was ignored, even when they

volunteered their age. In the cases Human Rights Watch examined, Morocco did

not appear to consider the child’s best interest when determining

immigration cases, contrary to what the Committee on the Rights of the Child

has prescribed:</span>
    </p>
<blockquote>A determination of what is in the best interests of the

child requires a clear and comprehensive assessment of the child’s

identity, including her or his nationality, upbringing, ethnic, cultural and

linguistic background, particular vulnerabilities and protection needs.<a href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[50]</span></span></span></a>

<p>
      <span>In 2011,

the UN Committee Against Torture said that Morocco should investigate

allegations that migrants had been subjected to “ill-treatment or

excessive use of force” during expulsions and that Morocco “</span>
      <span>should take steps to ensure that the legal

    </p>
<p>
      <span>In

      </a>
      <span> Moroccan authorities claimed

that “the law […] makes a distinction between a return to the

border and expulsion. A return to the border is a legal act, accompanied by all

the legal and procedural guarantees provided against any person who enters or

exits Moroccan territory by exits or places other than border posts, or who

remained on Moroccan territory beyond the authorized length of their

      <span>Similarly, in a letter to

were lawful:</span>

<blockquote>
      <span>In accordance with the

well-established rule of international law, <i>returns to the border</i>, taking

due account of the need to respect the dignity and rights of migrants, as well

as the rights of defense, including the exhaustion of appeals against the

decision of removal, are carried out by transporting the migrant, subject to a

legal measure of return to the border, to the last point of infiltration onto

national territory. In this respect, one must remember that Morocco's land

borders with Algeria, 1,601 Km long, are the infiltration point of virtually

all foreigners entering the country illegally.</span>
      <a href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54">

            </span>
          </span>
        </span>
      </a>
    </blockquote>
<p><span>The Moroccan authorities also

deny expelling migrants or forcing them to leave Moroccan territory:

“Within the framework of the management of migration, the Moroccan

authorities, acting in strict legality, never forced migrants to leave the

country and enter Algeria.”<a href="#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55"><span>[55]</span></a> In this letter, the Moroccan authorities assert that

they do not conduct any expulsions and also that any returns to the border are

legal when they have followed the procedural requirements ensuring

migrants’ rights to due process, including their right to contest the

decision of return. </span>The Moroccan government previously emphasized this

distinction and the legality of returns to the border in its initial report to

the Committee on the Rights of <span>Migrants, as

well as in its response to this Committee’s follow-up questions.</span><a href="#_ftn56" name="_ftnref56"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[56]</span></span></span></span></a><span> This distinction between expulsions and

“returns to the border” does exist in Law 02-03 regulating

immigration: articles 21-24 deal with “returns to the border,”

articles 25-27 with expulsions, and articles 28-33 with both, all of which

outline procedural responsibilities on the part of Moroccan authorities for

conducting either expulsions or “returns to the border.”</span></p>
<p>
      <span>However, in practice, the

distinction between expulsions and “returns to the border” is far

from clear. Migrants said they are either coerced to leave the Moroccan

territory with the threat of violence, or pushed toward the Algerian border by

Moroccan security forces. This treatment effectively expels migrants from

Morocco, as opposed to “legal” “returns to the border”

from which migrants allegedly entered the country. Contrary to the Moroccan

government’s claims, all the cases Human Rights Watch documented of

forced removals of migrants from Morocco to the Algerian border were, in

practice, expulsions. </span>
    </p>
<p>
      <span>As shown throughout this

chapter, victim and witness evidence consistently show that law enforcement

authorities who arrest migrants in the northeast region of Morocco transfer

migrants to the Oujda police station with no opportunity to appear before a

judge. The Oujda police then subject them to summary expulsion from Moroccan

territory, often accompanied by violence, theft, and other abuses. <span>The Moroccan authorities routinely violate migrants’

rights to due process in this encounter.</span></span>

      <span>Human Rights Watch’s

research found that Moroccan authorities beat children and adults when they

attempted to cross into the Spanish enclave of Melilla. These enclaves, located

in the northeast region of Morocco, bring Europe’s external borders to

the southern side of the Mediterranean Sea. Both Moroccan nationals and third country

nationals try to enter the Spanish enclaves by scaling the fences that protect

the land borders. They also attempt to reach these enclaves or cross to the Spanish

mainland on inflatable motorized boats. Melilla’s borders are protected

by three rows of razor-wire fences reaching six meters tall. The fences are

monitored with the use of infrared cameras, and motion and noise detectors.</span>

      <span>Olivier S., another migrant

from Cameroon, told Human Rights Watch that after he and a group of migrants

reached Melilla on a motorized inflatable boat in April 2012, the <i>Guardia

Civil</i> handed them back to Moroccan <i>gendarmes</i> who beat the men, even

though they had full custody over them: </span>
    </p>
<blockquote>
      <span>Sixteen of us were given to

12 Moroccan <i>gendarmes</i>. As soon as they got us, they took us to the

forest one hour away. We were told to lay on the ground on our stomachs with

our hands above our hands, in a row. They started to hit us. Many of them were

young, proud to hit us. Not all of them were in uniform. They kicked us with

their boots, slapped us, hit us with sticks, baseball bat-like sticks.<a href="#_ftn67" name="_ftnref67"><span>[67]</span></a></span>
    </blockquote>
<p>
      <span>Two other migrants, Bouba L.

and Pierrot D., described similar violence on the Moroccan side of the border:</span>
    </p>
<blockquote>
      <span>They

strike you with wood…. They beat you up routinely. I was told to lie on

my stomach so they hit me on my back and butt. They searched me, but since I

didn’t have much they left me. They kept my clothes and sent me to Oujda.<a href="#_ftn68" name="_ftnref68"><span>[68]</span></a></span>
    </blockquote>
<blockquote>
      <span>The Moroccan military

[Auxiliary Forces] took me [aside]. There were more than three of them. They

hit me with [olive tree wood] sticks, very hard…. There were four [of us]

and they hit all four of us for about 30 minutes and then took us to the town

of Nador. I couldn’t walk. They hit me everywhere. I was bleeding but I

didn’t see a doctor. I was taken to the police station, to the

refoulement cell. In there, I was fingerprinted and photographed and then put

on a bus at 5 p.m [to Oujda].<a href="#_ftn69" name="_ftnref69"><span>[69]</span></a></span>
    </blockquote>
<p>Jean-Luc M., the unaccompanied 12-year-old Cameroonian boy,

told Human Rights Watch of his treatment after being returned from Melilla:</p>
<blockquote>
      <span>The

Moroccans hit me…. and broke my arm. I was put in a police car and taken

to the hospital. I received medical attention, and the next day, the police

came to get me. I was barefoot and put on the [police] bus straight away. I was

left behind the [Oujda] airport and came back to Oujda barefoot.</span>

<p>
      <span>Jean-Luc said Moroccan

security forces hit him on three separate occasions.</span>
    </p>
<p>MSF’s March 2013 report, “Violence,

Vulnerability and Migration: Trapped at the Gates of Europe,” documents

injuries from police violence sustained by sub-Saharan African migrants in Morocco’s

Oriental region. It says that MSF provided medical assistance to 500 people in

Oujda and 600 people in Nador for violence-related injuries in 2012.<a href="#_ftn71" name="_ftnref71"><span>[71]</span></a>

According to MSF, 64 percent of migrants claimed that their injuries were

caused by direct violence by Moroccan security forces, 21 percent said that

thieves assaulted them, and 7 percent said they were beaten by the Spanish <i>Guardia

Civil</i>.</p>
<p><span>Human Rights Watch finds that

this excessive use of force by Moroccan security forces at the border with the

Spanish enclave of Melilla against migrants, and the violence migrants endured

at their informal settlements, has at times reached the level of cruel, inhuman

or degrading treatment, in violation of human rights law. </span>Persistent

abuses of this nature against migrants may cause serious psychological harm to

them, in addition to the physical harm they may have already suffered. </p>

        <span>Spanish Authorities’ Use of

Force and Summary Removals in Melilla</span>
      </span>
    </h2>
<p>
      <span>Many migrants travel to

Morocco with the aim of reaching Europe, usually by attempting to enter one of

the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla. Migrants who try to cross into the

enclaves hope to go undetected until they reach the CETI migrant detention

center (</span>
      <i>
        <span>Los Centros de Estancia

Temporal de Inmigrantes</span>

      <span>–

Centers for the Temporary Stay of Immigrants), which they perceive to be a potential stepping stone for reaching

mainland Spain and being able to stay in Europe. </span>
    </p>
<p>Fourteen of the 15 migrants interviewed by Human Rights

Watch who succeeded in crossing the Melilla border reported that the Spanish <i>Guardia

Civil</i> used force against them. Eight migrants said that the <i>Guardia

Civil</i> at the border kicked them with boots and beat them with police batons

when they crossed into Melilla.</p>
<p>
      <span>Jean-Luc M., the 12-year-old migrant boy from Cameroon,

told Human Rights Watch about police brutality that he said he suffered on two

occasions, just after crossing into Melilla: </span>
    </p>
<blockquote>
      <span>In early October [2012 and

November 2012], I got across the third fence and entered Melilla. The <i>Guardia

Civil</i> hit me; they shocked me with a neutralizer [apparently a Taser]. Both

times I was hit with boots and belts…. . They didn’t ask me

anything and gave me back to the Moroccans.</span>

<p>Another migrant, Omar B., described similar violence:</p>
<blockquote>
      <span>My first attempt [to cross

from Morocco to Melilla] was in April 2012 around 2 a.m., but the police used

teargas and beat us on our joints. I was able to run away and hid in the forest

[in Morocco]. My second attempt was in July, during Ramadan. We succeeded in

jumping over the fence but the <i>Guardia</i> detained us before arriving to

the camp where migrants live. We were 27 people. [The <i>Guardia Civil</i>]

beat us with sticks and handcuffed our hands. They made us walk to the border

gate and handed us over to the Moroccans. They [the Moroccans] later beat us on

our legs with batons.</span>

<p>
      <span>François

F., a 28-year-old migrant from Cameroon, made three attempts to enter Melilla,

and was summarily returned each time. He said, “I made it to Melilla, but

the <i>Guardia Civil</i> has heat sensors and arrested us. They hit three guys

with sticks and told us not to come back.”</span>

      </a>
    </p>
<p>
      <span>MSF also

reported that the <i>Guardia Civil</i> used rubber bullets at the end of 2012

to prevent migrants from entering Melilla. As stated in their report, “In

late 2012 MSF teams treated patients who stated that the <i>Guardia Civil</i>

used rubber bullets to apprehend them and beat them.”<a href="#_ftn75" name="_ftnref75"><span>[75]</span></a></span>
    </p>
<p>Of the 15 migrants interviewed by

Human Rights Watch who successfully crossed into Melilla, 11, including 5

children, said the Spanish authorities handed them over directly to the

Moroccan authorities without determining whether they were in need of

international protection. (The other four migrants reported that they were

returned to Morocco, but not directly handed over to the authorities). In doing

so, the <i>Guardia Civil</i> contravened Spain’s obligations under the EU

Charter of Fundamental Rights, which includes a right to seek asylum, and the

EU returns directive. This directive, adopted in 2008 by the European

Parliament sets out minimum standards for the treatment of undocumented

migrants during returns, and requires EU member states to ensure that any

returns to countries outside the EU respect the principle of nonrefoulement,

and take account of the right to family life and the best interests of the

child.<a href="#_ftn76" name="_ftnref76"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[76]</span></span></span></a></p>
<p>
      <span>The migrants who spoke

with Human Rights Watch said that the Spanish authorities followed none of

these procedural requirements before handing them over to Moroccan authorities.

</span>
    </p>
<p>
      <span>Summary removals put the

migrants at risk of further violence by Moroccan security forces and at risk of

being expelled into Algeria. Since numerous journalists and NGOs have reported

abuses by Moroccan security forces, it is reasonable to expect that the Spanish

authorities should be aware that migrants face a risk of ill-treatment at the

hands of the Moroccan authorities.</span>

      </a>
      <span> For this reason, as well, these summary removals may

also constitute a violation of Spain’s obligations under EU and human

rights law. </span>
    </p>
<p>
      <span>Several migrants told Human

Rights Watch, they begged the <i>Guardia Civil</i> not to return them to the

Moroccan authorities because of the violence the migrants expected to face in

custody. One migrant, Nicolas E., described his encounter with the <i>Guardia

Civil</i>:</span>
    </p>
<blockquote>
      <span>I was

alone and I was running across to the third fence. The <i>Guardia Civil</i>

intercepted me and told me that I would be taken to the <i>campo</i> [CETI]

after the hospital [because he was injured] but instead they sent me back to

Morocco. They told me, “Get the hell out! You know that if you come here,

you know you get a caning…. You know you are going to be hit [by the

Moroccans].”</span>

handed me over to the Moroccan military who hit me with wood everywhere [on my

body].<a href="#_ftn80" name="_ftnref80"><span>[80]</span></a></span>
    </blockquote>
<p>
      <span>In the three cases examined

by Human Rights Watch, Spanish border officials failed to screen adequately for

unaccompanied children or to give asylum seekers the opportunity to lodge

claims for international protection. By removing migrants so rapidly, Spanish

authorities in Melilla violated the children’s rights to see specialized

service providers and interpreters and to receive information about applying

for asylum. </span>
    </p>
<p>
      <span>Human Rights Watch

interviewed two migrant children, 14 and 17 years of age, who had been living

in La Purísima Concepción Fort, a reception center for minors in

Melilla, for one year and seven months respectively, until two plainclothes

inspectors apprehended them in the streets of Melilla outside of the CETI

migrant detention center where they were visiting friends. As Amin K., age 14,

explained to Human Rights Watch, they were then quickly and summarily expelled

from Melilla: </span>
    </p>
<blockquote>
      <span>I left

to visit friends in the big <i>campo</i> [CETI] – we have the right to

walk around and the police don’t usually bother you. I was with a friend

and an inspector took us both. They were dressed in civilian clothing and asked

us to go into their car. They told us nothing was wrong, that they just had

questions to ask. They told us nothing would happen. We sat in the back. There

were two inspectors in the front of the car and they asked us how we got into

Melilla. We told them that we didn’t come today, but they wanted the

color of the car and the name of the man who brought us to Melilla. We

explained to them that we had been there for one year and that we were at the <i>Purisima</i>.

They threatened to deport us if we lied. We assured them that we were not

lying, but they took us straight to the border and called the <i>Guardia Civil</i>

to open the door at the fence. When we arrived [on the Moroccan side], there

were three Moroccans there and they talked to them in Arabic. They didn’t

let us call the center even though we had told them that they could call or we

could go there with them so they could verify our story. We told them our age,

we talked to them in Spanish. They gave us to the Moroccans.</span>

<p>
      <span>Amin’s companion,

Ahmed, age 17, gave his account of the same incident, saying that Spanish

officials watched from their side of the border as Moroccan guards beat him

after they turned him over to them:</span>
    </p>
<blockquote>
      <span>We got

in the car and [the Spanish inspectors] drove and asked us questions.

“How did you get into Melilla?” They wanted to know the name of the

person and the car that brought us. We talked until we got to the border. They

took us to the border discreetly, under a bridge. We thought they just wanted

to scare us. There were two cars of the <i>Guardia Civil</i> with two people in

each and two motorcycles. …We told them we were minors, but they expelled

us from the car. They opened the fence at the border where cars go through and

three Moroccans came, one military and two in civilian clothes. The inspector

talked in Arabic, gave us to the Moroccans, and closed the fence. The inspector

stayed watching [from the Spanish side of the fence] while [the Moroccan

security force] hit us. We were making noise and then the inspector asked the

Moroccans to take us away. They kicked us; they took our jackets and clothes.

We were in socks and underwear.</span>

<h2>
      <span>
        <span>Context before September 2013</span>
      </span>
    </h2>
<p>
      <span>On paper, Morocco appears to

uphold international standards for the protection of refugees and asylum

seekers. It is party to the 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol,

ratified in 1956 and 1971 respectively. It is also party to the Convention Governing

the Specific Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa. The August 29, 1957 Royal

Decree 2-57-1256 established the modalities for implementing the Refugee

Convention in national law. The decree established the <i>Bureau des

Réfugiés et Apatrides</i> (BRA – National Office for

Refugees and Stateless Persons), the administrative body in charge of

implementing asylum procedures and the specific role of UNHCR in these

procedures. Article 2 of the 1957 Decree states that the BRA “recognizes

the status of refugee of any person under the mandate of the UN High

Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) or who meets the definitions from Article I

of the Geneva Convention of 28 July 1951.”</span>
      <a href="#_ftn83" name="_ftnref83">

          </span>
        </span>
      </a>
    </p>
<p>
      <span>Until 2004, asylum seekers approached

the UNHCR honorary delegation, which registered their claim and conducted

refugee status determination. After UNHCR recognized asylum seekers, they would

contact the BRA to file a separate asylum application. However, recognition of

refugee status by UNHCR had no official bearing for national authorities. In

practice, the BRA usually confirmed UNHCR’s recognition of refugee

status, ensuring that recognized refugees would be protected, provided

temporary residence, and the necessary documentation to lead their lives in

Moroccan society.</span>
    </p>
<p>
      <span>The Moroccan authorities

suspended this system in 2004 with no official notification. The absence of BRA

activity since 2004 indicated that, in practice, UNHCR was the sole agency

responsible for conducting refugee status determination from that point.</span>
      <a href="#_ftn84" name="_ftnref84">
        <span>[84]</span>
      </a>
      <span> This absence effectively meant that the government

was failing to implement the 1957 Decree, even though that law still authorizes

the government to process asylum claims.</span>

        <span>[85]</span>
      </a>

<p>
      <span>In a letter to Human Rights

Watch, Moroccan authorities said that the Ministry of the Interior and the

Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation manage the political and technical

issues relating to asylum while the General Directorate for National Security

is responsible for providing residency permits to recognized refugees. The

Moroccan authorities also told Human Rights Watch that an ad hoc inter-ministerial

commission was completing a major project to upgrade the Moroccan asylum

system.</span>

highlighting the plight of migrants in Morocco. The CNDH recommended that the

documented and undocumented, as well as the rights of asylum seekers and

refugees. The CNDH endorsed the establishment of a “national legal and

institutional framework of asylum.”</span>

      <span> In response to these

recommendations, and ordered the government to prioritize a process for

regularizing the status of migrants whose asylum claims UNHCR had already

recognized. The government acted swiftly and the BRA was (re)inaugurated on

September 25, 2013 in Rabat, working in coordination with UNHCR to examine

asylum cases, prioritizing the 853 refugees UNHCR already recognized.</span>

        <span>Challenges to Implementation</span>
      </span>
    </h2>
<p>
      <span>Human Rights Watch’s

research shows the challenges that many refugees, asylum-seekers, and migrants

face in reaching UNHCR offices and registering for refugee status. UNHCR mainly

works with those who are able to come to their office in Rabat, a difficult and

risky task for most asylum seekers. UNHCR has an implementing partner in Oujda,

the Moroccan Organization for Human Rights (Organisation Marocaine des Droits

Humains, OMDH), but it is not well known to most migrants at this usual first

point of entry from Algeria.</span>
      <a href="#_ftn98" name="_ftnref98">
        <span>[98]</span>
      </a>
    </p>
<p>
      <span>Other local organizations in

Oujda try to help newly arrived asylum seekers or recently expelled refugees

and asylum seekers to travel to Rabat safely. However, as many migrants told

Human Rights Watch, their darker skin makes them stand out on public

transportation, which increases the likelihood police will stop them to verify

their status in Morocco while they are en route to Rabat. </span>
    </p>
<p>
      <span>Although

the Moroccan government and the Cooperation Agreement (<i>Accord de

Siège)</i> assert that UNHCR “has free access to refugees and

other persons of concern throughout the country” and “upon common

agreement, the possibility to open other offices in the country,” access

to sensitive regions and airport transit zones is not yet systematic.</span>
      <a href="#_ftn99" name="_ftnref99">
        <span>[99]</span>
      </a>
      <span> However, UNHCR told Human Rights

Watch it is working with Moroccan authorities to establish a stronger presence

in the Oriental region where many migrants enter Morocco.</span>

Expulsions of Asylum Seekers and Refugees</span>

<p>
      <span>Even with UNHCR

recognition, refugees and asylum seekers are vulnerable to forced expulsion

from Morocco. Human Rights Watch interviewed two refugees recognized by UNHCR in

Algeria and three asylum seekers who formally applied with UNHCR in Morocco. </span>
    </p>
<p>
      <span>Hassan N., an

asylum seeker with limited mobility, said Moroccan authorities expelled him at

the Algerian border despite his having a UNHCR-issued asylum seeker certificate

issued in Morocco, which he showed to Human Rights Watch during his interview.

He told Human Rights Watch that the expulsion occurred after an August 2012 raid

on an abandoned house near Nador where he and other migrants were living. Hassan

described how the police ignored the UNHCR certificate he showed them: “I

showed my HCR paper but I was [expelled] again. They said they didn’t

care and took me back to the border that same night…. Whenever I’ve been arrested and taken to the

police station, and they ask nationalities, the police told me to put my HCR card

away.”</span>

possible asylum claims but who either did not have enough information about how

to seek asylum in Morocco or said they had been rebuffed by UNHCR’s

they attempted to contact that organization in Oujda. </span>

      <span>Olivier, a

Cameroonian, told Human Rights Watch that he could not return to Cameroon

because he feared he would be killed by the authorities. Olivier said he had

left the army rather than participate in, what he described as, the unjustified

killing of civilians. He said when he spoke to the OMDH about applying for

asylum in Morocco, “they told me that Cameroon is not a country where

there is turbulence. I wasn’t getting anywhere with my questions and I

<p>
      <span>The

human rights abuses committed by Moroccan security forces cannot be seen in

isolation from the efforts of the European Union (EU) and individual EU member

states to prevent irregular migrants from reaching EU territory. This is a core

element of the EU’s migration and asylum externalization strategy, which

aims to shift the burden and responsibility for migrants, asylum seekers, and

refugees away from the EU and onto its neighbors. </span>
    </p>
<p>
      <span>For more than a decade, the

EU has been institutionalizing efforts to tackle irregular migration into

Europe, particularly by enhancing the capacity of neighboring countries in the

Mediterranean basin to prevent the entry and exit of irregular migrants. Like

other countries just outside the EU’s external borders—such as Libya,

Ukraine, and Turkey—Morocco has become part of the buffer zone for the

EU.</span>

<p>
      <span>Morocco and Spain cooperate

bilaterally in the management of their shared borders and sea areas. Since

2004, the Moroccan <i>Gendarmerie Royale</i> and the Spanish <i>Guardia Civil</i>

have worked jointly to patrol the Mediterranean Sea and the Strait of Gibraltar

to prevent undocumented migrants from reaching European shores.<a href="#_ftn107" name="_ftnref107"><span>[107]</span></a>

Some also argue that the introduction of Morocco’s 2003 law on

immigration (Law 02-03) was a response to EU pressures for stronger migration

controls in Morocco.<a href="#_ftn108" name="_ftnref108"><span>[108]</span></a>

Spain and Morocco have developed agreements on border management, often by

negotiating on other issues, such as economic development. For example, article

7 of the 2007 agreement between Morocco and Spain on unaccompanied migrant

children included Spain’s commitment to “collaborate on the

co-financing of prevention measures, namely those favoring the socio-economic

development of regions with high migration potentiality.”</span>

      <span>Morocco

concluded a Readmission Agreement with Spain in 1992, followed by a Memorandum

of Understanding in 2003 and a Police Cooperation Agreement in 2012, all geared

toward managing the return of third-country nationals and Moroccan nationals

the United Kingdom (2011).</span>

<p>
      <span>The 1992 readmission

agreement between Spain and Morocco, still currently in effect, explicitly

binds both parties to respect minimum human rights standards but the wording of

the agreement appears to create loopholes to human rights compliance. For

example, Article 3 (d) of the agreement stipulates that there is no obligation

to readmit anyone who is recognized as a refugee by the requesting country in

accordance with the 1951 Geneva Convention,</span>

        </span>
      </a>
      <span> rather than saying the sending (requesting) state has

an obligation not to return refugees. Similarly, article 8 (d) states that

transit for expulsion “could” be denied if a migrant risks ill

treatment in the destination country,</span>

      <span> which makes nonrefoulement on the basis of risk of

ill treatment discretionary instead of obligatory, as it is under the European

Convention on Human Rights.</span>
    </p>
<p>
      <span>Other agreements have less

ambiguous references to international human rights treaties: for example, the

2007 readmission agreement between Morocco and Spain on <span>unaccompanied migrant children stressed the importance of treating

these young migrants in accordance with international law and human rights

conventions, specifically referencing the </span><span>Convention on the Rights of the Child.</span></span>

the 2007 readmission agreement on unaccompanied child migrants, Human Rights

number of existing bilateral readmission agreements between Morocco and EU

      <span>In 2010, the Council of

evaluated the use of readmission agreements by EU member states and, noting

general deficiencies in the human rights guarantees of current readmission

agreements, suggested that:</span>
    </p>
<blockquote>
      <span>All readmission agreements

should contain clear provisions protecting the rights of irregular migrants and

asylum seekers. These must include their rights to liberty and freedom from

arbitrary detention, protection against torture or other ill-treatment, their

rights to access to a fair and satisfactory asylum procedure, and protection

from <i>refoulement</i> and return to a country or territory where they would

be at risk of serious human rights violations. Monitoring should be aimed at

the respect of these provisions.<a href="#_ftn124" name="_ftnref124"><span>[124]</span></a></span>
    </blockquote>
<p>
      <span>This report also said that

irregular migrants should not be sent to a transit country where their basic

social and economic rights would not be met. The report states:</span>
    </p>
<blockquote>The sending country should always assure access to minimum

economic, social and cultural rights for irregular migrants as long as they are

still in the sending country. […] The rapporteur is of the opinion that

it is contrary to the human dignity of irregular migrants to have them removed

to a country which is not their country of origin and in which they are likely

to be denied access to basic rights such as the right to housing, health care,

primary education, work and social welfare, in particular if they can be

supposed to become stranded in that third country.<a href="#_ftn125" name="_ftnref125"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[125]</span></span></span></a><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"></span>
</blockquote>
<p><span>In a 2011 report on the

EU’s role in relation to migration flows stemming from instability, the

European Parliament’s Committee on Foreign Affairs </span>“urge[d]

the Commission to ensure that any readmission agreement signed by the EU and

<p>
      <span>The Council of Europe and the

European Parliament have both stressed that readmission agreements should

operate in accordance with international human rights standards, particularly

in relation to asylum seekers and refugees in need of protection under the 1951

Geneva Convention or migrants whose return to a destination country would

expose them to the threat of cruel or inhuman and degrading treatment. </span>
    </p>
<p>
      <span>Before

the EU enters into a readmission agreement with Morocco, as planned according

to the EU-Morocco Mobility Partnership Agreement, the European Commission

should monitor implementation of existing readmission agreements. This

monitoring should include assessing whether nonrefoulement obligations are

respected and whether all persons returned to Morocco are treated humanely and

provided effective remedies for protection claims. This assessment should form

an integral part of any decision to enter into an EU readmission agreement with

Morocco, as well as when any such agreement comes into force.</span>

      <span> In its September 2013 report,

the National Human Rights Council (CNDH), a state-funded institution that

reports to the King, acknowledged that the EU has contributed to

Morocco’s efforts to curb irregular migration to Europe: </span>
    </p>
<blockquote>In 2003, a law on the entry and residency of foreigners,

illegal emigration and immigration was adopted, followed in 2007 by the signing

of an agreement with the UNHCR, delegating the review and the granting of

asylum applications. Simultaneously, and with the support of the European

Union, a policy of control of illegal emigration has been put in place, with

real successes as evidenced by the numbers of arrests and the statements of

satisfaction from various European countries.<a href="#_ftn130" name="_ftnref130"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[130]</span></span></span></a>

<p>
      <span>The EU provided aid to

Several projects funded by the Aeneas Program were structured to fight

funded border management activities including “training courses on

<p>
      <span>The European Neighborhood

Policy Instrument (ENPI) replaced the MEDA programs in 2007. The ENP-Morocco

Action Plan outlines key actions for cooperation, one of which is the

“effective management of migration flows, including the signing of a

readmission agreement with the European Community.”</span>

      </a>
    </p>
<p>
      <span>Morocco’s participation

in the ENP led to the June 2013 Mobility Partnership Agreement between Morocco

and the EU, in which two of the stated objectives were “to strengthen

cooperation on migration and development,” and “to combat illegal

immigration, networks involved in the trafficking and smuggling of human

beings, and to promote an effective return and readmission policy while

respecting fundamental rights.”</span>
      <a href="#_ftn144" name="_ftnref144">

      </a>
    </p>
<p>
      <span>The EU has recognized some of

the human rights concerns relating to the treatment of sub-Saharan migrants in

Morocco. In March 2013, the EU high representative for foreign affairs and

security policy reported on the implementation of the ENP, saying:</span>
    </p>
<blockquote>The issue of international protection and asylum is now

present among the actions identified in the Partnership for Mobility and it is

likely that, together with the EU and participating Member States, this topic will

receive strong support. A regular dialogue between the Moroccan government and

the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) exists and the

Moroccan government has indicated that a national law on the right to asylum is

in preparation. However, several cases of expulsions of persons falling within

the criteria for protection and cases of violence were reported.<a href="#_ftn145" name="_ftnref145"><span>[145]</span></a>
</blockquote>
<p>However, while the EU Commissioner responsible for

enlargement and European neighborhood policy, Štefan Füle,

acknowledged that the EU provides support to Morocco for border management, he

emphasized that “<span>there are no fixed annual financial

allocations for migration-related programmes, either for Morocco or any

country.”</span><a href="#_ftn146" name="_ftnref146"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[146]</span></span></span></span></a><span> He also highlighted the EU’s support of local and

international NGOs that work to promote the human rights of migrants in Morocco

and the EU’s engagement in a dialogue with Morocco to improve human

rights in the country.</span><a href="#_ftn147" name="_ftnref147"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[147]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p>
      <span>Nonetheless,

providing support to organizations and projects to improve the situation of

migrants in Morocco does not remove the EU’s responsibility for ensuring

it does not provide support for abusive border management to Moroccan agencies

or practices that violate international human rights law. The EU bodies should assess

whether ENP development-funded migration enforcement is consistent with the

EU’s commitments to human rights. Until Morocco ends the inhuman and

degrading treatment of undocumented migrants and ensures that refugees are

protected, the EU and its member states should refrain from signing any further

readmission agreements with Morocco. EU bodies should investigate the human

rights abuses documented in this report, and ensure that EU financial and programmatic

support to Morocco for legitimate border enforcement and migration management

is not used for unlawful purposes and that EU capacity building is also used to

provide meaningful support for Moroccan government efforts to better protect

refugees and asylum seekers and to promote respect for the human rights of all

migrants.</span>

      <span> But while the CESCR interprets the Covenant as

allowing for “progressive realization” of social and economic

rights based on available resources, it also precludes states from taking

“deliberately retrogressive measures” that would destroy access to

or enjoyment of a core right.</span>

        </span>
      </a>
      <span> The destruction of an existing home, even a makeshift

tent, especially without the provision of equivalent housing, would be such a

retrogressive step.</span>
    </p>
<p>Forced evictions are the most obvious violation of a

government's obligations to ensure everyone's right to shelter. The CESCR

defines forced evictions as, "the permanent or temporary removal against

their will of individuals, families and/or communities from the homes and/or

land which they occupy, without the provision of, and access to, appropriate

forms of legal or other protection."<a href="#_ftn179" name="_ftnref179"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[179]</span></span></span></span></a> It says that forced

evictions constitute "a gross violation of human rights," and are

"incompatible with the require<span>ments of the Covenant

[ICESCR].”</span><a href="#_ftn180" name="_ftnref180"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[180]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p>According to the CESCR, evictions must be carried out

according to the law and respecting international human rights law. The

Committee also determined that due process procedures must be respected in

carrying out forced evictions, and made no distinction on the applicability of

these rights to people depending on their residency status in the country. These

due process measures include:</p>
<blockquote>
      <span>a)<span>     

</span></span>
      <span>an

opportunity for genuine consultation with those affected;</span>
    </blockquote>
<blockquote>
      <span>b)<span>    

</span></span>
      <span>adequate

and reasonable notice for all affected persons prior to the scheduled date of

eviction;</span>
    </blockquote>
<blockquote>
      <span>c)<span>     

</span></span>
      <span>information

on the proposed evictions, and, where applicable, on the alternative purpose

for which the land or housing is to be used, to be made available in reasonable

time to all those affected;</span>

        <span>[181]</span>
      </a>
    </blockquote>
<p>
      <span>The CESCR has also stated

that “Evictions should not result in individuals being rendered homeless

or vulnerable to the violations of other human rights. Where those affected are

unable to provide for themselves, the State party must take all appropriate

measures, to the maximum of its available resources, to ensure that adequate

alternative housing, resettlement or access to productive land, as the case may

be, is available.”</span>
      <a href="#_ftn182" name="_ftnref182">
        <span>[182]</span>
      </a>
      <span> Furthermore, article 15 of the 1990 Migrant Workers

Convention protects the right of all migrants—regardless of their status—not

to be arbitrarily deprived of property.</span>
      <a href="#_ftn183" name="_ftnref183">
        <span class="MsoFootnoteReference">

        </span>
      </a>
      <span> </span>
    </p>
<p>
      <span>Considering that undocumented

migrants have a basic right to housing, Morocco should therefore protect them

from forced evictions carried out without due process requirements, including

in situations where they might be squatting on public or private land.</span>
    </p>
<p>
      <span>In addition to its

obligations pursuant to national law, Morocco has obligations to respect

international human rights law. The committee overseeing CEDAW said in its general

recommendation No. 26 on women migrant workers that state parties “should

take all appropriate measures to ensure non-discrimination and the equal rights

of women migrant workers” and “measures that may be required

include” the </span>
      <span class="MsoCommentReference"><span>“</span>protection of undocumented women migrant workers.”

They stated “the situation of undocumented women needs specific

attention. Regardless of the lack of immigration status of undocumented women

migrant workers, States parties have an obligation to protect their basic human

rights.”</span>
      <span class="MsoFootnoteReference"></span>
      <a href="#_ftn184" name="_ftnref184">
        <span>[184]</span>
      </a>
      <span> The Committee went further to state:</span>
    </p>
<blockquote>
      <span>Undocumented women

migrant workers must have access to legal remedies and justice in cases of risk

to life and of cruel and degrading treatment, or if they…face deprivation

of fulfilment of basic needs, including in times of health emergencies or

pregnancy and maternity…. If they are arrested or detained, the States

parties must ensure that undocumented women migrant workers receive humane

treatment and have access to due process of the law, including through free

legal aid…. If deportation cannot be avoided, States parties need to

treat each case individually, with due consideration to the gender-related

circumstances and risks of human rights violations in the country of origin

(articles 2 (c), (e) and (f)).</span>

<p>
      <span>The Human Rights Committee,

the international expert body that monitors compliance with the ICCPR, stated

in its General Comment No. 15 that while states are entitled to admit or deny

entry of persons, “in certain circumstances an alien may enjoy the

protection of the Covenant even in relation to entry or residence…when

considerations of non-discrimination, prohibition of inhuman treatment and

respect for family life arise.”</span>
      <a href="#_ftn186" name="_ftnref186">
        <span>[186]</span>
      </a>
      <span> Separating women from their children by deporting

them, meets that threshold.</span>
    </p>
<p>
      <span>Moreover

special attention needs to be paid regarding the stage of pregnancy of women

while in custody and with regard to the decision to deport them. As made clear

by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, the CEDAW

treaty monitoring body, when deportation cannot be avoided, “States

parties need to treat each case individually, with due consideration to the

gender-related circumstances.”</span>
      <a href="#_ftn187" name="_ftnref187">
        <span>[187]</span>
      </a>
      <span> This would include, for

example, pregnancy and women who are breastfeeding. Women held in custody by

state authorities must be provided with access to adequate and gender-specific

health care.</span>

        <span> By

prohibiting return only if foreigners can show they “are

threatened,” Law 02-03, art. 29 appears to set a higher standard than the

principle of nonrefoulement in the Refugee Convention, article 33.1, which

prohibits states parties from returning refugees to places where their lives or

freedom “would be threatened.” The Refugee Convention

nonrefoulement standard is future directed, as indicated by a refugee’s

well-founded “fear” that his or her life or freedom “would

be” threatened. The Moroccan government has not provided an official

English translation of Law 02-03. The French version of the law, however,

substitutes the word “foreigner” for “refugee”

(therefore removing the well-founded fear component) and uses the word

“sera” instead of “serait.” To bring Moroccan law into

conformity with the nonrefoulement principle in the Refugee Convention, Law

02-03, art. 29 should be amended to prohibit refoulement. </span>
