Activity Report December 21, 2012 Read in: 
French The following report covers activities undertaken by the EMHRN in 2012. The report is first and foremost an activity report aiming at ensuring transparency and accountability of the EMHRN’s work towards its members and donors. Political reports accounting for EMHRN activities are presented by the Executive Committee (through its President) at EMHRN general assemblies. Evaluations are above all the task of the EMHRN general assembly and of external evaluators. However, the report does compare the 2012 activities with the general and short term objectives set out in EMHRN’s work programmes for the previous years. The report summarises the main points of the work programme and thereafter moves on to a detailed account of the different activities of the EMHRN comparing the outcome with the objectives adopted for 2012.
