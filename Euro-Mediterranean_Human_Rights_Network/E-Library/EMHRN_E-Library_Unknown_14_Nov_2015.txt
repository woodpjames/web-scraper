Arabic Paris/Copenhagen/Brussels/Tunis, 13 november 2015– EuroMed Rights strongly condemns the near- simultaneous attacks killing more than 128 people in Paris on Friday night. The attacks, the worst in Europe since the 2004 Madrid bombings, happened in six different locations targeted almost simultaneously. ‘We are in shock. Sheer horror like the one we have just lived last night intends to destroy free thought and eradicate our universal values,’ declared EuroMed Rights President Michel Tubiana. EuroMed Rights condemns the barbarious acts that have left at least 128 people dead and some 180 wounded. At least 80 are said to be in critical condition. France has declared a state of emergency, imposed border controls and deployed some 1500 troops in the French capital. ‘We extend our deepest condolences to the many families grieving the loss of their loved ones. This despicable attack against a free and independent nation will not deter us from pushing forth with our human rights fuelled ambitions,’ added EuroMed Rights President.
