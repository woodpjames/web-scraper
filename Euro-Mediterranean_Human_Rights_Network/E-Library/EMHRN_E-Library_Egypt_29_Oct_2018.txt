Egypt,
Open Letter,
Shrinking Space for Civil Society October 29, 2018  Joint Letter Brussels, 29 October 2018 Dear Chancellor Merkel, Your upcoming meeting with President Al-Sisi of Egypt provides a crucial opportunity to raise concerns regarding the crackdown on the independent human rights movement in the country, in violation of Egypt’s obligations under its 2014 Constitution and international human rights law. Egypt’s socioeconomic challenges, along with its increasingly repressive measures targeting civil society and human rights defenders play a critical role in the country’s stability. The absence of institutional channels for dissent or holding the government accountable for its human rights violations, along with unfulfilled promises of socio-economic stabilisation, can potentially yield unrest and be contributing factors for migration. EuroMed Rights, Cairo Institute for Human Right Studies (CIHRS), Dignity, IFEX, OMCT and Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy (TIMEP) urge you to raise the following concerns with President Al-Sisi: Repression of civil society organisations and activists, torture, enforced disappearances and extra-judicial killings, Death penalty, Socio-economic rights, Migration and human rights.
