French The following pages describe the work programme of the EMHRN for the next two years. The activities outlined have been developed on the basis of: • recommendations and the current activities of working groups and seminars organised by the EMHRN for its members • funds made available by donors upon request of the EMHRN • the strategy document presented at the General Assembly in Madrid The work programme relates directly to the Strategy documents, outlining the concrete activities that will be undertaken to implement the EMHRN’s strategy. Readers wishing to study the political and human rights analysis behind the work programme are therefore advised to consult the Strategy document. Work Programme 2006-2008
