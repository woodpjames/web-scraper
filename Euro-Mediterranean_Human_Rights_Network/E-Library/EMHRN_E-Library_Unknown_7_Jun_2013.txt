Arabic Deeply concerned about the situation in Syria, EMHRN and CIHRS with support of Syrian Human Rights and Democracy (HRDs), made an oral intervention at the UN Human Rights Council (4/06/2013) on the occasion of the release of the latest COI (Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria) report. Time is of the essence in Syria, especially for women and girls who are continuously exposed to dangers of being tortured, arbitrarily detained, sexually assaulted and kidnapped. This is an emergency call we make on the International Criminal Court for the respect of the international rights of Syrians. Escalating Human Rights violations in Syria, coupled with total inertia by the international community, make it even more pressing that all is done in order to ensure the respect of for basic international rights and the respect for Human Rights.
