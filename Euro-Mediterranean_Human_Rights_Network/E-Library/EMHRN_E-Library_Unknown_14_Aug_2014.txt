Gaza: Condolences to Al Mezan Staff
14 Aug 2014
Gaza Strip,
Impunity/Accountability,
Israel / OPT,
Press Release August 14, 2014 The Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Network (EMHRN) and  FIDH (the International Federation for Human Rights) would like to extend their condolences to the staff of their member organization Al Mezan Center for Human Rights, following the death of Anwar Al Zaaneen, who died from his injuries resulting from an Israeli attack in Beit Hanoun, Gaza on Sunday 10 August 2014. EMHRN and FIDH also express solidarity with Anwar’s family in this time of deep sorrow. Anwar worked at Al Mezan Centre for Human Rights for fourteen years and his work in promoting human dignity and respect for international law has always been highly valuable. His death is one more unfortunate consequence of the indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks on civilians. Over the years, our organizations have strived tirelessly to ensure accountability and redress for victims of such violations. Such a crime, together with any other violations, should be investigated and perpetrators must be held accountable. Our organizations deplore the complacent silence of the EU, its Member States and the international community in the face of recurring grave violations in the Gaza Strip.
