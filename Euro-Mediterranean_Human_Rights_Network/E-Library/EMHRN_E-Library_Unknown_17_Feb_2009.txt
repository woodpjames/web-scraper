Arabic Read the full text here A gender audit is a review of the gender equality situation in an organisation, association, etc. It helps clarifying gaps in gender equality which enables conducting an analysis of root causes at various levels of gender imbalances. A gender audit is a basis for gender mainstreaming. As gender mainstreaming is a process, we can not do everything at the same time and need to prioritize. A gender audit will help us to know what to focus on, what to prioritize as it will show our strong and weak points. The aim of this gender audit is to review the gender equality situation in the Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Network (EMHRN). This will help us:
– clarifying gaps in gender equality;
– identify our weak and strong point in relation to our gender mainstreaming efforts;
– the principle obstacles and ways to overcome them;
– recommendations for how to advance the gender mainstreaming work of the EMHRN.
