Arabic The four country factsheets, respectively on Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Libya, provide an overview of national legislations regulating migration and asylum issues in each country. In doing so, the factsheets identify major legislative gaps in the protection of migrants, refugees and asylum seekers with respect to international conventions to which the countries are party, as well as discrepancies between laws and their application by national authorities. Major developments following the Arab Spring and the recent political changes in the region since 2010 are also taken into account where most relevant (in particular in Tunisia and Libya). Finally, the factsheets takes a look at the role of international organizations and of civil society in assisting migrants and refugees on the ground.
