Shrinking Space for Civil Society November 27, 2017 London, 27 November EuroMed Rights and the Bar Human Rights Committee (BHRC) of England and Wales are publishing a new trial observation report (also available in Arabic) on the case of Egyptian woman human rights defender Aya Hegazy. Ms Aya Hegazy, dual US-Egyptian citizen and founder of the Belady Foundation, a charity helping street children, was held in detention for three years with her husband and six other defendants. They were acquitted of all charges in April this year, yet the reasoned judgment is still pending. The trial observation took place between 11 February 2016 and 16 April 2017. BHRC monitored six of the hearings in the case before the Abdeen District Court in Cairo (Egypt) on behalf of EuroMed Rights. Commenting on the issue, EuroMed Egyptian Rights’ Executive Board member, Moataz El Fegiery, said: “Aya Hegazy’s case is unfortunately not isolated. Many of the issues identified in her trial are not unique to her case but are systemic within the Egyptian criminal justice system. There are very high numbers of individuals who remain in pre-trial detention for excessive periods with conditional release being routinely refused. The rules and practice relating to pre-trial detention and the application procedure for conditional release must be reformed to ensure compliance with human rights and international standards.” Chairwoman of BHRC, Kirsty Brimelow QC, added: “Aya Hegazy, her husband and six other defendants spent 1.081 days in detention prior to acquittal. Whilst this loss of freedom can never be regained, it can inform Egypt as to changes it must make in order to comply with its fair trial obligations to its people.” Read the report and the observers’ recommendations here (also available in Arabic).
