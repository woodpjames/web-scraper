Activity Report November 10, 2000 Read in: 
French On April 12-13, 1999, fifty member representatives of the Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Network met in Stuttgart for the Third General Assembly in order to evaluate the activities of the EMHRN’s first years and to discuss the future development of the Network. They adopted a work programme outlining seven fields of activities: Lobbying the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership (EMP); protection of human rights defenders; and peace and conflict resolution. Furthermore, the participants at the AGM made a series of recommendations for the future work of the EMHRN. These were fed into the report of the Third General Assembly as additional and important guide lines for the work of the executive bodies of the EMHRN. The period covered in this report starts from where the last annual report ended, i.e. March 1999, and leads as far as November 1, 2000. Activity Report 1999-2000
