Israel / OPT,
Press Release December 04, 2017 In December 2017, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) is expected to launch a Database that lists corporate actors that have directly or indirectly enabled, facilitated and profited from the construction and growth of the settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT). EuroMed Rights joins the group of 53 NGOs supporting the Database in their call on OHCHR and Governments to ensure that its framework and working procedures are transparent, and that the elaboration of such procedures is done in consultation with civil society and human rights defenders. EuroMed Rights calls on the International Community to increase support of the Database and constructively engage in its review in order to advance a tool that would assist governments, companies and victims of human rights violations to end abusive and unlawful practices.
