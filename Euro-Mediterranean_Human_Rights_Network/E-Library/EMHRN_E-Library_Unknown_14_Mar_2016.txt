French Ankara/Brussels/Copenhagen/Paris/Tunis, 14 March 2016 – EuroMed Rights strongly condemns the bomb attack in Ankara on Sunday March 13th. The attack targeting civilians left 37 dead and about a hundred injured. EuroMed Rights offers its sincere condolences to the families of those who were killed and hopes that those who were injured get well soon. We call on the Turkish authorities to engage in effective, impartial and transparent investigation into this attack. This suicide bomb attack is the third one targeting the Turkish capital in five months. Indeed, over the past months, the violence has extremely intensified in Turkey. We raise serious concern over human rights violations due to the massive security operations. The fight against terror must not be used as an excuse to undermine democracy and human rights.
