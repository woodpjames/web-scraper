Shrinking Space for Civil Society March 24, 2017 This Thursday 23 March, Aya Hegazy, a dual US-Egyptian citizen and founder of the Belady Foundation, together with six co-defendants, including her husband Mohammed Hassenein, should have known their fate. Yet the ruling has been postponed until April 16 2017. Despite the fact pre-trial detention should only be used in exceptional circumstances, and despite a lack of credible elements to incriminate her, the young woman has been detained nearly 1100 days since May 2014. EuroMed Rights condemns those three years of detention. As revealed by the interim trial observation report, published jointly with the Bar Human Rights Committee of England and Wales and the Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies, multiple violations of international law have been committed during the trial of Aya Hegazy. The report finds that Ms Hegazy’s right to a fair trial, her right to the presumption of innocence, and her ability to mount an effective defence have all been violated, in breach of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the African Charter, and the Egyptian Constitution. The report notes as well that the court has given no explanation for their failure to grant bail, and concludes that Ms Hegazy’s ongoing detention is arbitrary and punitive in nature. Our organisation denounces the systemic failures of the Egyptian criminal justice system, such as the use of cages to hold Aya Hegazy and other defendants in court, which demean the integrity of defendants. This also interferes with the presumption of innocence, and the lack of opportunities for defendants and lawyers to meet in private, restricting their ability to prepare for the trial.
