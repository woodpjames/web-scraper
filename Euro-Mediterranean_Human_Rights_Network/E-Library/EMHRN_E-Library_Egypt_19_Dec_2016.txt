Arabic  Brussels, 20/12/16 – On the occasion of the EU-Arab League ministerial-level dialogue this Tuesday 20 December in Cairo, EuroMed Rights and 15 other associations are addressing a letter to the European authorities and member states, urging them to take immediate measures to address Egypt’s escalating repression and silencing of civil society organisations (NGOs), including prominent Egyptian human rights defenders (HRDs). The 16 NGOs recall the latest episodes of violence against NGOs and HRDs in Egypt; new law on civic associations, unconstitutional travel bans, assets freeze… the harassment against HRDs is stronger than ever. For EuroMed Rights and its partners, the EU and Member States must send a clear message to Egypt to cease these repressive practices. The conclusion of the EU-Egypt Partnership Priorities must depend on Egypt accepting a real commitment in the text to working with civil society in conformity with international human rights law and the Constitution, and providing it the required space to operate.
