French EuroMed Rights is very concerned by the legal proceedings taken against Ms. Helena Maleno. Ms Maleno was called to appear before a Moroccan Court in connection with her activities in support to migrants, following a request from the Spanish authorities to their Moroccan counterparts. Such proceeding is part of the attempt by the Spanish and the Moroccan authorities to criminalise those involved in defending migrants’ rights by libeling them as traffickers. EuroMed Rights denounces these measures aimed to counter solidarity initiatives and support to migrants for the respect of their rights. We call for the charges against Ms. Helena Maleno to be dropped. UPDATE After a first hearing of Ms. Maleno at the Tangier court on 10 January, a new hearing has been scheduled for 31 January. The court requires more documents.
