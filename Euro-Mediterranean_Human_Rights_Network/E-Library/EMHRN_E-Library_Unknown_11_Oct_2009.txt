French The following report covers EMHRN activities in 2009. The report is first and foremost an activity report aiming at ensuring transparency and accountability of the EMHRN’s work towards members and donors. Political reports accounting for EMHRN activities are presented by the Executive Committee (through its President) at the EMHRN General Assemblies. Evaluations are above all the task of the EMHRN general assembly and of external evaluators. However, the report does relate the activities of the EMHRN to the goals set out in its work programme for 2008 and 2009. The report summarises the main points of the work programme and thereafter moves on to a detailed account of the different activities of the EMHRN comparing the outcome with the objectives set out in 2007.
