Kristof (column, Feb. 17): If growing unemployment, disparity and other economic factors could be the main contributors to the freedom movements in Tunisia and Egypt, what could be said about the latest events in Bahrain? It is well known that Bahrain, the strategically located speck of a kingdom in the Persian Gulf, has been liberally providing its citizens all the modern comforts and amenities that could be only a dream for the masses in developing countries. Apparently, all that glitters is not gold, and the people of Bahrain want much more than the material comforts the kingdom’s oil riches have bestowed upon them. The people of Bahrain now want what the regime of the ruling Khalifa family can perhaps never afford to give despite its vast resources: the much-sought basic dignity in freedom through a democracy that is by far the overwhelming dream of almost every person deprived of human dignity and freedom.

Kristof’s Feb. 13 column, “What Egypt Can Teach America,” suggests four lessons to draw from America’s foreign policy mistakes in the Middle East in the past decades. The fourth lesson would appear to be the most important: “Let’s live our values.” Advertisement It’s disgraceful that in the past decades America has tried to force its own way of life on too many countries with different cultures and political systems. Let America try to straighten out its own imperfect democracy and inequitable social order first before it suggests anything to another country. William McIntyreAschaffenburg, Germany, Feb. 15, 2011  To the Editor: Thomas L. Friedman (“Pharaoh Without a Mummy,” column, Feb. 16) has it right when he suggests that the United States government divert $100 million from our yearly contribution to Egypt’s military to build world-class high schools in Egypt. That would be fitting acknowledgment of one of the most profound movements in human history.  Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

Just as the great French Revolution of 1789 finally put to death the notion of the divine right of kings, this revolution of Egypt’s youth has demonstrated for all the world that no government is legitimate that ignores the aspirations of its people. Edward B. ConeNew York, Feb. 16, 2011  To the Editor: “A Tunisian-Egyptian Link That Shook Arab History” (front page, Feb. 14) provided a rare look into the organizing and planning of youth activists in Egypt. We know through our work with human rights advocates around the world that movements like the one in Egypt (Tunisia, Poland and Serbia before it) don’t happen spontaneously. Principles of nonviolence are studied and applied, strategies are debated, and tactics are brainstormed, adapted and tried. Human rights advocates living under oppressive regimes, where the threat of detention and torture is ever present, need more opportunities to learn from one another. The United States can also do more to support nonviolent movements — and those risking their lives — by being a stronger voice and example against torture. We should never resort to torture and cruel treatment again, and we need to take a stronger stand against military allies who use brutal violence against their own citizens.
