Updated: March 2, 2019 @ 10:31 pm WE APPLAUD The Pilot editorial board for its strong statement equating so-called 'enhanced interrogation techniques' with torture. Among the nearly 24,000 torture and war trauma survivors who have received direct healing care from our organization, some suffered the same torture that proponents of its use claim is 'enhanced interrogation.' Torture rehabilitation professionals know from our scientific, medical and clinical expertise that abusive interrogation methods, including waterboarding, beatings and stress positions, constitute torture and cruel treatment. When these methods are used in combination, the severity of the pain escalates. Those who seek to bring back this abuse continue to hide behind the euphemism of 'enhanced interrogation techniques.' We must do all we can to ensure that we never return to official policies of torture and cruel treatment. To start, the Senate Intelligence Committee's 6,000-page study of the CIA's past torture program must be released with as few redactions as possible.
