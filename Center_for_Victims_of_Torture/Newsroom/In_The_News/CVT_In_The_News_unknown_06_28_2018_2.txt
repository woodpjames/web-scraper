Greenwich Free Press (https://greenwichfreepress.com/around-town/indivisible-greenwich-joins-hundreds-of-groups-in-calling-for-june-30-families-belong-together-event-as-part-of-nationwide-day-of-action-109105/) Update: U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal speak at the “Keep families together” event on Saturday June 30 at 11:00am. Residents of Greenwich will gather in front of Town Hall to stand united against the Trump administration’s policy of forcibly separating children from their parents and demand that separated families immediately be reunified. The action’s demands are threefold: • Reunite families now. Permanently end family separation and immediately reunify those that have been separated. • End family detention. Children and families deserve due process, not indefinite imprisonment. Children do not belong in baby cages and internment-­like camps. Family incarceration is not the solution to family separation. • End ‘Zero Tolerance.’ Reverse the Trump administration’s policy that created this crisis and chaos to begin with. Parents should not be criminally prosecuted for doing what all parents do, which is bring their children to safety. This horrible nightmare for families will only end when Trump permanently stops his 100% prosecution policy. Participating organizations in the rapidly growing coalition involved in the day of action include: #VOTEPROCHOICE

Items included toothbrushes, toothpaste, dental floss, deodorant, soap, body wash, and feminine products – all of which are staples for most people in Greenwich. But for many others, these items are not to be taken for granted. View all Around Town Posts → In the next few weeks, a letter is being sent to all registered voters.
