"Our aim is to help young people initiate change within their communities through conversation with both decision makers and those suffering from local issues," Ruwwad Regional Director Samar Dudin told The Jordan Times. Recent reports from local human rights groups have shown that people with disabilities suffer from lack of proper services and need support from the government and civil society.The rural regions are most to suffer from lack of infrastructure to allow these people integrate in the society and become active members, according to human rights activists. Funded by the Government of Canada through Global Affairs Canada, the new project also includes the Centre for Victim of Torture - New Tactics Programme, the Association Marocaine Pour l'Éducation de la Jeunesse-Fes, Centre Tunisien Méditerranéen and the Horus Foundation for Training and Development.
