Marc Thiessen’s Aug. 19 Commentary piece (“Here’s a better definition of ‘torture’”), is a dangerous and irresponsible attempt to defend waterboarding and other torture by shocking the reader with other horrific examples.  Marc Thiessen’s Aug. 19 Commentary piece (“Here’s a better definition of ‘torture’”), is a dangerous and irresponsible attempt to defend waterboarding and other torture by shocking the reader with other horrific examples. Proponents of the Central Intelligence Agency’s torture program continue to show a gross disregard for the medical, scientific, and clinical evidence of the physical and psychological pain caused by the deceitfully labeled “enhanced interrogations.” Waterboarding is a form of slow, controlled drowning tantamount to a mock execution. It causes intolerable pain. Having treated more than 25,000 survivors of torture and war atrocities around the world, we know that waterboarding and other psychological torture are used because they leave no marks. Thiessen reinforces the importance of the Senate report on CIA torture, which will hopefully be released soon and put to rest these shameful arguments.
