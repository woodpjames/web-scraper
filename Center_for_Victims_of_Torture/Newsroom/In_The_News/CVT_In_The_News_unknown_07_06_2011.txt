The Woodrow Wilson Center’s Latin American Program and the Center for Victims of Torture are proud to have co-sponsored the event, “’As Full Rehabilitation as is Possible’: Do Torture Survivors Have a Right to Care?” on what is an important, difficult, and sensitive topic. Each year, the Center for Victims of Torture presents the Eclipse Award to someone who has done outstanding work in the prevention of torture or the healing of its victims.  On June 26, 2011, Dr. Elizabeth Lira from the Centro de Ética at the Universidad Alberto Hurtado in Chile was honored for her extraordinary work healing torture survivors in Chile and around the world. This conference was convened not only bring greater awareness to Dr. Lira’s work on the Chilean reparations committee, but more generally to raise the question about responsibility "for as full a rehabilitation as possible” for victims of torture as established in Article 14 of UN Convention Against Torture.
