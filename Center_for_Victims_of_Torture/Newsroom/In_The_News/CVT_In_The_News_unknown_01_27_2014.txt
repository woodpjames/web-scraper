Supported by Letter To the Editor: Re “State Dept. Learned in November of Photos Said to Show Torture in Syria” (news article, Jan. 23): We believe that providing the International Committee of the Red Cross and the United Nations Commission of Inquiry access to all Syrian detention facilities, operated by both the government and opposition groups, is absolutely essential to ending the torture and other brutality. Additionally, work needs to be done by the international community to ensure that more mental health care is part of the humanitarian response. The psychological pain experienced by Syrian refugees who have endured and fled unspeakable torture and violence in their country is immense. Without mental health care, their symptoms will worsen, leading to chronic depression, anxiety and other debilitating conditions. The lack of such services will also impede survivors’ ability to rebuild their country when that time comes. To help these survivors begin to heal, continuing and increased funding for the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture is critical.
