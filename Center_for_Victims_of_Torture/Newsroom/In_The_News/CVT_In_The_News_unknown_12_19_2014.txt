Ruben Rosario: Medical profession refuses to heal itself of doctor-assisted torture
12/19/2014
OUR PICKS:  Rectal feeding. Waterboarding. Forcing a man to stay awake for more than a week. I would like to grab the folks who deny that this is torture, chief and first among them our former vice president, and have them submit to these so-called “enhanced interrogation techniques.” I know their minds will change, if they haven’t lost them by then. An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind. We are cursed to keep repeating this cycle because revenge and retaliation are very powerful, understandable, easily manipulated human emotions. We should be better than this. We are not there yet. These practices, and not just the recent release of the Senate Intelligence Committee report on the treatment of scores of enemy combatant suspects by the CIA and Defense Department personnel, have torn a hole through our nation’s historic status and reputation as a global champion of human rights. In one of the more ironic accounts in the report’s executive summary, we were demanding that a dictatorship allow international Red Cross officials to enter one of its prisons to investigate allegations of mistreatment. At the same time, we were torturing detainees at a secret CIA prison in that country. Perhaps one of the most disturbing revelations from the report concerns the role of medical professionals complicit in helping to carry out the CIA and Defense Department interrogation campaigns after 9/11. Quite a number either conducted, supervised or gave military and CIA intelligence interrogators the green light to use or continue to use these techniques. Torture has been very good to James Mitchell and Bruce Jesser, the two psychologists who helped design and, in some cases, carried out the CIA interrogation program before it was shut down in 2009. Reports estimate they pocketed $81 million for their handiwork. As Michael Daly, a former NYC newsroom colleague and columnist revealed in a recent report in the Daily Beast, Mitchell and Jesser have done real good for themselves in the home sweet home department at taxpayer expense. Mitchell’s 4,223-square-foot spread in Florida boasts four bathrooms, a three-car garage, a pool, central air-conditioning and a “wooded walkway leading to a lakeside combination dock and gazebo.” Jesser’s $1.5-million crib in the state of Washington is even more luxurious: 6,916 square feet, six bedrooms, eight bathrooms and a spa. Dr. Steven Miles would like to see both men trade these homes in for an 8-by-10 prison cell somewhere. “They clearly committed war crimes,” Miles told me this week. The Twin Cities-born and -bred physician has some standing to make that bold claim. A distinguished professor of medicine and bioethics at the University of Minnesota, he served as the Twin Cities-based American Refugee Committee’s chief medical officer for 45,000 refugees on the Thai-Cambodian border. A board member of the St. Paul-based Center for Victims of Torture, he is considered a global expert on torture and the doctors who engage in it. Four years ago, Miles provided key testimony against Dr. Wouter Basson, a South African physician nicknamed “Dr. Death” who was found guilty of taking part in torture during apartheid. Miles has written a book on doctors who torture and amassed an impressive online database of documents yielded after the Abu Ghraib torture and prison abuse scandal. More importantly, he actually believes and takes to heart the phrase oft-cited in the medical community: “First, do no harm.” The ethics that govern his profession, as he described to me this week, are “more than something that is written on tissue paper and then you toss it and go to work.” But Miles is a realist. The CIA indemnified psychologists Mitchell and Jesser for their work. Secondly, war crime tribunals exclusively target government leaders of repressive regimes that commit genocide or engage in torture as a policy. Thirdly, the American Psychological Association, though calling torture morally reprehensible, has refused to censure  Mitchell or Jesser. The American Medical Association, Miles also argues, has done little other than espouse empty rhetoric denouncing torture in general. Still, he is advocating, as he did in a commentary piece this week in the Guardian, for accountability of some manner. “For torture doctors, waterboarding is a payday with a pension — and zero accountability,” he wrote. “Not so long ago, the United States medical community could stand with and protect brave doctors who were resisting torture around the world. These days, to its shame, the community has sidelined itself in the struggle to protect the torture whistleblowers.” Miles said an abundance of scientific research since World War II has concluded that torture doesn’t work. Indeed, one of the Senate report’s major findings found no evidence that it provided “useful” information that led to derailing terrorist plots. So why did the CIA and the Defense Department go ahead anyway? Miles noted the difference between the rationale for torture and its social function. The former, he explained, is deployed to punish or obtain information. The purpose of the latter, and the one he believes we bought into, “is for revenge and to demonize the enemy.” As a result, he and many others believe we have lost the moral high ground on this issue, flouting the Geneva Convention and other anti-torture treaties and pacts over the years that we chiefly championed in the first place. “The issue is not punishment for punishment’s sake,” Miles said in seeking to hold folks like Mitchell, Jesser and others accountable. “The goal here is to break medicine’s partnership with torture so that doctors who see torture act on that insight to protect people.” He hopes the full report, which includes 6,500 pages and millions of supporting documents still under wraps, will be released and archived in the Library of Congress or available online for the American public to read. “These documents don’t pertain to national security,” he said. “They pertain to national embarrassment. That’s why they have not been let out. “I think that civil society protects itself with transparency,” he added. “We cannot move forward unless we are willing to acknowledge our past.” RubÃ©n Rosario can be reached at 651 -228-5454 or rrosario@ pioneerpress.com.
