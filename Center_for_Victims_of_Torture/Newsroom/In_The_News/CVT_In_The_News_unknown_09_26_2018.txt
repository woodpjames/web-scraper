#FamiliesBelongTogether Corporate Accountability Committee Letter to JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo
09/26/2018
September 26, 2018 Dear Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase, Over the last several months, immigrants who arrived at the U.S. southern border seeking political asylum are locked up on federal prisons, where they are alleged to be suffering from inadequate food, lack of health care and restricted access to fresh air and sunlight. [1] At the Trump Administration’s direction, children have been intentionally separated from their parents and held in detention, [2] immigrants seeking asylum have been incarcerated, [3] and, more recently, allegations have emerged of numerous cases involving federal officials’ verbal, physical and sexual abuse of migrant children within detention facilities. [4] Our nation is in crisis. Due to Donald Trump’s destructive and divisive policies, ICE has expanded its “sweeps” and tripled the number of undocumented immigrants without criminal records it arrests. [5] Women, children, and families are being harmed and human rights abuses are happening in the name of immigration enforcement. This is unacceptable. Policies and practices that put kids in prison alone or with their families threaten who we strive to be as a nation. There can be no business in abuse. We are outraged by your role in financing CoreCivic and GEO Group, two large for-profit prison corporations that are profiting off the pain and separation of families. Private prison companies hold contracts to operate detention centers that are being used to incarcerate adults and families.[6] In November, 2017, approximately 71% of the average daily population in ICE custody were held in privately operated jails.[7] Since ICE was created in 2003, 85 detention centers nationwide have reported a total of 176 deaths. Seventeen facilities have had three or more deaths, including eight at the CoreCivic detention center in Houston and 15 at the CoreCivic-owned Eloy Correctional Center in Arizona. Six have died at the privately owned GEO Group-owned Adelanto Detention Facility since 2011. [8] Two of the private prison industry leaders, CoreCivic and GEO Group, depend on debt financing from banks like yours to conduct their day-to-day business operations, finance new facilities, and acquire smaller companies. An analysis of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings shows that Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase have played a role in financing these debts. [9] In doing so, these companies are complicit in and profiting from mass incarceration and the criminalization of immigration. More than 80 organizations, that represent millions of members, are calling on your company to immediately stop all financing of CoreCivic and GEO Group. We ask you to inform us about the actions your company intends to take on these issues immediately. Please note that we reserve the right to publicly disclose any information you may share with us, as the issue of human rights at the border and in communities across the nation is of great public concern. Finally, we request a personal meeting to discuss our demands and how your company can proactively enact policies to support immigrant families in this moment.
