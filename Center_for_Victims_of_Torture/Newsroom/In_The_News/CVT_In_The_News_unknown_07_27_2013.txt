End indefinite detention now
07/27/2013
Members heard compelling testimony from experts on how Guantanamo undermines the U.S. commitment to the rule of law, weakens national security and runs contrary to our country’s global leadership in upholding international human rights standards.In written testimony, the Center for Victims of Torture (CVT) addressed the human rights implications of indefinite detention of prisoners held at Guantanamo. The continued indefinite detention of individuals at Guantanamo – some of whom have been held over 11 years without being charged or tried – is inconsistent with U.S. treaty obligations and constitutional principles.Indefinite detention is an unlawful practice that rises to the level of cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment in direct violation of U.S. laws and our obligations under international laws, including the UN Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, signed by the United States 25 years ago during President Reagan’s final year in office.Placing prisoners in custody indefinitely without charge or trial has absolutely no place in our laws.

MORE (D-Vt.) said during the hearing, “Countries that champion the rule of law and human rights do not lock away prisoners indefinitely without charge or trial.” View the discussion thread.
