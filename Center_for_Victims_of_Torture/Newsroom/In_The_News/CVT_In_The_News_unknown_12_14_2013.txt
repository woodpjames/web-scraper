One-Year Anniversary of Suppressed Report on CIA Torture
12/14/2013
Jess Remington|Dec. 14, 2013 10:17 am Yesterday marked the 
one year anniversary of the Obama administration's decision to
suppress a 6,000-page report on the CIA's post-9/11 detention and
interrogation policies. On Thursday night, Senate Intelligence
Chair Dianne Feinstein 
announced that portions of the report will be made
public. CIA/Wikimedia CommonsThe report details the living conditions for
every prisoner in CIA custody. According to Senator Feinstein, who
viewed the report last year, it 
reveals crucial information on "the conditions under which
[prisoners] were detained, how they were interrogated, the
intelligence they actually provided and the accuracy — or
inaccuracy — of CIA descriptions about the program to the White
House, Department of Justice, Congress and others." "The report uncovers startling details about the CIA detention
and interrogation program and raises critical questions about
intelligence operations and oversight," Senator Feinstein 
said. "I strongly believe that the creation of long-term,
clandestine 'black sites' and the use of so-called
'enhanced-interrogation techniques' were terrible mistakes. The
majority of the Committee agrees." Sources familiar with the report said it
finds torture an ineffective technique. Additionally, investigators

found "no evidence" that enhanced interrogations played "any
significant role" in the discovery and killing of Osama bin
Laden. The report is based on four years of investigation and six
million CIA documents and cost $40 million to undertake. It
contains 20 findings and conclusions. When the Senate Intelligence Committee voted to adopt the
report's conclusions last year, numerous politicians called for the
documents to be released. However, the Obama administration elected
to 
review the document first to insert comments and
redactions. In that time, 
civil liberties groups and prominent politicians, such as John
McCain, have insisted that the documents be released. In honor of
the one-year anniversary, the Center for Victims of Torture has

assembled a list of 58 notable figures who insist that the
public be able to read the important document. Photo Credit: CIA/Wikimedia Commons  Jess Remington is a fall 2013 intern at Reason.

while ago. It was a loooong shot, but the first one, while he was
standing flat-footed, went right past his shoulder and kicked up a
puff of snow behind him. I wasted a couple more rounds as he was
headed south at full speed. Perhaps that will encourage him to find
someplace else to go. And then, I came in and flipped over to see what Melissa Harris

were, "OMG ACCESS TO GUNZ!" They were too busy demonizing people

coyotes--running around us in a circle in the tall grass. I thought
maybe that would be a problem with them--but they didn't give a
damn about destroying coyote habitat. That's right. Even the Fish and Game people from the great
environmental State of California don't care about coyotes. "Relocating a problem coyote is not an option because it
only moves the problem to someone else’s neighborhood." So says the State of California. http://www.dfg.ca.gov/keepmewild/coyote.html I suppose if they were endangered, there'd be more of a problem,

in CIA custody. This is a report about the CIA. It purports to detail living conditions about
CIA prisoners.

war declaration ever made in history has worked. POW's and enemy
operatives are generally not granted protections as generous as
civilians, particularly in terms of what constitutes assault and/or
battery. That's why the various war time conventions and war crimes
rules were established (and are strictly observed by all of the
countries who aren't engaged in any armed conflict). log in or register to reply PM|12.14.13 @ 8:35PM|# "I strongly believe that the creation of long-term,
clandestine 'black sites' and the use of so-called
'enhanced-interrogation techniques' were terrible mistakes. The
majority of the Committee agrees." Droning American citizens and collecting every piece of data
transmitted over networks anywhere on the planet is all good
though. I guess DiFi's thinking here is that since we gather so
much communication data, we shouldn't have to torture it out of
anybody. log in or register to reply RishJoMo|12.15.13 @ 9:36AM|# Sounds like some serious business to me dude. www.Anon-Go.tk log in or register to reply Tamfang|12.15.13 @ 4:37PM|# How come I constantly hear "one-year anniversary" but never
