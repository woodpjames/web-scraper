Theater Latté Da Names Michelle Woster Managing Director

Instead of selling tickets to their stacked show, local glam rock icons Flipp and friends (Shockers Impaler! Gothic Morticia! Rockers The Magnolias! Charlie Farren!) are doing a free show at The Hook and encouraging donations. It’s a great idea with a great old school lineup of rock, metal, and goth, all for some great causes: Either non-perishable food for area food shelf organizations, unopened toys for Toys for Tots, or sending money to the American Refugee Committee or Center for Victims of Torture. 7 PM. Free, donations encouraged. —Paul Cajun The Hook & Ladder Lounge, 3010 Minnehaha Ave S, MPLS; hookandladder.com December 8, 2017 Events Comments are closed.
