Reliving the Torture
04/12/2013
Supported by Letter To the Editor: Re “Immigrants in Solitary” (editorial, April 2): For many survivors of torture who suffered unimaginable abuse by repressive regimes and whose torture may have occurred while in a confinement setting, the immigration detention experience may lead them to relive their horrid experiences, contributing to further psychological damage. Whenever possible, torture survivors should not be detained. Comprehensive immigration reform should eliminate provisions “mandating” detention; expand humane alternatives to detention programs, including community release programs; and improve due process and review standards to avoid arbitrary or prolonged detention. As immigration reform legislation begins to take shape, Congress and President Obama should not forget deserving torture survivors in need of protection.
