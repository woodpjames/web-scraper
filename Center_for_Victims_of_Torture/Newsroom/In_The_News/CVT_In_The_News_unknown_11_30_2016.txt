Scientists consider what a Trump presidency will mean for research.  Robert Egge is Chief Public Policy Officer of the Alzheimer's Association. “During the primary race, when an Alzheimer's Association advocate asked Mr. Trump his plan he said Alzheimer's would be a 'top priority'. We are looking forward to working with his administration to end Alzheimer's, our nation’s most expensive disease. We are also hopeful, because so many of our leaders in Congress are excited to continue to work in a bipartisan way to advance public policies that will improve the lives of those living with Alzheimer's disease and their caregivers.”
