Letter to the Editor: Let torture report speak for itself

ANALYSIS/OPINION: It is regrettable that The Washington Times chose to include so early on in its article on the Senate Intelligence Committee’s bipartisan and comprehensive CIA Torture Report Jose Rodriguez Jr., one of the most outspoken torture proponents, without also mentioning that Mr. Rodriguez was the CIA official who ordered the destruction of videotapes showing CIA torture (“Senate torture report didn’t interview responsible CIA officers,” Web, Aug. 25). Mr. Rodriguez, for one, should let the facts in the report speak for themselves and show the American people what was done in their name. Also troubling is the article’s grossly inaccurate, euphemistic description of forced-stress positions as “uncomfortable positioning.” Based on our experience extending rehabilitative care to more than 27,000 survivors of torture and war atrocities, we know forced-stress positions, commonly used by repressive regimes, can lead to long-term or even permanent damage, including nerve, joint and circulatory damage and muscle and joint pain. Forced-stress positions are not “uncomfortable.” They can amount to torture and cruelty. Rather than relying on Mr. Rodriguez and Michael Hayden’s recent column criticizing human-rights organizations and others for seeking the truth about CIA torture, The Washington Times should do its readers a great service by joining more than 150 political, national security, foreign policy, military and religious leaders (and nearly 30 editorial boards) who support release of the report.
