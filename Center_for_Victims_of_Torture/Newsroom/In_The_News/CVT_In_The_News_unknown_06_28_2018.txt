TORTURE: IT’S NOT WHO WE ARE – OR IS IT?
06/28/2018
Like many other independent news and media sites, Rise Up Times has noticed a decline in the number of people looking at articles due to censorship by Google and Facebook. Independent journalism has become the last bastion in seeking and telling the truth as government and corporate lies are promoted by the mainstream corporate media. In the name of democratic rights for all please support us now and share articles widely. The people, Yes!
