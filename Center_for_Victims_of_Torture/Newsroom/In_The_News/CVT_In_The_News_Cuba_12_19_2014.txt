Ruben Rosario: For Tony Oliva and Ignacio Herrera, Cuba is personal
12/19/2014
OUR PICKS:  It was about seven years ago that Minnesota Twins great Tony Oliva received news that one of his brothers, Pedro, was seriously ill. Since the mid-1980s, Oliva and other Cuban Americans had been allowed to visit relatives once every year following a temporary lifting of travel restrictions from the U.S. to his homeland. But the policy later was changed to one visit every three years. Oliva found himself out of luck. He was denied permission to see his ailing brother. “I found an alternate way to go, but these are the kinds of things that affect a person,” the 76-year-old local baseball icon told me in Spanish this past week. “Imagine if your mother or father or brother was ill and you were prevented from going to see them?” His brother died two weeks after his visit. Returning for the funeral was out of the question. But Oliva did not want to dwell too much on the past during our chat. He is ecstatic after hearing about President Barack Obama’s decision to normalize relations with the Cuban communist government. Only Congress has the power to lift the trade embargo first put in place in 1960. That will not happen anytime soon, given that both houses will have a Republican majority for at least the next two years. But the presidential action clears the way for a U.S. embassy in Havana, as well as easing of travel and more cultural and educational exchanges. “I am so happy,” said Oliva, who left Cuba 54 years ago to pursue a pro baseball career. “It’s a beautiful thing to now see these two countries doing this. It’s going to help a lot of people on both sides.” Not everyone shares Oliva’s view. The still large and influential Cuban exile community in Miami not surprisingly reacted with anger at the decision. Some denounced Obama as a traitor and the “appeaser in chief.” Florida senator and potential Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants who came here three years before the 1959 Castro revolution, blasted the move. “It is just another concession to a tyranny by the Obama administration rather than a defense of every universal and unalienable right that our country stands for,” Rubio said. “It will significantly set back the hopes of freedom and democracy for the Cuban people.” But that staunch anti-Castro regime fervor is not largely shared by younger Cubans and recent arrivals. According to a Florida International University poll conducted this year, only 48 percent of Miami-Dade County’s Cuban-Americans support continuing the embargo. The figure was 87 percent when the first poll was conducted two decades ago. In the 18-to-29 age group polled, 90 percent favor diplomatic relations. Oliva understands and respects the deep passions. But he doesn’t care much for the politics. He prefers to look at the situation from a human relations perspective. “People have suffered a little and others a lot because of the way this conflict has separated loved ones,” he said. Rosa Garcia-Peltoniemi’s father, the late Pedro Garcia, an oil company executive, was labeled an “undesirable” after the revolution for his resistance to the new regime, and he was sent to a labor camp. He was later allowed to leave for the United States with his daughter and other family members. In spite of his treatment, “my father would be bemused and happy,” said Garcia-Peltoniemi, a psychologist and senior staff clinician at the Center for Victims of Torture in St. Paul. “He was a forgiving man who took a larger view on life,” she added. “I wish he would have seen this. There’s now a certain connection that did not exist before. The hope now is that this will change the environment in how the two countries interact with each other.” There is no doubt that Cuba posed a momentous threat to national security when it agreed to allow the Soviet Union to install nuclear warheads. It brought us to the brink of nuclear war. And there is no doubt the communist regime has been responsible for numerous human rights violations. Its repressive policies prompted many desperate Cubans to flee the island in rafts and boats and brave shark-infested waters to reach this nation. Countless thousands never made it to shore. That’s something that should never be forgotten. But other nations we now trade with and also consider allies have done much worse to us. Germany killed thousands of Americans in two world wars and perpetrated one of the worst acts of genocide in history. Japan attacked us and waged a costly conflict that ended with the atomic bombings of Nagasaki and Hiroshima. In 1972, President Richard Nixon visited and began establishing relations with the communist People’s Republic of China. That nation had or probably still has nuclear warheads aimed at us. It helped North Korean troops and took part in the killing of American soldiers during the Korean War. It is now one of our major trade partners. We have an embassy there. We have another one in Moscow in the former Soviet Union, our Cold War nemesis. More than 47,000 American combat troops were killed and 153,000 wounded during the Vietnam War. In 2007, Congress approved permanent trade relations with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. We have embassies in Hanoi and Saigon. So I ask: If them, then why not Cuba? “I cannot describe how content I feel about this historic moment,” said Ignacio “Nachito” Herrera, a renowned jazz pianist and Cuban immigrant who made Minnesota his home a decade ago. Herrera is dedicating his Jan. 9 performance at the Dakota jazz club in downtown Minneapolis to the thawing of relations. He also plans to pen a personal thank you to Obama on behalf of his foundation, which promotes music exchanges throughout the Americas and sponsored Minnesota musicians and students on a concert festival trip to Havana last year. “It is time already,” he added.
