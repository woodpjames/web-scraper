						3/29/2016 (2 years ago) Published in U.S. Keywords: CIA, detainees, sexual humiliation, torture, 9/11 LOS ANGELES, CA (Catholic Online) - A 2014 report detailed the torture techniques, which included brutal beatings and the use of unnecessary and painful medical techniques. All video evidence of the CIA's torture methods conducted at "black site" prisons were destroyed in 2015, but the photographs remain.  Take the Bible Quiz now! The images reveal bound and blindfolded captives who have visible bruises while others simply show CIA officials, soldiers or contractors standing beside the detainees.  Detainees were photographed naked before being tortured (Supplied). One man, described to have been chained nearly naked to the floor, died from hypothermia; another was forced to hang by his arms for 22 hours.  One unidentified man was pictured in a poncho while attached to wires (News Corp Australia). One Senate investigation conducted in 2014 found CIA officers would "strip a detainee naked, shackle him in the standing position for up to 72 hours, and douse [him] repeatedly with cold water."  Cuffed and filthy, this detainee was subjected to harsh interrogation and torture (Politico). "You can't feed somebody this way. And so, for the U.S. government to claim that this is some sort of feeding technique, that's just totally bizarre," Dr. Miles added.
