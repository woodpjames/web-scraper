Global agenda must include mental health 
10/03/2014
Access to mental health and psychosocial support must be an integral part of the global health agenda [“Newest crisis of the Syrian war: Traumatized children,” World, Sept. 29]. The war in Syria has taken an unspeakable toll on children. We see its debilitating effects at our site in Jordan, where many children refugee survivors are receiving rehabilitative care. Their painful experiences, such as the death of or separation from family members, can have long-term impacts on their development and well-being. These children need basic necessities, counseling and psychosocial support. Global leaders recently convened in Washington to advance the Global Health Security Agenda on infectious diseases. Moving forward, we hope this important initiative will help bring government focus to psychological concerns and make mental health a priority. Prompt action by the international community is vital to stem the horrific tide of more children becoming part of the lost generation of Syrian children.
