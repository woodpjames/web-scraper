Tell Congress: No More Cuts to Refugee Admissions
09/12/2018
From the Center for the Victims of Torture (http://www.cvt.org/): It’s the worst refugee crisis since the Second World War. Brutal violence in places like Syria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, South Sudan and Myanmar drove more than 68 million people from their homes last year, many of them survivors of horrific torture. The Trump administration’s response to the unprecedented scale of this suffering? Callous indifference. At best. After slashing the number of refugees the U.S. would accept this year to 45,000, President Trump is getting ready to tighten the screws even more—with recent reports suggesting he may cut the number of refugees we’ll admit in 2019 all the way down to 25,000. Tell Congress: Don’t turn your back on people fleeing torture and persecution. Dropping below 45,000, which is already the lowest refugee admissions goal in the history of the program, betrays our country’s legacy as a nation of immigrants. It panders to xenophobia at the cruel expense of children, women and men who have endured unimaginable atrocities. And it damages our foreign policy and national security interests. But the Trump administration isn’t just slashing the number of refugees we’ll admit, they’re also deliberately slowing the vetting process—making it highly unlikely that the number of refugees actually resettled will reach even the sharply lower cap set by the President. Americans believe in refugee resettlement. As a nation, we have opened our arms and hearts to refugees throughout our history. Join us. Tell Congress to take action.
