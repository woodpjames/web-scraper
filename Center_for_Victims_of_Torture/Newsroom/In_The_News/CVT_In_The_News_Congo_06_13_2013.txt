Women Healing in Congo

Supported by Letter To the Editor: Re “Therapy for Victims of Sexual Violence Shows Promise in Congo” (news article, June 6): The scale of the suffering experienced by women and girls in the Democratic Republic of Congo can be too vast to grasp, too painful to imagine. By covering the emotional recovery of women and girls affected by sexual violence, you have helped humanize the victims. Your article connects us to Congolese women who survived rape and are pouring their energies into healing. We see the desire and power that these survivors possess to rebuild their lives. You honor these women by shifting our attention to their fight to heal. ELIZABETH A. SEABERRY Hillsboro, Ore., June 7, 2013  The writer is a former staff member of the Center for Victims of Torture.
