First, Do No Harm
 Monday, July 27, 2015 
From across the nation, a group of psychologists, Grad Students Talk: Psychology Graduate Students Invested in Social Justice, are discussing current issues affecting our communities. The group conducts conference calls to discuss events and actions that are relevant in our communities. As a safe place for dialogue and ideas to be considered, Grad Students Talk has recently touched on the topic of torture.A recent report confirmed that leaders in the American Psychological Association colluded with the Department of Defense in its post-9/11 interrogation program. And as psychology students representative of the health profession, the Grad Students Talk group recognizes their first ethical duty is to “do no harm.” The student group has initiated a movement to stand against these injustices. They have asked psychologists to support each other in challenging the APA’s actions and to pledge their duty to fight for human rights.To promote their work, the group is selling t-shirts with the words “First Do No Harm” and are encouraging supporters to wear the shirts on Saturday August 8, 2015 at APA's Annual Convention. The group has pledged to donate $1 for each shirt purchased to The Center for Victims of Torture, to continue advocating against acts of torture.Purchase your shirt online.Read our statements on the APA’s actions.The Center for Victims of Torture Responds to Report of APA Leaders’ Collusion with Department of Defense Interrogation ProgramThe Center for Victims of Torture Outraged at Allegations of APA Collusion With CIA Torture Program
