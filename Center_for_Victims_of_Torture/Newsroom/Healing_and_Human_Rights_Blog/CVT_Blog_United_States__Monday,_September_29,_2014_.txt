 Monday, September 29, 2014 
In early August, we wrote about a group of U.S. Senators urging President Obama to extend for two years Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) for Liberians residing legally in the United States. The current eighteen-month DED extension is set to expire on September 30, 2014.On September 26, 2014, President Obama signed a Presidential Memorandum extending DED for qualified people from Liberia for two years, through October 1, 2016. Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, a leader in efforts to obtain a DED extension, released this statement in response to the President’s positive actions.
