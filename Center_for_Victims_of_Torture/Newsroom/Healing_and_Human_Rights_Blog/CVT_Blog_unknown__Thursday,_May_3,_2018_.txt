Because the physical effects of torture can interfere with even the most basic functions of daily life, many survivors require massage or physical therapy to help alleviate physical symptoms of their torture.A group of seven doctoral physical therapy students from the University of Minnesota with whom Laura has been working during the academic year – Matthew Gehrke, Jessica Hansen, Lily Jilk, Drew Lukes, Karl Meunier, Austin Moore and Leslie Szmanda – planned the physiotherapy event. They chose CVT from a handful of organizations to volunteer with for a clerkship class.“Before I came to CVT, it never occurred to me that commonplace activities and movements can adversely impact a survivor who is receiving care,” one of the students, Drew Lukes, mentioned at the training. “Something as simple as shutting the door can be triggering.” Factoring these considerations into his training helped him acquire a trauma-sensitive approach to care that will be indispensable to his career as he advances.During her presentation, Laura explained that at CVT, therapy is client-driven and guided by health care professionals, who must be careful not to foster dependency in clients. Providers guide clients, teaching them as much as possible so that they know how to decrease their distressing symptoms, and to re-engage in favored activities.A professor from Concordia University was so impressed with the program – which in addition to Laura’s presentation included remarks from CVT’s clinic nurse, Erin Mehta, MS, RN, PHN, and Leora Hudak, MSW, LICSW, psychotherapist with CVT’s St. Paul Healing Center, about the transformational impact of CVT’s physiotherapy work on their clients – that she invited Laura to speak to the University’s physical therapy program next year.The students were pleased with the turnout and their efforts. “I was humbled and honored to a part of something that is such a worthy cause,” said Drew. “I hope to continue to volunteer with CVT in the future once I graduate and become licensed!”- Sabrina Crews, CVT marketing and communications specialist
