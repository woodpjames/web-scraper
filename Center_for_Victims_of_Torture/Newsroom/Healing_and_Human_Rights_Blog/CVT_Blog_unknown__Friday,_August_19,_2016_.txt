World Humanitarian Day: Why Healing Work is Necessary
 Friday, August 19, 2016 
Curt Goering is CVT executive director.In honor of World Humanitarian Day, CVT gives special recognition to humanitarians and our staff across the world who are dedicated to extending rehabilitative care to help survivors of torture rebuild their lives. In the past 30 years, CVT has been on the frontlines bearing witness to the healing journeys of over 30,000 survivors of torture. Our courageous staff has seen the many challenges as well as the profound levels of resilience in the human spirit.During the current global refugee crisis of displaced persons and social and political unrest, I share the sentiments of humanitarian organizations and civil society in the UN’s call to the international community: we must be re-inspired and recommitted to the more than 130 million people around the world who are in need of humanitarian assistance. While there are many reasons that CVT’s healing work matters, here are some key reasons that rehabilitative care should be at the core of humanitarian crisis response:Amid the humanitarian crises of today, we have more work to do. I am proud to acknowledge the brave men and women across the world who are working on the healing journey of thousands who have been impacted by war, violence and destruction. We hope you’ll #ShareHumanity with us by joining the movement to end torture here.#WHD2016
