Syrians Are Largest Refugee Population Under UNHCR Mandate
 Wednesday, January 7, 2015 
The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) today announced that – for the first time – Syrians are now the largest refugee population under its mandate. This finding is part of UNHCR’s Mid-Year Trends 2014 report.This report shows that 5.5 million people – due to war and conflict – became newly displaced during the first six months of 2014. Taking into account several factors, UNHCR says the number of people it helps stood at 46.3 million as of mid-2014. This number is 3.4 million more than at the end of 2013 and is a record high.As of June 2014, there are more than 3 million Syrian refugees. They now account for 23 percent of all refugees being assisted by UNHCR worldwide. The report says the crisis in Syria has resulted in the Middle East and North Africa becoming the regions hosting the largest number of refugees. This represents a shift from Asia and the Pacific. Among the countries with the largest refugee populations are places where CVT works internationally – Jordan (737,000 refugees), Ethiopia (588,000 refugees) and Kenya (537,000 refugees).  According to the report, relative to the size of its population, Jordan is one of two countries hosting the largest number of refugees. Relative to the size of its economy, Ethiopia is one of two countries carrying the greatest economic burden.
