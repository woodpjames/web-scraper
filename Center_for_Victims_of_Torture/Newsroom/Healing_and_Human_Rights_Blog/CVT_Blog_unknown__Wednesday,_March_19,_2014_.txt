 Wednesday, March 19, 2014 
In this commentary, Executive Director Curt Goering describes some of the important reasons why CVT supports the public release of the Senate Intelligence Committee’s 6,300 page report on the Central Intelligence Agency’s former detention and interrogation program. Here’s an excerpt of what Curt has to say:If the United States is to speak with any authority on human rights, our government's action must reflect its rhetoric. That means, in part, that we uphold our legal obligations to fully investigate credible reports of torture committed by our own officials, and make the results public.As always, we welcome your comments.
