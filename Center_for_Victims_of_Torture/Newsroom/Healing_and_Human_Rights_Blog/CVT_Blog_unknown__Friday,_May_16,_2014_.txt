The International Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC), part of the Norwegian Refugee Council, has released its Global Overview 2014 report. The report covers displacement in 2013 and finds that 33.3 million people were internally displaced at the end of 2013 due to armed conflict, violence, and human rights violations in the world.According to IDMC, this number represents a 16 percent increase compared with 2012, and is a record high for the second year running.IDMC reports that 63 percent of all internally displaced people come from five countries: Syria, Colombia, Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Sudan. Syria accounted for 43 percent of new displacements worldwide in 2013. Over 3.5 million people were forced to flee their homes in the region, a 39 percent increase compared with 2012.“We should all be concerned about these numbers and the continuing upwards trend. We have a shared responsibility to act to end this massive suffering. Immediate protection and assistance for the internally displaced is a humanitarian imperative,” said António Guterres, UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
