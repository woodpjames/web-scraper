Attack in Garissa, Kenya
 Thursday, April 2, 2015 
At the Center for Victims of Torture, we are horrified to hear of the attack on Garissa University College in Kenya today. The loss of innocent lives is absolutely devastating. Under these dreadful circumstances, we feel fortunate to report that all CVT employees are safe. Residents of Garissa are family, neighbors, friends and colleagues, and our hearts are with them in their suffering and grief.
