CVT Travels to Geneva for UNHCR Consultations with NGOs
 Monday, June 16, 2014 
This week in Geneva, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees will convene its Annual Consultations with Non-Governmental Organizations. More than 240 national and international NGOs will be represented by over 460 participants to discuss issues, network, and exchange views with UNHCR.The theme of this year’s Consultations is “Women’s Leadership and Participation.” According to UN High Commissioner for Refugees António Guterres, this theme “… provides an opportunity to look at the improvements we still need to make to advance gender equality and the empowerment of women.”We are excited that CVT Director of Client Services Andrea Northwood, Ph.D., L.P., will be attending this year’s Consultations. She will take part in a discussion on “Mental health & psychosocial support: guidance and case examples of integrated programming.” This session will provide an overview of global mental health and psychosocial support guidelines and outline implementation examples from refugee settings in various countries from the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. There will also be time for a conversation and questions about the development and implementation of mental health and psychosocial interventions for refugees, and the links with women’s empowerment and female leadership.We look forward to sharing more from Dr. Northwood’s participation in the Consultations later this week.Update: Read Dr. Northwood's blog post on mental health and psychosocial support published on the Consultations' blog.
