It was with great sadness that CVT learned of the death on Sept. 25 of M. Cherif Bassiouni. Emeritus Professor of Law at DePaul University, Bassiouni was an extraordinary leader in the human rights movement, who dedicated his life to the protection and support of victims of torture and human rights abuses worldwide.Bassiouni and his colleague, Niall McDermot, prepared the first draft of the UN Convention Against Torture – a treaty with the objective to prevent “torture and other acts of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment around the world.” Signed and ratified, the treaty took effect on June 26, 1987 – a day which is now recognized annually as the International Day in Support of Victims of Torture. In addition, Professor Bassiouni was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1999 for his role in creating the International Criminal Court.“At CVT, we consider Professor Bassiouni one of the foremost champions of the rights of victims of torture and war atrocities,” said Curt Goering, CVT executive director. “No one in the human rights field has accomplished more and no one’s influence on the movement has been greater. His legacy will be enduring.  He will be dearly missed.”Professor Bassiouni’s website is located here.
