A Refugee Torture Crisis: Millions of Refugees in the United States Survived Torture
 Friday, June 15, 2018 
Maggie Mabie is an intern for CVT's Washington Office.You may be aware that Wednesday, June 20, is World Refugee Day. You may be less aware that millions of refugees are also survivors of torture—that the world’s refugee crisis is also a torture crisis.Approximations by Craig Higson-Smith, CVT’s director of research, calculate that as many as 1.3 million refugees in the United States are survivors of torture and ill-treatment. And according to the CVT meta-analysis conducted by Craig and his research team, the rate of torture prevalence among refugees in the U.S. was estimated as high as 44% as of 2015.Almost half of refugee torture survivors will experience post-traumatic stress disorder or other mental health crises. Additionally, every refugee living in the U.S. completed an extremely rigorous vetting process before ever reaching the United States. The Center for Victims of Torture, committed to upholding American values and minimizing the risk of re-traumatizing vulnerable populations, works diligently to provide resources and treatment for refugee torture survivors as they rebuild their lives.#StandwithRefugees and support CVT.
