Poll Finds Large Bipartisan Support for Releasing CIA Torture Report
 Wednesday, October 1, 2014 
Today in Washington, DC, The Constitution Project released the results of a national poll finding 69 percent of Americans believe a declassified version of the Senate Intelligence Committee’s report on CIA torture should be released to the public.Among respondents, support for releasing the report is bipartisan, with 71 percent of independents, 69 percent of Democrats, and 67 percent of Republicans saying the report should be made public.This poll is welcome news to CVT. We have consistently advocated for declassifying and releasing the report. Without public knowledge of official policies of torture and cruelty, and an official acknowledgement of them, the door is open to the return of these abuses in the future.The CIA Torture Report was initiated, adopted, and approved by the Intelligence Committee for public release with bipartisan support. Releasing the report also has earned widespread support, including from Vice President Joe Biden; Senator John McCain; over 150 political, national security, foreign policy, military, and religious leaders; and nearly 30 editorial boards.Until the CIA Torture Report is made public, torture proponents use the secrecy that continues to surround the CIA’s past use of torture and cruelty to distort the facts and to rewrite history which denies their own culpability and failures in authorizing and engaging in these acts outside the law and without proper oversight or review.ICYMI: This four-minute video does a great job of providing important information about the CIA Torture Report. We invite you to share with your friends.
