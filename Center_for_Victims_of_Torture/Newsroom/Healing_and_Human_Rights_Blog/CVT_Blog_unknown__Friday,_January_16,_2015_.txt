Honoring Tom Sengupta
 Friday, January 16, 2015 
Today is Tom Sengupta Day in Minneapolis, and we want to share our best wishes and thanks to him. As owner of Schneider’s Drugs, he has filled prescriptions for countless survivors in Minnesota.We profiled Tom in our Storycloth newsletter and last June, we honored him with the Healing Connections Award for his 29+ years of care for survivors. Tom has gone way beyond his trade as a pharmacist when working with CVT clients. He takes extra time with survivors to explain the side effects, benefits and interactions of prescriptions, and has worked within their financial means and insurance situations.He has improved the health of thousands of people and touched the lives of even more. We send him our warmest thanks for all he has done and our best wishes for health and healing.Read more about Tom’s civic and community involvement.Resolution by the Mayor and City Council of MinneapolisMinnPost: The Legend of Tom SenguptaMinneapolis StarTribune: Beloved community leader to say goodbye to his independent drugstore
