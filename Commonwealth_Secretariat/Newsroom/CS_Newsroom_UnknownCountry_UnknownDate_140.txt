Commonwealth Health Ministers Meeting 2015
UnknownDate
The Commonwealth has made significant contributions to global health debates, including the threat of non-communicable diseases, the migration of health workers and maternal and child health. It does this by utilising its unique convening power and networks, and by offering thought leadership and high-level advocacy on issues relevant to its membership. The annual Commonwealth Health Ministers Meeting will take place in Geneva on 17 May 2015 under the theme, ‘Universal health coverage, with an emphasis on ageing and good health’. Health ministers will review case studies and consult health experts from across the Commonwealth to address ways to improve access to quality, affordable healthcare. The meeting will also hear from partners - The Queen Elizabeth Diamond Jubilee Trust on tackling preventable blindness and the team developing the new online Commonwealth health hub, CommonHealth.
