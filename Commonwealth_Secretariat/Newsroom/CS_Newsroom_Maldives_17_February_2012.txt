Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG) Ministerial Mission to Maldives 17-20 February 2012
17 February 2012
We are here following an extraordinary meeting of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG) held by teleconference on 12 February 2012. This is a political mission, designed to enable Ministers to gain a better understanding of the situation in Maldives. The Commonwealth’s response must be informed by a proper understanding of the facts. Over the next couple of days, we will be meeting a range of stakeholders which will enable us to brief CMAG on all relevant aspects of the situation. This mission is seen in the context of the Commonwealth’s long-standing engagement with Maldives and we hope that we can contribute to peace, stability and prosperity in the country. Note to Editors: At the meeting of CMAG on 12 February 2012, the Group agreed to constitute a ministerial mission to visit Maldives “urgently to ascertain the facts surrounding the transfer of power, and to promote adherence to Commonwealth values and principles”. The ministerial mission is being led by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Communications of Trinidad and Tobago, Surujrattan Rambachan. He is accompanied by Dr Dipu Moni, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh, and Dennis Richardson AO, Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Australia
