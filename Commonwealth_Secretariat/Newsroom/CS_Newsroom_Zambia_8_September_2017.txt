Commonwealth Special Envoy Ibrahim Gambari arrives in Zambia
8 September 2017
The Commonwealth Secretary-General’s Special Envoy to Zambia, Prof Ibrahim Gambari, has arrived in Lusaka for a one-week visit. His mission is intended to kick-start an inclusive, time-bound, constructive dialogue that culminates in a roadmap for reform ahead of the 2021 general elections. During this visit, Prof Gambari will meet with State officials, leaders of political parties, representatives of civil society organisations, church leaders, traditional leaders and other national and international stakeholders. The Secretary-General of the Commonwealth, Patricia Scotland, appointed Prof Gambari last month as her Special Envoy after she negotiated a commitment from President Edgar Lungu and the Leader of the main opposition UPND, Hakainde Hichilema, to engage in forward-looking political dialogue to address issues of common interest ahead of future elections in the country.
