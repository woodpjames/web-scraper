Election 2016: The Commonwealth observes Uganda's general election
5 February 2016
On 18 February 2016, voters in Uganda elected their President and Parliament. The elections were observed by a team of Commonwealth election observers, led by former President of Nigeria Olusegun Obasanjo. The observers assessed whether the elections were conducted according to the laws of Uganda and international standards. Since 1980, the Commonwealth has observed more than 130 elections in 36 countries. Commonwealth observers have contributed to the entrenchment of democratic practices globally by offering recommendations for practical action and giving voters confidence that an independent, impartial and public view will be taken on the integrity of an electoral process. Read more Join the converstion online: @commonwealthsec #ugandaelections #commonwealthelections Ugandans cast their votes in 2016 general elections: https://t.co/21nJUWpF63 #ugandadecides #commonwealthelections pic.twitter.com/1Pjsb0CXOR — The Commonwealth (@commonwealthsec) February 18, 2016 #Commonwealth observers are hearing from a range of organisations about preparations for polling day #UgandaDecides pic.twitter.com/2MwT8MVhFo — The Commonwealth (@commonwealthsec) February 14, 2016 A team of independent #Commonwealth experts is observing Uganda's elections. https://t.co/FSRxFGckGT #UgandaDecides pic.twitter.com/dIXNAvzBlJ — The Commonwealth (@commonwealthsec) February 13, 2016 Observers from the #Commonwealth met with Uganda's Electoral Commission yesterday. #UgandaDecides #Uganda2016 pic.twitter.com/T5uPogONqF — The Commonwealth (@commonwealthsec) February 14, 2016
