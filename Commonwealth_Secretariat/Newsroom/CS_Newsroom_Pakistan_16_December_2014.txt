Pakistan school killings: Secretary-General expresses revulsion
16 December 2014
I am appalled by the massacre perpetrated by the Taliban in Peshawar today. On behalf of the Commonwealth I express the revulsion we feel at the terror unleashed on children in a place of learning. We offer our sympathy to all those whose loved ones have been taken from them in this heinous atrocity, or who will suffer from physical and mental trauma as a result of the attack. The support and solidarity of the global Commonwealth family is with the people of Pakistan in their anguish as they come to terms with this enormous tragedy.
