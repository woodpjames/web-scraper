Commonwealth acts enthral at Diamond Jubilee festival
2 May 2012
The Commonwealth Stage was a highlight of the Jubilee Family Festival on 2 June 2012, celebrating HM Queen Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee as Head of the Commonwealth. Acts from across the Commonwealth performed on stage under the Commonwealth theme for 2012: Connecting Cultures, in Hyde Park, London, UK. The Commonwealth Foundation curated the stage, which was compered by BBC Radio 1 DJ, Nihal. Commonwealth acts included: the Jaipur Maharaja Brass Band from India; The Mahotella Queens from South Africa; Harambe Drummers, a London-based all-female group from the Caribbean; Ngâti Rânana - The London Mâori Club; and the London African Gospel Choir. Presented by Sainsburys, hosted by The Royal Parks and organised by promoter Harvey Goldsmith, the Jubilee Family Festival runs from 2 to 3 June 2012 and is expected to attract 50,000 visitors each day. The Diamond Jubilee celebrations continue with the Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant on 3 June 2012. Commonwealth flags will be on display on boats taking part in what is expected to be one of the largest flotillas ever assembled on the river. The Jubilant Commonwealth Choir will sing 13 traditional folk songs drawn from across the Commonwealth on one of the musical barges. A million spectators and more than 1,000 boats are expected. On 4 June a network of over 4,000 beacons will be lit by communities throughout the UK, UK Overseas Territories and the Commonwealth in the Diamond Jubilee Beacons.
