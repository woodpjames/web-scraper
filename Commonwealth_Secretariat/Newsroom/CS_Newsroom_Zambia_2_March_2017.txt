DSG Ojiambo was received in audience by the Vice-President of Zambia, HE Inonge Wina, the Speaker of the National Assembly, Hon Dr Patrick Matibini and the Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs, Hon Vincent Mwale.

The Government and other stakeholders expressed gratitude for the Commonwealth’s support to Zambia, especially in the context of last year’s general elections and the positive contribution made by Professor Ibrahim Gambari in his capacity as the Commonwealth Secretary-General’s envoy on political dialogue. Other areas of discussion and possible collaboration included the areas of social and political cohesion, support to the judiciary and legislative drafting, engagement on the way forward for the Bill of Rights and forced and early child marriage.
