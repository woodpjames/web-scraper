9 May 2014
The chair of the Commonwealth Observer Mission, Nana Akufo-Addo, a former Foreign Minister of Ghana, has told the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) that this fifth democratic election in South Africa is a crucial one. Various international election observer missions are in South Africa monitoring the country's fifth National and Provincial Elections. These missions include those dispatched by the Southern African Development Community, SADeC, the African Union and the Commonwealth. The international election observers are spread across all nine provinces to assess the conduct of the South African electoral process and monitor compliance with international standards.
