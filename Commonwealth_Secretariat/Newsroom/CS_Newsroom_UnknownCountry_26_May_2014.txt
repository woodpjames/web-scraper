Commonwealth Deputy Secretary-General opening remarks: Meeting of Heads of Anti-Corruption Agencies in Commonwealth Africa
26 May 2014
Commonwealth Deputy Secretary-General Deodat Maharaj addressed heads of anti-corruption agencies in Commonwealth Africa meeting to discuss ‘Coordinating the National Anti-Corruption Agenda within the Commonwealth’ in Accra, Ghana. In an extract from his speech delivered on 26 May 2014, Mr Maharaj said: "From a developmental standpoint, effectively addressing corruption will be transformational from both economic and social points of view. Effective institutions and measures to strengthen transparency and accountability can, and will accelerate investment to the region. Moreover, reduced leakages will result in more resources available to be invested in the people of Africa in areas such as health and education." He continued: "Representatives from eighteen Commonwealth Africa nations have joined together to share expertise, innovations and lessons learned in combatting corruption and promoting good governance. This is consistent with the Commonwealth way of providing a platform for countries to learn and share from each other."
