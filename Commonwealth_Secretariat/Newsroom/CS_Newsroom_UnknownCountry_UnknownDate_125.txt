The Commonwealth Youth Forum (CYF) is organised as part of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM). It aims to promote cross-cultural connections and to achieve consensus among youth leaders on the policies required to address the challenges and opportunities facing young people. The 2015 Commonwealth Youth Forum, between 21 and 25 November 2015 at the San Antonio Hotel, in St. Paul's Bay, Malta, is jointly organised by the Commonwealth Youth Council, the Commonwealth Secretariat and the Government of Malta. The Youth Forum's international taskforce, made up of representatives of the Commonwealth Youth Council and the Government of Malta, is youth-led, with young people managing and setting their own agenda, with the following four sub-themes: economic, political, environment and social. The theme for the 2015 Youth Forum is 'Adding Global Value...#WHATNEXT?'
