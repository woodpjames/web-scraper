Maldives Presidential Elections 16 November 2013: Interim Statement
17 November 2013
The 16 November 2013 Maldivian presidential run-off election brings to a successful conclusion what has been a credible, but unnecessarily protracted, electoral process. Commonwealth observers have been in Maldives since 6 November, at the invitation of the Elections Commission, to observe both the 9 November election and the 16 November run-off election. Six observers were present for the 16 November election, deployed in five atolls across Maldives. The observers witnessed the opening, voting, closing and counting of ballots on election day. A Commonwealth Observer Group, constituted by the Secretary-General, was first deployed for the 7 September Presidential Election, which was later annulled by the Supreme Court. Observers were also present for the elections scheduled for 28 September, 19 October and 10 November that were subsequently cancelled. Key findings: The Group is pleased that the Presidential elections have now concluded after what has been a complicated and lengthy process. Commonwealth observers commend the voters for the patience they have shown throughout the election period and their continued determination to exercise their right to vote. The Group notes that the conclusion of the election provides an opportunity for stakeholders to move forward in a conciliatory manner and to build trust and confidence in their democratic institutions. The Observer Group will issue a final report, including recommendations, within the coming weeks.
