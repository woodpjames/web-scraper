Respect the dignity of all human beings
25 February 2014
Spokesperson for Commonwealth Secretary-General Kamalesh Sharma has voiced concern over recent developments in several Commonwealth member states affecting the rights of citizens based on their sexual orientation and gender identity. The Spokesperson reiterated a statement by Mr Sharma from 30 January 2014, calling for Commonwealth values to be upheld. Mr Uku said: “The Commonwealth recognises and respects the dignity of all human beings, irrespective of their sexual orientation. The human rights of all individuals must be respected and protected, without discrimination on any grounds. The richness of our multiple identities as individuals is fundamental to the Commonwealth. “It is important for tolerance, respect and understanding to prevail. These are universal values, relevant to all people across the entire globe, irrespective of ethnicity, culture or geography.”
