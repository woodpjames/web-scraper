Commonwealth partners with BBC, British Council on schools project
13 June 2013
Commonwealth Class, a new collaboration between the three organisations, leading up to the Commonwealth Games Glasgow 2014, gives 7-14 year-olds the opportunity to hold fortnightly worldwide online debates as well as share educational resources. The global initiative is aimed at deepening knowledge of the Commonwealth, and bringing its values into the classroom. The first online debate, which launches today, Thursday, 13 June, is on the subject: “Who or what inspires you to achieve?” and features a report on Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt and his inspirational physical education teacher Lorna Thorpe. Commonwealth Games double medallist and triple Olympian Lee McConnell is urging youngsters to get behind the project. Ms McConnell said: “I’m delighted to be involved in this exciting new project, which gives children the chance to find out more about the Commonwealth and exchange thoughts and ideas throughout the world.” Commonwealth Class aims to energise young people’s learning by bringing together schools and children from across the Commonwealth to learn how to make the most of their place in the Commonwealth and wider world. The programme will enable more than 100,000 schools, 300,000 teachers and 17 million young people across the Commonwealth to access themed learning resources, take part in online exchanges and forums, and work on collaborative projects in cross-Commonwealth teams. Schools can sign up for the project by emailing commonwealthclass@bbc.co.uk or by visiting the website www.bbc.co.uk/commonwealthclass
