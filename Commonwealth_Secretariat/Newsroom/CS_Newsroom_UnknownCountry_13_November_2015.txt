Secretary-General recognised for promoting gender equality
13 November 2015
The Commonwealth Businesswomen’s Network (CBN) has named Kamalesh Sharma 1st Commonwealth Male Champion of Change in recognition of his leadership on gender mainstreaming - which encourages policy makers to consider the impact of legislations, policies and programmes on women. The Secretary-General received the accolade at the Jamaican High Commission in London on 12 November 2015. He expressed his gratitude for the acknowledgement of the Secretariat’s work in “creating opportunities for women in many spheres of social and economic life”. He said: “I have made it a personal priority that in every aspect of our Commonwealth work ‘gender mainstreaming’ should be far more than a slogan. We are committed to achieving practical change that has impact in the lives and livelihoods of women and girls in all our member states.” The award was made in one of nine categories which recognised entrepreneurs and business leaders from across the Commonwealth. Arif Zaman, Executive Director of CBN, described Mr Sharma as “someone who has been a passionate, active and dedicated champion for women, combining advocacy with practical steps”. The CBN also announced the finalists for the Commonwealth Women Entrepreneur of the Year. The winner will be declared at the first ever Women’s Forum, which will take place just before the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Malta from the 22 to 24 November. Amelia Kinahoi-Siamomua, Head of the Commonwealth’s Gender Section, said the Forum “comes at an opportune time to reposition key priorities on gender equality and women’s empowerment for the consideration of Commonwealth leaders.”
