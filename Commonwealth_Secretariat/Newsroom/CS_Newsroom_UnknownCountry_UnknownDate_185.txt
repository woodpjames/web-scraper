Mining On Top: Africa â€“ London Summit 2014
UnknownDate
In an environment where the whole world is competing for the benefits that mining can bring, Africa must ensure that it offers a competitive environment for companies to operate in. Transparent and stable taxation regimes, efficient permitting and licensing processes and skilled and healthy workforces are necessary to be a contender for mining dollars. Naturally investors and miners must also play their part in encouraging local content development and beneficiation, acting responsibly towards the environment and local communities, and ensuring that full, prior and informed consent is agreed at every stage of the mining development cycle. A series of carefully selected speakers will consider these subjects and company presentations highlight the opportunity Africa presents for suppliers, mining companies and investors. The London Summit again brings all constituents to African mining together to promote understanding, and to grapple with the realities of how this can be achieved. The conference organisers have a long association with Africa, advising governments, mining companies, financiers and NGOs, resulting in a deep and thorough understanding of its complex needs, ambitions and potential bottlenecks.
