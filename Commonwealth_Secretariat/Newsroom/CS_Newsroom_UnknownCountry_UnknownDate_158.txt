Youth Work Week 2014

http://vimeo.com/110153173 Youth Work Week is a celebration of the achievements of youth workers and young people. First established in the United Kingdom by the National Youth Agency two decades ago, the Commonwealth Secretariat has since 2012 worked to expand the reach and scope of Youth Work Week across the 53 nations of the Commonwealth. The international theme for Youth Work Week 2014 is ‘Youth Empowerment though Soft Skills’. Soft skills are the competences which enable people to interact effectively and think creatively, such as: team-work, self-confidence and resilience. Last year saw more than a hundred Youth Work Week events take place across the globe including youth forums, employment workshops, conferences, award ceremonies and community events. Katherine Ellis, Director of Youth at the Commonwealth Secretariat, said: “There is an almost global recognition and acceptance that young people and youth issues impact on national development outcomes. "One critical factor that is often overlooked is an appreciation of the important contribution of youth work and youth workers in supporting, engaging and empowering young people to contribute to national development." Commonwealth Youth Worker Awards First launched in 2013, the Commonwealth Youth Worker Awards celebrate the professionals and local heroes who play a pivotal role in the development of young people. The winners of the 2014 awards will be announced during Youth Work Week. The Commonwealth Secretariat will soon unveil a Co-Creating Youth Spaces Facilitation Manual for youth workers. Watch the Commonwealth Youth Programme's video below to find out more. http://vimeo.com/110772683
