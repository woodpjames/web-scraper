29 September 2017
The Commonwealth Secretary-General, The Rt Hon Patricia Scotland QC, has called for peace, unity and non-violence in Cameroon following the recent concerns about the possible escalation of violence in the Southwest and Northwest regions of the country. The Secretary-General is particularly concerned about heightening tensions and fear related to activities planned for 1 October in the above-mentioned regions. The Commonwealth Secretary-General encourages the Government of the Republic of Cameroon and all concerned stakeholders to continue to exercise responsibility and restraint and use peaceful and constructive means to de-escalate the situation. She said, “I appeal to the government and the people of the two Anglophone regions to engage in genuine dialogue, and to put the interest of the nation above all others.” The Secretary-General underscored the Commonwealth’s commitment to the promotion of peace, tolerance and respect for diversity, fundamental principles contained in the Commonwealth Charter. In line with this year’s Commonwealth theme, A Peacebuilding Commonwealth, the Secretary-General wishes to re-affirm the Commonwealth’s readiness to support efforts aimed at peacefully resolving the crisis, including addressing the root causes.
