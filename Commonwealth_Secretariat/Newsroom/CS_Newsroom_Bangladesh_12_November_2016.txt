12 November 2016
The Secretary-General Patricia Scotland was delighted to welcome the newly appointed high commissioner of Bangladesh to London, His Excellency Md. Nazmul Quaunine, to the Secretariat's headquarters. Both Secretary-General Scotland and he discussed the happy relations which exist between Bangladesh and the Commonwealth and how they can continue to work together and fully support one another. Among the topics discussed was the threat of climate change to the Commonwealth's small states and vulnerable countries. Secretary-General Scotland said, "When I go to the high level segment of COP22 climate change conference in Marrakesh next week, I will be highlighting examples of threats posed by this phenomenon to most members of our Commonwealth family. That is why I have been working with experts to enhance measures which promote regenerative development to the benefit of our member states."
