Connecting Cultures in the Commonwealth through music
7 February 2012
Universally considered one of jazz’s greatest horn players, musician Hugh Masekela will be performing at the concert 'Celebrating the Commonwealth' on 10 March 2012 in London, UK, to mark this year’s Commonwealth theme 'Connecting Cultures'. 'Connecting Cultures' celebrates the diversity of the 54-member Commonwealth and recognises the role the association plays in bringing together many different peoples around shared visions and values. Mr Masekela is a South African musician of legendary stature, having been at the heart of South African music for over half a century. An outspoken advocate for civil rights on both sides of the Atlantic, he has spent his career pushing both social and musical boundaries and continues to speak out for his country’s people and their culture. Visit the Commonwealth theme website for information on the theme, news, events, resources, and to share your plans for celebrating this year’s theme. He brings his band back to the UK and London’s Barbican for the first time since his sell-out show at the London Jazz Festival in 2010. Mr Masekela will be supported at the concert by 28-year-old London vocalist Zara McFarlane, a rising star of the British jazz scene of Jamaican heritage. Celebrating the start of Commonwealth Week, 12–16 March, the artists offer a glimpse of the rich culture and creativity the modern Commonwealth has to offer. The concert is produced by Serious in partnership with the Commonwealth Foundation.
