Commonwealth Public Service Ministers Forum to focus on economic growth and job creation
22 October 2012
The gathering will examine ways in which the public sector can create an environment that is conducive to investment with growth led by the private sector. The biennial meeting, being held in India for the first time, will look at ways of improving the delivery of public services in order to meet the changing needs and expectations of citizens. Commonwealth Secretary-General Kamalesh Sharma, who will open the forum, has emphasised the critical role of public administration in achieving national goals such as poverty reduction and inclusive socio-economic development. Fair and efficient public administration lies at the heart of Commonwealth values, with democracy upheld by just and honest government,” said the Secretary-General. “When government is supported by effective public administration, it results in greater financial accountability and acts as a safeguard against corruption. This helps to accelerate poverty reduction, promotes sustainable development and strengthens democracy. The competent exercise of leadership by a professional and non-partisan public service is crucial in advancing Commonwealth goals of democracy and development.” The Secretary-General said the exchange of ideas and experiences from across the Commonwealth will enable participants at the forum to adopt and adapt innovative solutions that have been successful elsewhere and apply them as they seek to implement public service reform in their own national context. The forum will bring together 300 delegates comprising ministers, cabinet secretaries and senior officials from throughout the Commonwealth. Outcomes of their discussions will be presented to the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Sri Lanka next year.
