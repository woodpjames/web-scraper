Commonwealth Women's Forum (CWF)
UnknownDate
Held in the run up to the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) the Commonwealth Women's Forum (CWF) is jointly organised by the Gender Section of the Commonwealth Secretariat and the Government of Malta. The CWF is a brand new forum and will sit alongside the already established Business Forum, Youth Forum and People’s Forum and will discuss the impact women have on their communities, their countries and the rest of the world. The main aim of the Women's Forum is to raise awareness of women’s issues across the Commonwealth and demonstrate how women’s contributions can have a positive impact politically, economically and socially. The theme for the Women's Forum is 'Women Ahead Be All that You Can Be'. This theme provides a strong message regarding the empowerment of women and emphasises the important economic and social role women play in their communities and the countries in which they live.
