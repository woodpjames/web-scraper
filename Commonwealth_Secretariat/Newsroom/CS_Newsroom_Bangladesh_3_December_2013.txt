Commonwealth deploys election assessment team to Bangladesh
3 December 2013
The Commonwealth Secretary-General, Kamalesh Sharma, has sent a pre-election assessment mission to Bangladesh this week, following an invitation from the Chief Elections Commissioner. The mission will consult widely and will evaluate the prevailing conditions and preparations for the forthcoming elections. It will also assess compliance with the standards for democratic elections to which Bangladesh has committed itself. The assessment mission will report to the Secretary-General on its findings, which will form the basis of a decision on whether or not to constitute a Commonwealth election observer mission for the elections that are scheduled to take place in January 2014. Meanwhile, the Secretary-General has also expressed deep concern that protests over arrangements for the forthcoming elections have resulted in deaths and injuries, in addition to disruption and destruction. The Secretary-General recalls that the Commonwealth Charter underlines the fundamental importance of the opportunity for all Commonwealth citizens to shape the societies in which they live through participative democratic processes. The Secretary-General encourages all parties to participate in inclusive and peaceful elections in Bangladesh that can reflect the will of the people. The Commonwealth sent observers to the 2008 elections as well as to previous elections, and the Commonwealth Secretariat continues to offer electoral assistance to all member countries.
