Agreement on healthcare signed with Pacific Community
8 September 2017
An agreement signed today in Apia, Samoa will strengthen cooperation between the Commonwealth Secretariat and the Pacific Community on healthcare. The Memorandum of Understanding was signed by Commonwealth Secretary-General, Patricia Scotland, and the Director General of the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC), Colin Tukuitonga. Both are attending the 48th Pacific Islands Forum in Samoa. “The Commonwealth welcomes the opportunity to work more closely with Pacific regional organisations, such as the SPC, on Pacific priorities. Sharing our expertise in targeted areas, makes very good use of our resources,” said Secretary General Scotland. “There is no doubt about the leadership and commitment that our membership has shown towards the Pacific’s Healthy Islands vision, thanks to the support of partners like the Commonwealth Secretariat,” said SPC’s Colin Tukuitonga. “I am confident we will see rapid progress towards that vision.” The MOU will help member countries achieve universal health coverage and address non-communicable diseases. It links with the Commonwealth’s Pacific 2050 report on sustainable futures, and the Sustainable Development Goals in the Pacific. Both parties will explore opportunities of common interest, by leveraging their resources and networks. Examples may include technical assistance to develop a regional legislative framework. Other areas of cooperation cover policies in the fields of health, sports and education to promote healthy lifestyles in children and young people. There are also opportunities to develop joint funding proposals.
