Commonwealth Law Ministers Meeting
UnknownDate
Law ministers and attorneys-general from all regions of the Commonwealth will meet from 16 to 19 October 2017 in Nassau, The Bahamas, for the Commonwealth Law Ministers Meeting (CLMM). Held triennially, the meeting provides delegates with an opportunity to share best practice and improve collaboration among countries who share a common legal tradition. The Commonwealth Secretariat will also present tools, such as model laws and handbooks, designed, amongst other things, to enhance legislative drafting and law reform skills across the Commonwealth. Ultimately, the aim of the meeting is to help governments to work together to improve access to justice for all Commonwealth citizens. The theme of this year’s meeting, ‘Strengthening the rule of law through technology’, reflects how new technologies have shaped all facets of our world, including law and access to justice. Delegates will discuss responses to new threats such as cybercrime, but also the new opportunities to increase the efficiency of justice systems that technology creates. The CLMM 2017 agenda covers a wide range of topics including rule of law and sustainable development, climate change, countering violent extremism, international humanitarian law, judicial independence, and child, early and forced marriage.
