Commonwealth Deputy Secretary-General to visit The Gambia ahead of November elections
17 October 2011
Commonwealth Deputy Secretary-General Mmasekgoa Masire- Mwamba will visit The Gambia from 18 to 20 October 2011 for consultations ahead of the country’s polls next month. While in Banjul, Mrs Masire-Mwamba will meet senior government officials, leaders of political parties, representatives of civil society, members of the election management body, the media and other stakeholders. “My visit to The Gambia is meant to demonstrate the commitment of the Commonwealth to support democratic processes in member countries,” Mrs Masire-Mwamba said. “Elections lie at the heart of democracy. The conduct of credible and peaceful elections requires the full and unrestricted participation of all the key actors and the electorate. Those vying to represent the people of the country should be permitted to compete on a level playing field. Everyone needs to have the national interest at heart and behave with dignity and responsibility.” The Commonwealth Secretariat has worked with the Government of The Gambia on a number of activities, including support to the judiciary, enterprise development, and tourism and media development.
