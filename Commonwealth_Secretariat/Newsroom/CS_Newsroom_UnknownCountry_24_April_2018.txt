Hub and Spokes Programme - Caribbean Regional Workshop 23-25 April 2018
24 April 2018
Caribbean development partners and beneficiaries of the Hub and Spokes Programme, an aid-for-trade initiative, began a three-day regional planning workshop in Guyana from 23 – 25 April 2018, with appreciation of the programmes tangible impact on the ground. Caribbean Country beneficiaries and advisers will work to develop a new framework that is likely to govern the implementation and management of a successor Programme. The proposed framework will aim to support sustainable and inclusive development through technical assistance and capacity building in international trade. The Hub and Spokes programme is a multi-donor aid-for-trade initiative of the European Union, the ACP (African, Caribbean and Pacific states) Group Secretariat, the Commonwealth Secretariat and the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie (OIF); its current implementation phase in the regions ends in August this year (2018). With the current programme coming to an end, the Regional Planning Meeting proposed that a successor programme should build upon current best practice and incorporate new and emerging trade-related issues into a future work programme. The framework should also be localized into the Caribbean context, to capture and contribute to regional priorities relating to trade and development. A similar workshop was held in Fiji for the Pacific region in March 2018. CARICOM Secretariat press release About the Hub and Spokes Programme
