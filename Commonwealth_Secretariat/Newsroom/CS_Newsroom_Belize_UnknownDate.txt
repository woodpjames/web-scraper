Strengthening the institutional drafting capacity of the Attorney General's Office in Belize
UnknownDate
This project will assist the Government of Belize to deal effectively with legal drafting requirements. The immediate beneficiary will be the Attorney General's Ministry which currently lacks the necessary technical skills and capacity to effectively draft relevant and timely legislation. The ultimate beneficiaries will be the Government and people of Belize where legislation forms an integral part of its governance structure.
