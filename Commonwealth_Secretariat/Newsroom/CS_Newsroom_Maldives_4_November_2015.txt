Commonwealth expresses concern over State of Emergency in Maldives
4 November 2015
Kamalesh Sharma, the Commonwealth Secretary-General, is following events closely in Maldives and has noted with concern the government’s declaration of a 30-day State of Emergency. Maldivian authorities have briefed the Commonwealth Secretariat to explain the Government’s reasons for declaring the State of Emergency. The Commonwealth Spokesperson, Neil Ford, said: “A State of Emergency is rare in any Commonwealth country and should be lifted as soon as possible. It remains critical that fundamental rights and freedoms are protected, including freedom of association and freedom of expression and the media.” Representatives of the wider Commonwealth family have also expressed concerns about the State of Emergency in Maldives. The Commonwealth will remain in contact with the Government of Maldives to support it in advancing the Commonwealth’s fundamental political values.
