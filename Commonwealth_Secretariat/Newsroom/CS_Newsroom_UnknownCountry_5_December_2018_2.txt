Commonwealth Secretary-General hails University of the West Indies’ continuing contribution
5 December 2018
Commonwealth Secretary-General Patricia Scotland has paid tribute to the University of the West Indies (UWI) for its enormous contributions to education and for strengthening the fabric of Commonwealth connections. She was speaking at an event in London, organised by the British Foundation for the UWI, to mark the 70th anniversary of the university. Referring to the university’s motto “a light rising from the West”, the Secretary-General said: “The Commonwealth collectively has reaped and continues to harvest immense benefits from the drawing out by the University of the West Indies’ talent and potential with which the people of our Caribbean nations and territories are endowed.” She continued: “We see alumni at work in the Commonwealth, in the other intergovernmental and accredited organisations of the Commonwealth, and in the professions and technical services of our national, regional and international institutions.” Secretary-General Scotland commended the enduring regional and global contributions that the university has made, particularly by students, who are carrying forward the vision of the founders. The University of West Indies was established in 1948 and it continues to collaborate with the Commonwealth to improve the standard of education. It recently partnered with the Commonwealth Higher Education Consortium for Youth Work to improve access to certified courses in youth work.
