Commonwealth Secretary-General on Bangladesh: "Address differences through purposeful dialogue"
 3 February 2014
Commonwealth Secretariat Spokesperson Richard Uku today said that the Commonwealth continues to follow political developments in Bangladesh closely after its elections on 5 January. He said the Commonwealth stands ready to provide whatever support may be considered helpful in the post-election period.
 
Mr Uku said: “The politically motivated violence and loss of life and injuries in the run-up to the elections was a matter of profound concern, and a threat to the orderly conduct of democratic elections, to which all Commonwealth members are committed. "Attacks on minority communities are particularly reprehensible for a Commonwealth which attaches the greatest importance to respect for diversity and equality. It is encouraging that such incidents have declined. We welcome the recent public statements by leaders of the major political parties that violence and attacks on minorities are unacceptable. These attacks must cease altogether.
 
“The Commonwealth is committed to upholding and promoting democratic culture, including the inalienable right of all citizens to participate in free and fair elections. It is a welcome development that leaders of the major political parties have expressed a readiness to talk, with early and inclusive elections in mind.
 
“The Commonwealth remains ready to support a purposeful dialogue towards a framework for future elections that fully reflects the will of the people and respects the principle of democratic constitutionalism. The Commonwealth is also willing to assist the Election Commission of Bangladesh in further strengthening its functions and effectiveness.”
