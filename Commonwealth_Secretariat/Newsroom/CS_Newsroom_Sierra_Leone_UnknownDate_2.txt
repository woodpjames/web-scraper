The 11 year conflict (1991-2002) in Sierra Leone destroyed much of the government administrative infrastructure and human resources, including the judiciary. The Government has subsequently taken steps to reform and restructure its systems through the implementation of its Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper - a central pillar of which is good governance and the development of the justice sector.

A number of challenges will be addressed, including: By addressing the challenges, this project helped to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the operations of the judicial system. This in turn helped improve the government’s ability to provide access to justice and create an economic environment that is conducive to foreign and domestic direct investment – a key driver of economic growth and development. The beneficiaries of this project were the ministry of justice and people of Sierra Leone. Ultimately the whole country benefitted from a much more effective, efficient and responsive judicial system.
