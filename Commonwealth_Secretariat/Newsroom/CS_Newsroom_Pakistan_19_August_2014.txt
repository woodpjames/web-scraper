Statement on unfolding situation in Pakistan
19 August 2014
Commonwealth Secretary-General Kamalesh Sharma today urged respect for democratic norms and processes in the current situation in Pakistan. The Commonwealth Charter, adopted in 2012 by the governments of all our member states, refers to the responsibility of governments, political parties and civil society for upholding and promoting democratic culture and practices. The Secretary-General hopes that in the coming days all stakeholders will work to ensure that constitutional order and the rule of law is upheld. Pakistan’s historic 2013 transition of power from one civilian government to another was a milestone in the country’s democratic progress. The Secretary-General welcomed that development at the time. Today he underlines the importance of this stable democratic process being consolidated.
