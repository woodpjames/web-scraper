Observer group’s report on Sierra Leone’s elections released
19 October 2018
The Commonwealth Observer Group’s Report on Sierra Leone’s General Elections has been presented to the government, the National Electoral Commission, political parties and other stakeholders in the country. The elections took place on 7 March, with a run-off for president on 31 March. A three-member team travelled to Freetown, the capital, to make the presentations.  They included a specialist in election management, Mandla Mchunu, and two officers from the Commonwealth’s headquarters, Clara Cole and Lindiwe Maleleka. The team participated in a two-day workshop organised by the National Electoral Commission with support from UNDP.  The workshop considered and prioritised recommendations of a range of international and citizen observer missions, initiating a national conversation around the elections and how to improve them. As is Commonwealth practice, the Final Report of the Group was finalised in Sierra Leone prior to the Group’s departure. Read the Final Report here
