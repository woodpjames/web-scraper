Queen unveils new Commonwealth Walkway in London
18 April 2018
The Queen has unveiled a plaque to mark the opening of the Commonwealth Walkway in London. Although it was launched in the gardens of Buckingham Palace in spring sunshine, the panel will be installed outside the Commonwealth Secretariat's London headquarters at Marlborough House. Commonwealth Secretary-General Patricia Scotland said, "I am so proud that we have a Commonwealth Walkway in London. When I was invited to open the Walkway in Canada, it was wonderful to receive the warm support from Banff citizens. Commonwealth Walkways help to create a better understanding of the rich diversity in our family of nations, our 2.4 billion citizens and deepen public awareness of the Commonwealth's identity and achievements" The Walkway will link the Jubilee Walkway and extend along Pall Mall and the Strand. It will pass a number of high commissions before ending at Australia House. The Outdoor Trust says it is creating walkways in 82 Commonwealth nations and territories to 'inspire a healthy and connected family of global friends'. Its chief executive, Jim Walker said, "It means so much because it's a great symbol of how London embraces the Commonwealth. This demonstrates to all the Commonwealth nations and territories how we can join ourselves up through a simple act of walking. We help make countries and cities safer, easier and more inclusive and connecting to the Sustainable Development Goals." The Walkway celebrates the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) which is taking place in London this week.  The Secretary-General, Patricia Scotland, was on-hand for the unveiling. The Outdoor Trust is the successor to the Jubilee Walkway Trust, which developed a 16-mile urban trail through London in 1977 to mark The Queen’s Silver Jubilee.
