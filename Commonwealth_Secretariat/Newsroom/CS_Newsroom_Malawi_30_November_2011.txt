Education of children and young people with Albinism in Malawi
30 November 2011
Children and young people with albinism are doubly vulnerable: they are visually impaired and their striking difference in appearance, looking ‘white’ in a black population, makes them the target of bullying and name-calling. This report presents first-hand evidence from all stakeholders, showing how support at every level of the education system, as well as by the traditional authorities, parents and the community, is required to facilitate their education. The report collates information from teachers, parents and children with albinism to produce a list of guidelines which are inexpensive and easy to implement. It offers recommendations for improving the education of those with albinism via the provision of accurate information and clear guidance from the Ministry of Education cascading down to the level of classroom teachers.
