Secretary General’s concern grows after another deadly Nigerian bombing
23 November 2017
With news that at least 50 people were killed this week when a teenager suicide bomber attacked a mosque, Commonwealth Secretary-General Patricia Scotland has reiterated her concern regarding the continued use of violence by extremist groups in Nigeria. This latest attack comes just days after 14 people were killed in a suicide bombing in the north-eastern city of Maiduguri. Although no group has claimed responsibility for the two attacks, the Islamist militant group Boko Haram has carried out many such atrocities. A spokesperson for the Commonwealth Secretariat said: “We condemn this latest atrocity that has left many innocent people dead, and continue to push forward with our  work to counter violent extremism across the Commonwealth.” The latest blast happened during early morning prayers at the Madina mosque in the Unguwar Shuwa area of Mubi, 200km from the Adamawa state capital, Yola. Some 20,000 people have been killed in Boko Haram's eight-year insurgency. The Commonwealth Secretariat delivers a range of activities and programmes to help member countries prevent the hateful and discordant narratives of violent extremists from gaining traction in any of our communities.  This work includes youth engagement, protection and promotion of human rights and countering violent extremism.
