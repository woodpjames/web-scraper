Commonwealth Health Ministers Meeting 2014
UnknownDate
The Commonwealth has made significant contributions to global health debates, including the threat of non-communicable diseases, the migration of health workers and maternal and child health. It does so by utilising its unique convening power and networks and by offering thought leadership and high-level advocacy on issues relevant to its membership. Similarly, the Commonwealth has an important role to play in adding its voice to the development of health goals after 2015 and in emphasising the critical need for health to be at the centre of the post-2015 global development agenda. This year’s health ministers' meeting on the Commonwealth post-2015 health agenda will focus on strengthening health policies and systems, which reflects the Commonwealth’s strategic direction and priorities for 2014-2018. The 2014 meeting will offer Commonwealth health ministers a last opportunity to engage collectively with the post-2015 agenda, building onto current debates and conclusions. It will be an opportunity for ministers to agree a Commonwealth perspective on the post-2015 agenda, as well as on national and regional perspectives and positions. The meeting will provide delegates with the opportunity to discuss the post-2015 global health development agenda from a Commonwealth perspective as well as the linkages to other health priorities. Ministers will also have an opportunity to share best practice and experiences particularly with regard to health systems strengthening, immunisation, nutrition and anti-microbial resistance and the challenges of addressing these issues in the post-2015 era.
