What do we do about FGM? – Health and Education online discussion
21 July 2016
How health and education policies can end the scourge of female genital mutilation (FGM) will be the big question on the Commonwealth’s Health and Education online hubs this month. Beginning this week, the online discussion examines the deep-rooted causes of the age-old practice, which normally involves partial or total removal of the external female genitals. Despite being illegal in most countries, more than 200 million girls and women today have experienced FGM, and at least three million are at risk, according to UNICEF. It is estimated that, across the globe, a girl is cut every 10 seconds. Over the next month, participants will be invited to share the social and historical reasons for FGM practices in their own countries. The discussion will also explore effective policies to deal with the impact of FGM, and how to educate those who mistakenly believe it to be a positive health intervention. The discussion also features the film Nancy’s One Girl Revolution, which follows the story of a girl who refused to be cut and demanded change in her community. The e-discussion is moderated by Louise Robertson, an independent consultant and campaigner for girls’ and women’s rights. The online hubs are part of a Commonwealth pilot project to support health and education professionals and policymakers through online collaboration.
