Applications open for training course on addressing hate speech
5 October 2017
Applications are now open to join a course in London that builds the capacity of young people to counter hate speech and violent radicalisation. Run by the Commonwealth Secretariat and Council of Europe, the five-day course will empower young leaders and youth workers from across the Commonwealth to develop counter narratives to hate speech and strengthen support for human rights through non-formal education and awareness-raising actions. The course starts in London at the Commonwealth’s headquarters on November 27. The No Hate Speech Movement is a youth campaign of the Council of Europe to promote human rights online, helping to ensure that hate speech is unacceptable.  It also develops youth participation and citizenship on-line, including Internet governance processes. The campaign is running in 44 countries since its launch in 2012. Delegates for next month’s course will include youth leaders, youth workers, educators and government officials who work with young people on peace-building, dialogue or human rights through awareness-raising and educational activities.
