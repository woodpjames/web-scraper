Commonwealth Pacific meeting on governance
1 June 2013
A Pacific regional conference on strengthening good governance for sustainable development will be held in Nuku’alofa, Tonga, from 12 to 14 June 2012. The event, jointly organised by the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC) and the Commonwealth Secretariat, will involve 50 officials from Kiribati, Nauru, Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, Cook Islands and Niue. “The conference will explore practical solutions to improve governance in accordance with the Commonwealth’s core principles and values in order to deliver sustainable political stability and economic growth to the Commonwealth’s smallest member states in the Pacific,” said Max Everest-Phillips, Director of the Governance and Institutional Development Division of the Commonwealth Secretariat. “We will examine issues and challenges and look at case studies of successful initiatives, while also seeking to identify possible pilot projects to strengthen democratic governance in the smallest Pacific island developing states. We look forward to the participation of cabinet and senior ministers, cabinet secretaries and heads of public service, as well as senior officials to share their perspectives and experiences. Officials serving in technical areas such as national audit and public finance management institutions are invited to participate in the conference, as we value their insights.” Dr Jimmie Rodgers, Director-General of SPC, said the workshop “will enhance good governance for Pacific Small Island Developing States, as a prerequisite for sustainable development for their economies, and contribute towards the achievement of the Pacific leaders’ vision for a region that is respected for the quality of governance and the sustainable management of its human and natural resources". Each country’s delegation is expected to present a paper on the progress achieved in national governance and development.  The event will provide the input for a global conference on the smallest of Commonwealth small island states to be held in London, UK, in November 2012 to provide an opportunity for small island states to share their experience of successful improvements in governance and to highlight continuing challenges.
