Commonwealth Secretary-General to visit St Kitts and Nevis
10 May 2013
Thirty two of the Commonwealth’s 54 member countries are categorised as small states. They share similar vulnerabilities such as remoteness, susceptibility to economic and climate-related external shocks, as well as high debt. “The need to raise awareness of the financing and debt challenges facing small and vulnerable economies, and to secure support for solutions at the highest level, is a Commonwealth priority,” the Secretary-General said. “I will be discussing how best the Commonwealth can assist St Kitts and Nevis towards ensuring tangible development outcomes in areas of debt, aid and trade.” The Secretary-General will also brief his hosts on current developments ahead of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, which will be held in Colombo, Sri Lanka.
