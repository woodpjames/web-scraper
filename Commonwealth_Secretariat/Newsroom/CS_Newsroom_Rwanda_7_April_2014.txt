Commonwealth Secretary-General on the International Day of Reflection on the 20th anniversary of the Genocide in Rwanda
7 April 2014
The Commonwealth joins all the people of Rwanda in solemn remembrance of the genocide of 1994 and the horrific events that took place. As we reflect on that terrible time and its aftermath, we acknowledge the courageous ways in which the people of Rwanda have sought to find healing and move forward. Bitter lessons learnt in Rwanda, and in other Commonwealth countries, teach us that hope can be regained through truth and reconciliation. This painful but vital process lays the foundation on which communities that have been torn by armed conflict or political violence can reach healing and begin to build true peace. It is by congruence that we establish the inclusive and democratic societies in which Commonwealth values of respect, understanding, tolerance, and inclusiveness can thrive.
