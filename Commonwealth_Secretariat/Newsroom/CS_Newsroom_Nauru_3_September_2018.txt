Secretary-General to meet Pacific leaders in Nauru
3 September 2018
Commonwealth Secretary-General, Patricia Scotland, is in Nauru to meet leaders and other partners this week at the 49th Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) meeting. She will host a side-event on the Commonwealth Blue Charter, adopted in April 2018 this year by Commonwealth Heads of Government, to promote sustainable ocean development and conservation. The Commonwealth Secretariat also works with Pacific member countries and bodies including PIF Secretariat, the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP), and the Pacific Community (SPC) in areas such as economic governance, trade policy support, including through the Small States Trade Finance Facility, capacity-building, youth employment, climate change, and elections support. Recent work for Pacific island countries includes advice on best practice standards for regulating deep sea mining, the drafting of oceans policy, improving access to climate finance for adaptation and mitigation, and a toolkit on climate change law. The 49th Pacific Islands Forum, 3-6 September 2018, is hosted by Nauru on the theme of ‘Building a strong Pacific – our people, our islands, our will’.
