Action against sexual violence in conflict needed as part of comprehensive approach to end gender based violence
12 June 2014
As the first Global Summit to End Sexual Violence in Conflict draws to a close, Commonwealth Secretary-General Kamalesh Sharma has called for concerted efforts to address sexual violence in conflict as part of a holistic approach to end gender based violence and foster gender equality. The Secretary-General said: "Sexual violence in conflict is a heinous war crime, which has devastating consequences for survivors and communities. It is fuelled by unequal gender relations and discriminatory attitudes, which are deeply entrenched in society and exacerbated by conflict. "Lack of access to justice for victims, and the impunity of perpetrators further entrenches unequal gender relations and perpetuates the violation of the human rights of victims. "Efforts to bring the perpetrators of sexual violence in conflict to justice must be strengthened at national, regional and international levels. This should be done as part of an all-embracing strategy to end gender based violence, further gender equality and promote peace, safety and security. "A comprehensive human rights-based approach should look at ways to strengthen prevention, provide services to victims, educate individuals and communities and empower survivors." Mr Sharma highlighted the Commonwealthâ€™s work in this area, including assistance that the Commonwealth provides countries to fulfil their obligations under international human rights and humanitarian law, and implement their national action plans under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 on women, peace and security. This resolution calls for the promotion of a holistic and multi-sector approach to ending violence and sexual violence in conflict. London, 12 June 2014
