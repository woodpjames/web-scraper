19 January 2012
Mauritius Minister of Education and Human Resources Vasant Bunwaree and Commonwealth Secretary-General Kamalesh Sharma met on Monday, 16 January at Marlborough House to discuss the upcoming Conference of Commonwealth Education Ministers (18CCEM) which takes place in Mauritius in August. Mr Bunwaree said preparations were on target to host the meeting – which is the second largest on the Commonwealth calendar and will attract several hundred delegates. Apart from the main ministerial meeting, there will be four parallel forums: Teachers, Post Secondary and Tertiary Education Leaders, Youth, and Stakeholders. The minister stressed the importance of ICT in classrooms and said that Mauritius had recently been chosen to take the lead for English-speaking countries in an ambitious continent-wide project to digitise schools. “We are changing the mood of classroom learning from the ‘chalk and talk’ way of teaching to a differentiated pedagogy; providing modernised facilities with interactive screens; and promoting the holistic development of the child,” Mr Bunwaree said. 18CCEM takes place on 28-31 August 2012.
