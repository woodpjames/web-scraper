Commonwealth Day 2016: Will you fly a flag for the Commonwealth?
17 February 2016
 The ‘Fly a Flag for the Commonwealth’ initiative was launched on Commonwealth Day in 2014. It provides an opportunity for all those living in the Commonwealth to join together and celebrate the association by flying the Commonwealth flag in a public space. Last year the Commonwealth flag was raised in more than 750 venues across five continents. This year that number is predicted to rise to over 1,000 individual flag-flying ceremonies that will take place on Commonwealth Day, Monday 14 March 2016. Bruno Peek, originator and Pageantmaster of the initiative praised the uptake of ‘Fly a Flag’: "I am delighted the campaign has caught the imagination of those taking part, especially as the initiative is growing in size and stature since I first conceived the event back in 2013. He added: “I would like to involve as many schools throughout the Commonwealth as possible because the youth of the Commonwealth are its future, and the more they learn about the cultures, religions and traditions of others living in this great family of nations, the better.” This year’s Commonwealth theme, ‘An Inclusive Commonwealth’, recognises the richness and diversity of its citizens, and helps to inform events and activities organised by governments, schools, community groups and individuals in celebration of Commonwealth Day. Everyone is encouraged to take part in this multi-cultural event to celebrate diversity and inclusiveness. Fly a flag for the Commonwealth at 10am local time.
