UnknownDate
Heads of 19 anti-corruption agencies in Commonwealth countries in Africa will gather in Nigeria next week for their annual general meeting. The theme for the 8th Commonwealth Conference of Heads of Anti-Corruption Agencies in Africa is ‘Partnering towards assets recovery and its return’. The summit, which takes place between the 14 and 18 May, will be opened by the president of Nigeria, Muhammadu Buhari. Heads will exchange ideas and good practices to tackle corruption in their country. The Commonwealth Secretariat used its convening powers in 2011 to establish the Association of Anti-Corruption Agencies in Commonwealth Africa. In 2013, it set up the Commonwealth Africa Anti-Corruption Centre (CAACC) in partnership with the Botswana government to provide training and knowledge sharing. The Secretariat continues to provide critical, targeted technical assistance and resident experts which expand the knowledge and operational effectiveness of national anti-corruption agencies. These improve their ability to perform and help to not only tackle corruption but recover assets. In turn, they are important in helping to deliver the sustainable development goals.  Secretary-General Patricia Scotland has outlined her vision to fight corruption in the Commonwealth.
