New Commonwealth book for blind and partial-sighted children
14 March 2016
A braille version of a guidebook to help children learn about the Commonwealth is now available to order. The book, titled “Our Story”, introduces children to the rich diversity, values and history of the 53-nation community. Originally designed by Anthony Godber and illustrated by Mark Ruffle the publication includes fun facts and activities for children. The announcement of the new version of the book coincides with Commonwealth Day 2016 celebrations. This year the theme is ‘An Inclusive Commonwealth’ which focuses on the Commonwealth values of tolerance, respect and understanding, as well as equity and fairness. Commonwealth Secretariat Communications Officer Natricia Duncan said the publication is part of the organisation’s drive to make resources accessible to all. “Publishing the braille version of this book is very timely as our focus this year is on the inclusiveness of the Commonwealth. We are constantly looking for ways to ensure we are connecting with all our audiences, and making this book available to the blind and partially sighted is a step in the right direction,” she said.
