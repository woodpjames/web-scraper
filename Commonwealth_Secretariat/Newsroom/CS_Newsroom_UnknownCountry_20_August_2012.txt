Professor Stiglitz to speak at Commonwealth round table on Aid for Trade
20 August 2012
Professor Stiglitz, a former senior vice president and chief economist at the World Bank, is known for his work on globalisation and free trade. He will speak on the theme “Right to Trade.” Aid for trade is the financial and technical assistance to developing countries to enhance their ability to produce goods and services to supply markets and participate fully in global trade. The discussion will take place from 2:30 to 5:30pm at the Commonwealth Secretariat in Marlborough House, London. It is expected to draw trade negotiators, policy experts, academics and others interested in the subject. Dr Cyrus Rustomjee, Director of Economic Affairs at the Commonwealth Secretariat, says that over the past several years, the Commonwealth Secretariat has undertaken various analytical and policy studies with the objective of helping the poorest and most vulnerable economies secure more aid for trade resources. Dr Rustomjee says that the roundtable is one of the ways of sharing and disseminating recent development in the area of aid for trade. Professor Stligltz will make an assessment of aid for trade, raising the question of whether the coming together of aid and trade has made aid more effective. He will also outline an alternative path for existing aid for trade mechanisms to promote effective trading capacities in the least developed countries. The round table is expected to trigger a policy debate on how to make aid for trade more effective and pro-development. Journalists are welcome to register to attend and cover the round table.
