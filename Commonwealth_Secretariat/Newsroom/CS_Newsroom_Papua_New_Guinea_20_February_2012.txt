The Commonwealth Secretariat will convene a seminar for Papua New Guinea judges from 23-24 February 2012 on judicial independence and ethics. Commonwealth Secretary-General Kamalesh Sharma said: “I am pleased that the Commonwealth is able to support the judges of Papua New Guinea in ensuring they conduct their important roles in accordance with fundamental Commonwealth values, notably the Commonwealth (Latimer House) Principles on the Three Branches of Government.” The seminar is being conducted in collaboration with the Papua New Guinea Centre for Judicial Excellence, the National and Supreme Court of Papua New Guinea and the Commonwealth Magistrates’ and Judges’ Association (CMJA). It is part of ongoing co-operation between the Commonwealth and the Papua New Guinea judiciary under way since 2010.
