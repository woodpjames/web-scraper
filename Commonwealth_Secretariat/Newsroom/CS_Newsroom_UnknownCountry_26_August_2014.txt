Nominations are closing soon (30th August)  the Commonwealth Youth Worker Awards 2014, which recognise the excellence of youth workers and their enduring positive impact on young people and local communities. First launched by the Commonwealth Youth Programme in 2013, the awards scheme is aimed at recognising and celebrating outstanding youth workers from across the 53 countries of the Commonwealth and overseas territories. Awards will be presented during Youth Work Week in November 2014. Katherine Ellis, Youth Affairs Director for the Commonwealth Secretariat, stated: “Youth workers make an enormous contribution to national development, engaging, developing and empowering young adults and older adolescents. They inspire and motivate these young people, building their skills and confidence to succeed. “The Commonwealth Youth Worker Awards celebrate the outstanding achievements of those at the cutting edge of youth work. The international recognition that flows from these awards allows the winners to act as champions for their profession and inspire many others who work with young people.” Entries close on 30 August 2014, after which a total of 16 finalists will be shortlisted from four Commonwealth regions: Africa and Europe, Asia, Americas and Caribbean, and Pacific. A winner will be selected from each region, and invited to a presentation at the House of Commons, London, United Kingdom, during Youth Work Week in early November 2014. - See more at: http://thecommonwealth.org/node/4654#sthash.peZYjS9y.dpuf
