Commonwealth Secretary-General named 2019 Champion for women’s empowerment
8 February 2019
WEConnect International will recognise Commonwealth Secretary-General Patricia Scotland’s global leadership on women’s equality and empowerment with the 2019 Distinguished Champion Award on 1 April 2019. The Secretary-General will receive the accolade at the WEConnect Gala and Awards Ceremony in Washington D.C. in the presence of corporate representatives, thought leaders and Commonwealth ambassadors to the United States. The title is bestowed annually to a person or organisation in recognition of significant contributions to women’s economic empowerment. Previous recipients include the World Bank Group. The award recognises the Secretary-General’s commitment to making gender mainstreaming a core element of the Commonwealth’s programme work and urging bold action to close the persistent economic gender gap between men and women around the world. The citation further notes her dedication to making women’s economic empowerment an urgent priority for Commonwealth member countries through initiatives such as a tool to estimate the economic cost of violence against women and girls. This programme examines how the direct cost of violence, such as loss of income, can lead to a much larger impact on the economy. Patricia Scotland, the first woman to hold the post of Secretary-General of the Commonwealth, will also share how she is supporting women’s rights and aspirations through legislations, policies and programmes in the member countries. WEConnect International, a non-profit organisation, is committed to connecting women-led businesses to boost marketing opportunities and to recognise those who champion women’s economic empowerment.
