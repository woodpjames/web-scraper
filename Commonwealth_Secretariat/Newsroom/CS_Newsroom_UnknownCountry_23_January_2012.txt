Commonwealth theme for 2012 goes live
23 January 2012
The 2012 Commonwealth theme ‘Connecting Cultures’ has been launched online with a new website: http://www.commonwealththeme.org/ The website features news and information about the theme, which runs throughout the year and will be marked across the Commonwealth’s 54  member countries. It also highlights special events around Commonwealth Day, Monday, 12 March 2012, when HM Queen Elizabeth II will attend a multi-faith commemorative service at Westminster Abbey in London. Governments, schools, organisations and clubs are encouraged to use the site for resources and can contribute to it by sending photographs and short descriptions of their own events as well as other Commonwealth festivities linked to the theme. Various Commonwealth organisations are running competitions open to the public, which can be accessed via the website. Commonwealth Secretary-General Kamalesh Sharma said: “This year’s theme celebrates the Commonwealth’s diversity and its role in bringing together many different peoples on the basis of shared values and vision, the capacity for connecting is what brings such vitality and vibrancy to our Commonwealth family. “Culture is also about the artistic and social expression of peoples’ identity. This dynamic theme recognises that aspect and the extraordinary contribution Commonwealth citizens have made to global excellence in the arts, culture, media and sport.” Visit the website http://www.commonwealththeme.org/  for information on the theme, news, events and resources and to share your plans for celebrating this year’s theme.
