Commonwealth Secretary-General Kamalesh Sharma addresses Commonwealth Prime Ministers and ministers gathered in St Lucia to discuss ‘Building Resilience in Small States’ at the Third Global Biennial Conference on Small States. In an extract from his speech delivered on 26 March 2014, Mr Sharma said: "The target date for the Millenium Development Goals will soon be upon us – and so it is time to take stock of progress made and lessons learned. For the future, the international community is looking to shape the post-2015 development agenda. We must ensure that these and other global processes, as well as international systems and institutions, are more responsive to the needs of small and vulnerable states."
