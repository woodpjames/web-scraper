Commonwealth Education Ministers Action Group meeting
UnknownDate
On  21 and 22 January 2016 various Education Ministers from across the Commonwealth will gather in London for the first Education Ministers Action Group (EMAG) meeting. The EMAG was formed as an output from the 19th Conference of Commonwealth Education Ministers (CCEM) in The Bahamas, June 2015. The purpose of the EMAG is to drive delivery of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for education in Commonwealth countries, and to provide strategic direction, advice and oversight in organising and following up on actions from ministerial meetings. Following the successful precedent of the Ministerial Working Group (Commonwealth Ministerial Working Group on the Post-2015 Development Framework for Education), formed at the 18th CCEM, ministers at the 19th CCEM asked the Secretariat to establish the EMAG to "ensure momentum and continued action" on the points agreed at the meeting and presented as the Nassau Declaration. EMAG will act as a body, with the collective strength of the Commonwealth for ministers, to advocate for the SDGs within their countries and regions.
