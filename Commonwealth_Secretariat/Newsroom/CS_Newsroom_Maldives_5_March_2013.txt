Commonwealth Secretariat Spokesperson's statement on Maldives
5 March 2013
“We are aware of the arrest of former President Nasheed and his detention in Dhoonidhoo prison, pending a court hearing scheduled for Wednesday 6 March in relation to charges against him. We have noted also that Mr Nasheed has been afforded access to his legal counsel and family. It is the Secretary-General’s expectation that Mr Nasheed’s due process rights including the right to a fair trial will be safeguarded. “The Secretary-General is confident that Mr Nasheed will be accorded the treatment befitting a former head of government while in police custody.” In further comments, the Spokesperson expressed concern at reports of tension and unrest on the streets of Malé following Mr Nasheed’s arrest, and called for the exercise of restraint by all concerned. The Spokesperson also recalled that the Secretary-General had, in earlier statements this year, underlined publicly the importance for democracy and lasting national reconciliation in Maldives that this year’s elections be credible and inclusive, in which the chosen candidates of political parties are able to contest freely on a level-playing field.
