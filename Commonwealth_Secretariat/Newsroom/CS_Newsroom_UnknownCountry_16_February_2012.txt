My Culture
16 February 2012
In 2012 the Commonwealth’s theme is 'Connecting Cultures' and we want you to be part of it! Send in photos, video, audio or stories showing your culture and we’ll feature a selection on the Connecting Cultures website and our Commonwealth Secretariat website and Facebook page. Visit the Connecting Cultures website for information on the theme, news, events and resources and to share your plans for celebrating this year’s theme. Tell us how you celebrate your country’s national day through discussion topics on our Facebook page. Our Twitter hashtag is #connectingcultures 'Connecting Cultures' celebrates the diversity of the Commonwealth and its role in bringing together many different peoples on the basis of shared visions and values. Through your photos, videos, and stories the Secretariat hopes to showcase the rich tapestry of cultures woven together to create our Commonwealth. Aged 30 or under? For posterity why not also add your submissions to the Royal Commonwealth Society's Young Commonwealth Competitions through the Jubilee Time Capsule. Each month we’ll focus on a new topic and how your culture is expressed through it: dance, fashion, music, art, etc. This month we want to hear about your traditional cultural foods. What do you cook, eat, or share with family and friends? How do they represent your culture? How have they changed over the years? What has influenced them? Share a recipe, describe any rituals and traditions around sharing a meal, or discuss the local ingredients used in preparing a traditional meal. Details on how to take part can be found here
