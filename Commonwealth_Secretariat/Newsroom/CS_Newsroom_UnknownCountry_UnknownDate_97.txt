UnknownDate
 Between 10-12 May 2016, an international seminar, co-hosted by UNCTAD, the Commonwealth Secretariat and the International Oceans Institute, will take place in Geneva, Switzerland. The objective of the seminar is to: Trade in marine products and services can create opportunities for economic growth, export diversification and new investments. Major trade sectors where opportunities already exist or could be expanded in the near future include sustainable fishing and aquaculture, sustainable and resilient marine transport and logistic services, and in links with maritime and coastal tourism. The Commonwealth is leading the way in helping member countries unlock the value of the blue economy by promoting ocean governance. Our work includes developing high-value marine sector jobs in Seychelles, supporting Vanuatu on blue carbon and climate regulations, and helping St Vincent and the Grenadines and the Bahamas create national ocean policies. We are also advising Mauritius on enabling offshore exploration while ensuring the conservation of marine species.
