Commonwealth Spokesperson condemns terrorist attacks in Nigeria
25 February 2014
The Spokesperson for the Commonwealth Secretary-General, Richard Uku, has condemned the latest terrorist attacks on innocent people in the states of Borno and Yobe in Nigeria. This follows violent attacks on 15 and 19 February, and most recently today, when terrorists brutally attacked and killed students of the Federal Government College, Buni Yadi, in their sleep. In a statement issued from the Commonwealth Secretariat in London, Mr Uku said: “We deplore these heinous attacks in the strongest terms. Clearly, the perpetrators of these cowardly crimes have no regard for the sanctity of human life. The people of the Commonwealth are as one in championing the sanctity of life, and in seeking peace, stability and security in their homes and lives. “We extend our deepest condolences to the bereaved families, and our solidarity and support to the Government and people of Nigeria as the country grieves over these tragedies. “Terrorism has no place in our societies. There is no justification for it. As a worldwide community of peoples and governments, we also emphasise the need for moderation and religious freedom. We remain committed to mutual respect for one another, to the right of all individuals to shape the societies in which they live, and to promoting the resolution of differences by peaceful means.” ENDS
