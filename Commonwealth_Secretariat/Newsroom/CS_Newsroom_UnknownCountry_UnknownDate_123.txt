The CBF is the major business event in the Commonwealth calendar and brings together Heads of Government, Ministers and top business leaders from around the globe. The CBF also serves as a platform for Commonwealth nations to showcase investment opportunities to the global business community. The theme for the Business Forum is 'Adding Global Value - Creating a More Prosperous Commonwealth'. This theme reflects the main CHOGM theme of 'The Commonwealth - Adding Global Value' and provides a business perspective on how the Commonwealth can provide practical and tangible support to governments and the private sector to help create prosperity and sustainable economic development across the Commonwealth.
