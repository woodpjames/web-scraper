Commonwealth congratulates new African Union Commission Chair
18 July 2012
Commonwealth Secretary-General Kamalesh Sharma has congratulated Dr Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma of South Africa on her recent election as Chairperson of the African Union. In a letter to the new Chair, Mr Sharma said that the honour was a tribute to Dr Dlamini-Zuma’s diplomatic and political acumen and experience, most notably as Foreign Minister of South Africa for many years. The Commonwealth and the African Union have enjoyed a close working relationship, underpinned by a 2007 memorandum of understanding to collaborate on shared objectives and to promote the political, economic and social progress of member states in Africa and the continent as a whole. While conveying his best wishes for all success during her tenure, Mr Sharma said he was confident that under Dr Dlamini-Zuma’s leadership, this engagement between the Commonwealth and the African Union would deepen to better the lives of the people in Africa and to meet their aspirations.
