Virtual school assembly for Commonwealth Day
12 March 2018
Students aged 7 to 14  today made their voices heard by joining a virtual school assembly, designed to promote their understanding of the Commonwealth and to help them develop their public speaking skills. The assembly also celebrated Commonwealth Day and focused on this year's theme, 'Towards a Common Future.' The event at the British Council in London was part of Commonwealth Class, a Commonwealth initiative to celebrate the values of the Commonwealth and connect schools and young people across its 53 member countries on joint learning programmes. Today’s assembly created a virtual link between students in the United Kingdom and schools from across the Commonwealth.  The UK students shared tips and strategies to engage pupils in discussion, while young people watching virtually were  invited to contribute their thoughts and ideas. Students shared the issues that are most important for young people in their schools and communities. These issues may then be shared with leaders ahead of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting next month. The live event ran from 10.00 to 11.00 GMT today and was webcast to educational institutions across the UK and other Commonwealth member countries, as well as non-member countries including Poland, China, Russia and Indonesia. Vicky Gough, British Council schools and education expert, said the Council “is pleased to be celebrating Commonwealth Day and its theme ‘Towards a Common Future’ with a school assembly led by inspirational pupils from the UK and involving schools from all over the Commonwealth.” She added: “This event highlights the importance of teaching Commonwealth values such as democracy and equality at an early age.”
