Exploring Emerging Trade Issues for small developing countries - the Commonwealth leading the way
13 September 2017
With international trade as a main focus for Commonwealth co-operation, a new publication by the Commonwealth Secretariat explores a range of issues that are coming to the fore in discussions among policy-makers and trade negotiators which is influencing global trade. Emerging Trade Issues for Small Developing Countries – Scrutinising the Horizon with contributions from leading international trade experts, practitioners and researchers offers insights and guidance on contemporary trade issues such as: the fragmentation of global value chains (GVCs), the digitisation of trade, climate change, the rise of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) and geopolitical changes like Brexit. The book’s aim is to examine these issues objectively from a policy angle while highlighting potential opportunities and challenges for small developing countries. Commonwealth Secretary General Patricia Scotland, who penned the foreword of the publication, said: “The research and the policy guidance drawn together in these pages, together with critical reflection in the economic and geopolitical forces, suggest that Commonwealth links and collaboration are likely to be major influences in the future trading arrangements for our member countries.” This book is highly pertinent as the issues covered are relevant to a significant number of Commonwealth countries that are small states and least developed countries located in disadvantaged regions. The publication will likely help these countries participate effectively in the international discourse on these issues. Emerging Trade Issues for Small Developing Countries – Scrutinising the Horizon, edited by Teddy Soobramanien and Leah Worrall, is published by the Commonwealth Secretariat. Read the publication
