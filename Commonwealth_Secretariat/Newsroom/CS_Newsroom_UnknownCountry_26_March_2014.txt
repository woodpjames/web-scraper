26 March 2014
St Lucia Prime Minister Dr Kenny Anthony addressed ministers from the Commonwealth and beyond, meeting to discuss 'Building Resilience in Small States' at the Third Global Biennial Conference on Small States in St Lucia. In an extract from his speech delivered on 25 March 2014, Prime Minister Anthony said: "Within this Commonwealth, small states can believe that they are truly being listened to, and that their message is being amplified towards the larger regions and blocs of the world. "And so, we small states and the SIDs must salute the Commonwealth for its hard and continuing work, as it networks for and on behalf of all small states, even those that are not its members!"
