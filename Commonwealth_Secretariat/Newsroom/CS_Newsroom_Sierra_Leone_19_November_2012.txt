Sierra Leone National and Local Council Elections 2012: Interim Statement
19 November 2012
In spite of the shortcomings noted here, our overall conclusion is that the organisation and conduct of these elections has met international standards and benchmarks for free and transparent multi-party elections. Following an invitation from the Government of Sierra Leone, Commonwealth Secretary-General, Kamalesh Sharma, constituted an Observer Group, which has been present in the country since 11 November. I am honoured to have served as Chair of the Group. During our time here, we have met the National Electoral Commission, representatives of political parties, civil society, media, the police, the diplomatic community as well as other national and international observers. Commonwealth teams were based in Bo, Bombali, Kenema and Kono as well as in the capital, Freetown. Our teams observed the voting, counting, and continue to follow the tabulation. We also met with electoral officials, the security services, observers and other stakeholders at District level. The Group was tasked with observing the election period, including the results process. We will issue a Final Report with conclusions and recommendations at a later stage. Our presence during these elections reaffirms the Commonwealth’s long-standing engagement with Sierra Leone.
The Commonwealth Observer Group carried out its duties in accordance with the standards expressed in the Declaration of Principles for International Election Observers and the Code of Conduct for International Election Observers. The 17 November 2012 elections in Sierra Leone were the third conducted since 2002 and the first elections Sierra Leone has organised itself. They were also the first time that four elections were conducted simultaneously and a new Voters’ Register was introduced by the National Electoral Commission, capturing biometric data.
