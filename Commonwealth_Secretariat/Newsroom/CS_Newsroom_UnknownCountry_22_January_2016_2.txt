Education Hub discusses the changing patterns in boys' educational achievement
22 January 2016
The Commonwealth Secretariat, in partnership with the United Nations Girls Education Initiative (UNGEI) has today launched a new online discussion on ‘The Changing Patterns in Boys' Educational Achievement: What Can We Do To Make Things Better?’ Gender disparity in education has typically been experienced as disadvantaging girls. However, research over the last ten years has highlighted a growing trend in the underachievement of boys, both in terms of participation and performance. This topical discussion, hosted on the Commonwealth Education Hub, hopes to engage the education, gender and development communities across the Commonwealth in exploring this growing trend. It will also encourage debate on how the educational interests and requirements of boys and male adolescents can be better addressed by the education system. To join the discussion, which will run from Monday 25 January until 19 February 2016, please visit the Education Hub and join the Community of Practice or alternatively email your contribution. ‘Boys' Underachievement in Education - An Exploration in Selected Commonwealth Countries’- A joint publication by the Commonwealth Secretariat and the Commonwealth of Learning, exploring the causes and policy implications of this trend.
