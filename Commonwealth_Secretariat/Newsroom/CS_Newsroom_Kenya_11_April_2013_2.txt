11 April 2013
Following an invitation from the Chairman of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission of Kenya (IEBC), the Commonwealth Secretary-General, Mr Kamalesh Sharma, constituted an Observer Group for the General Elections of 4 March 2013. Prior to his final decision on whether to constitute a Commonwealth Observer Group, the Secretary-General initially sent an Assessment Mission to Kenya to assess the prevailing situation as well as the pre-electoral environment. The Assessment Mission was in the country in January 2013. The Commonwealth Observer Group for the 2013 elections in Kenya was led by H.E. Festus Mogae, former President of Botswana, and comprised seventeen eminent persons in total. The Observer Group was supported by a six-person staff team from the Commonwealth Secretariat.
