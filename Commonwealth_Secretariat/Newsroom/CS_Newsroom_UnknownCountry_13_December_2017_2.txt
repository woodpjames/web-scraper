Commonwealth invites young people to take part in major forum
13 December 2017
The Commonwealth is extending an invitation to young people with experience in youth advocacy or development to attend an important youth conference.  The Commonwealth Youth Forum promotes cross-cultural connections and consensus among youth leaders on the challenges and opportunities facing young people. Hosted by the UK Government, the Forum is part of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM), which will see leaders from all 52 member states convene in London to discuss issues related to peace, prosperity, inclusion and security. It will take place in London between 16 and 18 April, 2018.  500 youth leaders from across the Commonwealth will discuss the most vital challenges and opportunities facing young people today. To be considered young people must: Young people who are passionate about youth work and would like to take part should register their interest by 2 January 2018. Applicants must be aged 18 – 29 and will be responsible for paying for their own flights to the UK, accommodation, meals and travel while in London. The online registration form can be found here. The young people who are selected will build skills and networks, discuss issues, and then make recommendations to decision-makers at the highest levels of government. The outcome document from the Forum will feature policy proposals that can be adopted by the Commonwealth Youth Council and thematic youth-led networks, National Youth Councils, Commonwealth countries themselves, or by the Commonwealth Secretariat. The theme for next year’s Youth Forum is “Powering our Common Future”, which ties in with CHOGM’s main theme “Towards a Common Future”.
