Ministers pledge to build resilience through education
23 February 2018
Leaders attending the 20th Conference of Commonwealth Education Ministers (CCEM) have agreed a series of proposals to make sure that no-one is left behind when it comes to receiving high quality education. The theme of the conference in Nadi, Fiji, was ‘Sustainability and Resilience: Can Education Deliver?’ In the Nadi Declaration, ministers emphasised the need to make high quality teaching a priority and tackle the challenges facing education. They recognised the need to invest in early childhood learning, Technical Vocational Education and Training (TVET) and higher education. Ministers also urged the Commonwealth Secretariat to continue its work on the Curriculum Framework for Sustainable Development, to support member states to strengthen their national frameworks and implement all Sustainable Development Goals, including SDG4, which aims to ensure universal education for all. They stressed the need to promote climate change awareness through mass education beyond the classroom. Ministers proposed that education be put formally on the agenda at April’s Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in London. The Integrated Partners’ Forum (IPF) was held in parallel to the CCEM. It included young people and students, teachers, university lecturers and vice chancellors, as well as civil society organisations. Read the Nadi Declaration Read the IPF outcome statement
