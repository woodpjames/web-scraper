Princess Royal to visit Commonwealth youth centre in Zambia
26 September 2012
Anne, the Princess Royal, will visit the Commonwealth Youth Programme Regional Centre for Africa in Lusaka, Zambia, on 27 September 2012 as part of her four-day official visit to the country to mark the Diamond Jubilee of HM Queen Elizabeth II. At the Centre, Her Royal Highness will meet dignitaries, government officials and young people. The Commonwealth Youth Programme Regional Director for Africa, James Odit, said: “It is an honour to have the Princess Royal visit our Centre and interact with young people, including our interns, members of the Girl Guides and Scouts movement, the Duke of Edinburgh International Award holders and students from the University of Zambia.” The Head of the Commonwealth group of high commissioners in Zambia (also Botswana’s High Commissioner and Dean of the Diplomatic Corps), Dithlabi Tuelonyana Oliphant; University of Zambia’s Vice-Chancellor, Professor Stephen Simukanga; and senior government officials from the Zambian Ministries of Youth and Sport, and Education, will also be present to meet the Princess Royal. The programme includes a welcome performance by Nomakanjani, a youth cultural group that uses theatre, dance and music to teach Zambian youth about the issues that affect their lives and communities. The group is Zambia’s most celebrated traditional dance troupe, and has performed on local and international stages. Princess Anne is the second child and only daughter of Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh. The Commonwealth Youth Programme (CYP) has worked to champion the rights of young people, ensuring their engagement in the development process for nearly 40 years. There are four CYP Regional Centres located in Zambia, India, Guyana and Solomon Islands.
