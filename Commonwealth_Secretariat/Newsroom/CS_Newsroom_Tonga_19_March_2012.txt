19 March 2012
“It is with deep sorrow that I offer condolences on behalf of the Commonwealth of Nations to the Government and people of the Kingdom of Tonga on the sudden and untimely passing of His Majesty King George Tupou V.  Our prayers, thoughts and sentiments are with Tonga during this difficult time of national loss and mourning,” the Secretary-General said. “His Majesty King George Tupou V will always be remembered with admiration and appreciation of his many achievements and contributions. From a Commonwealth perspective, in particular, His Majesty will be remembered in this regard for his leadership and guidance in achieving democratic reforms undertaken in 2010, and the subsequent successful conduct of elections in November 2010.  These were historic steps for the Kingdom and the Commonwealth, and ensured an abiding place for him in the country’s history. “We in the Commonwealth are confident that His Majesty Tupouto’a Lavaka will continue to preside over the future development and growth of Tonga with the same qualities of dedication, national vision and leadership as the late King George Tupou V.”
