Building the institutional capacity of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission in Nigeria
UnknownDate
In recent years, economic crime has grown rapidly in its sophistication and diversity to include areas such as cyber fraud, money laundering, data collection as well as financing of terrorism and asset tracing. In Nigeria, the Economic and Financial Crime Commission (EFCC) has faced challenges in keeping pace with these changes. This project therefore aimed to enhance the capacity of the Training and Research Institute (TRI), a wholly owned agency of the EFCC, to provide international standard training services to the EFCC and other similar organisations in Nigeria and the region with particular regard to the investigation and prosecution of cyber fraud, money laundering, and terrorism financing. The beneficiaries of this project will be the relevant staff and trainers at TRI, the EFCC and other law enforcement agencies in Nigeria and the region. Ultimately, the people of Nigeria and the West Africa region will also benefit from an improved economic climate through greater investor confidence and economic growth. This project has enhanced the capacity of EFCC and other similar organisations in Nigeria and the region to deal with an increasingly varied array of economic crimes. The institutional twinning relationship with Western Australia Police has also put in place an institutional relationship that will enable better international coordination in the fight against, in particular, cybercrime.
