15 August 2016
HE Dr Jakaya Kikwete, Chair of the Commonwealth Observer Group to Zambia’s General Elections and Referendum, urges calm and tolerance following the declaration of the results of the Presidential Elections. Dr Jakaya Kikwete, the Chair of the Commonwealth Observer Group, has congratulated the President-Elect, and commended the Electoral Commission of Zambia for the successful conduct of the recently concluded General Elections and Referendum. Dr Kikwete has once again praised the people of Zambia for the peaceful manner in which they voted on 11 August. Immediately after the Chairperson of the Electoral Commission of Zambia, Justice Esau Chulu, announced the final results of the Presidential Election, Dr Kikwete said: “On 11 August, Zambians voted in dignity to elect their leaders. They continued their country’s cherished and admirable legacy of peaceful elections. The winner must be magnanimous, and those who were unsuccessful must show statesmanship and a commitment to upholding this country’s noble reputation in Africa and beyond.” He has urged all leaders and citizens of Zambia to respect the will of the people and to channel any grievances and concerns through the prescribed legal channels. Dr Kikwete continued:“As I said in the Group’s interim statement, this is the Zambian Constitutional way.” The Commonwealth Observer Group has been in Zambia since 4 August and will depart on 18 August. An Advance Team was deployed to Zambia on 22 July.
