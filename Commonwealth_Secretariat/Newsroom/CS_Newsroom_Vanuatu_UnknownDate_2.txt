In the short term, the project will improve the timely delivery of cases. In the long term, the project will contribute to business and investor confidence in the judicial system through effective judicial processes and the adoption of internationally required good practice in the administration of justice. The beneficiaries are the officials and judges within the Supreme Court and the people of Vanuatu.
