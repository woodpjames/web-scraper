Commonwealth Secretary-Generalâ€™s statement on International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination
21 March 2014
As we observe International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination we recall the commitment of Commonwealth member states collectively to promoting respect and understanding and to the development of free and democratic societies with respect for the dignity of all human beings. The Commonwealth Charter, adopted by all our member governments on behalf of the people of the Commonwealth, affirms that: 'We are implacably opposed to all forms of discrimination, whether rooted in gender, race, colour, creed, political belief or other grounds.' Acceptance of diversity, and understanding the richness of multiple identities, is fundamental to our Commonwealth principles and approach. Together we offer one another mutual support and work in practical ways towards ever more inclusive societies in which all are able to share equitably in social progress and economic prosperity.
