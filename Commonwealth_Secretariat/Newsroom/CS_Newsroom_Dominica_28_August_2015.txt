Tropical Storm Erika: Secretary-General pledges Commonwealth solidarity with Dominica
28 August 2015
Secretary-General Kamalesh Sharma today expressed Commonwealth solidarity with the Government and people of Dominica, as well as Caribbean neighbours affected by the devastation wrought by tropical storm Erika this week. “I am deeply saddened to hear of the loss of life and devastation caused in Dominica by tropical storm Erika. I feel sure Commonwealth member states will wish to offer support and practical assistance with disaster relief efforts,” he said. This follows his communication to the Prime Minister of Dominica, Roosevelt Skerrit today, conveying Commonwealth concern and support during this time of critical need. The Commonwealth collectively sees the distinctive needs of small island developing states as a priority, and continues to work alongside them, as it has done for many years, particularly in the areas of climate change and resilience.
