Young people lead Commonwealth intergenerational climate dialogue at COP22
UnknownDate
On Friday 11 November, the Commonwealth Youth Climate Change Network hosts an intergenerational panel dialogue in the margins of the COP22 global climate talks in Marrakech, Morocco. The dialogue marks the United Nations Framework on Climate Change (UNFCCC) assigned 'Young and Futures Day'. It brings together young people from across the Commonwealth, alongside other actors including government, inter-governmental organisations, civil society, and faith based organisations. The panel will be moderated by youth representatives from the Commonwealth Secretariat.  The Commonwealth Youth Climate Change Network (CYCN) was established in 2009 and aims to build the capacity of young people in their endeavours to address climate change and other environmental issues, and advocate on climate change from a youth perspective. In September, the network collaborated with other youth leaders to finalise a new youth advocacy toolkit for young people in small island developing states to influence the climate talks. The guide will help young people in the countries most affected by climate change to influence COP22. Find out more about the toolkit
