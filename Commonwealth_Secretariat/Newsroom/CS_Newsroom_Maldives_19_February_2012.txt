Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG) Ministerial Mission to Maldives 17-20 February 2012
19 February 2012
We have been in Maldives for the past three days, with the objective of developing a better understanding of the circumstances surrounding the transfer of power in this country earlier this month, as well as to promote adherence to Commonwealth values and principles. We have held detailed discussions with a wide range of stakeholders, including President Waheed, former President Nasheed, the Speaker of the Majlis, the Chief Justice, several political parties, independent institutions, relevant military and police personnel as well as others. We have also consulted international partners and civil society. We believe we are returning with the enhanced understanding of the situation that we came to seek. Our observations and recommendations will be presented to the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group, which will meet in London in the coming week. Maldives is a valued member of the Commonwealth and the Commonwealth has had a long association with the democratic transition in this country. It will continue to support Maldives in every possible way as it seeks to find a way forward at this difficult time. Note to Editors: The three-person CMAG ministerial mission to Maldives has been led by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Communications of Trinidad and Tobago, Hon Mr Surujrattan Rambachan. He was accompanied by Hon Dr Dipu Moni, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh, and Mr Dennis Richardson AO, Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Australia. CMAG stresses the importance of adherence by member countries to the Commonwealthâ€™s fundamental political values, including constitutional democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights; and in particular, the principle of separation of powers, as enshrined in the Latimer House Principles.
