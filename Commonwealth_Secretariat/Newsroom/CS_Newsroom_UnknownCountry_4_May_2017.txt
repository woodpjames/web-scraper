Commonwealth Secretary-General Patricia Scotland’s mission to Southern Africa
4 May 2017
It is a great pleasure to have been able to come to Lesotho and Malawi for my first significant visit to Southern Africa. Malawi has been an extraordinary opportunity for us to look and see what we’re doing in relation to ending early marriage, and also what we are doing to attack anti-corruption. Lesotho was an extraordinary experience. Looking at how the international community, facilitated by the Commonwealth, has been able to add to the reform programme. And the wonderful pledge of peace that all the parties in Lesotho have committed themselves. Together with the NGOs, together with the businesses, together with the churches, we see in this last six days what the Commonwealth working together in partnership can do to build peace, to spread good practice and to make a real difference to the 2.4 billion people we jointly seek to serve.
