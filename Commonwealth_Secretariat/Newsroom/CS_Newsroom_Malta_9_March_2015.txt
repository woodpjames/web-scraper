Malta Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting announcement
9 March 2015
I am delighted that Her Majesty The Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, is to be present in person to open the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Malta later this year. This is warmly welcomed by the entire Commonwealth family. All Commonwealth Heads of Governments have an enduring appreciation and profound respect for the continuing dedication and duty that The Queen brings to her role as Head of the Commonwealth. Her Majestyâ€™s presence at this pre-eminent Commonwealth summit of world leaders will carry forward an outstanding record of commitment and service by The Queen as the symbol of the free association of our nations and our peoples. We also welcome the announcement that the Prince of Wales will be present in Malta during the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. His Royal Highness was present at the 2007 CHOGM in Kampala, Uganda, and then attended and represented the Head of the Commonwealth at the 2013 CHOGM in Colombo, Sri Lanka. I am certain that Heads of Government will warmly welcome the presence of His Royal Highness in Malta. The Commonwealth family at large will be participating in Malta in the Forums for Business, Women, Youth, and Civil Society, taking place alongside the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. All value the historical and close link between the Crown and the Commonwealth. This is reinforced by the way in which The Queen has long been supported in her Commonwealth responsibilities by the Prince of Wales and other members of her family.
