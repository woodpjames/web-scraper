Commonwealth engaging Cameroon on peace and governance
1 September 2017
The Commonwealth Secretariat is engaging the government of Cameroon on a national governance strategy which reflects shared values of “peace, tolerance, respect and understanding”, says Secretary-General Patricia Scotland. Speaking to the BBC World Service’s Focus on Africa radio programme on 1 September 2017, Secretary-General Scotland said she welcomed a decision by the Cameroonian government to discontinue charges against detained political leaders. She said: “I continue to follow the developments in southwest and northwest Cameroon and have had several opportunities to raise concerns - including the allegations of human rights violations - with the government. “On the government's request, I sent a Commonwealth team to Cameroon in June to discuss how we can assist in the full implementation of its National Governance Strategy, which reflects Commonwealth values of peace, tolerance, respect and understanding.” The Secretary-General said she planned to visit Cameroon by the end of the year and “looked forward to deepening our ongoing engagement” with the country’s political leaders. In discussions with the government and all stakeholders, the Secretariat has emphasised the need for inclusive and constructive dialogue, the Secretary-General said. The Secretariat was “committing itself to action and not just rhetoric”, she added. In March, at a meeting at Marlborough House in London (pictured), Minister Delegate in the Ministry of External Relations in charge of Commonwealth Affairs, Chief Joseph Dion Ngute told Secretary-General Scotland that his government remained in dialogue with protesters.
