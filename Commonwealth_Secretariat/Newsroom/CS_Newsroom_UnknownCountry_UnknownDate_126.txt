Commonwealth People’s Forum (CPF)
UnknownDate
Held in the run up to the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) the Commonwealth People's Forum (CPF) is jointly organised by the Maltese Government and the Commonwealth Foundation. The CPF brings together civil society representatives to debate important issues facing the people of the Commonwealth. It is the single biggest opportunity for civil society to engage with Commonwealth leaders and provides an arena for civil society to establish partnerships with both the public and private sector. The theme for the People's Forum is 'What Makes Resilient Societies?' This theme will provide a civil society perspective and complements the overall CHOGM theme of 'The Commonwealth - Adding Global Value'.
