Secretary-General visits Malta
 18 November 2014
Commonwealth Secretary-General Kamalesh Sharma will visit Malta from 19-21 November 2014. During the three-day visit, Mr Sharma will review preparations for the 2015 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM), which Malta is hosting for the second time having previously done so in 2005. The Secretary-General will also meet with Malta’s President, HE Marie-Louise Coleiro Preca, the Prime Minister, Joseph Muscat, and Foreign Minister, Dr George Vella. His visit will be an opportunity to view at first-hand the arrangements for the high-level summit, which brings together the Heads of Government of all Commonwealth countries. The Secretary-General said: “I am delighted to be visiting Malta ahead of it hosting the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in 2015. “Malta joined the Commonwealth in 1964, and has been an active member and supporter ever since, especially in its championing of the interests of small states. The 2005 Malta CHOGM yielded important outcomes, including in the areas of trade and digital networking. "With Malta again assuming the chair of the Commonwealth, we can be certain that CHOGM 2015 will deliver progressive and practical outcomes. I look forward to our continued partnership over the next 12 months and beyond.” Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetings are held every two years. In 2013 the summit was hosted by Sri Lanka.
