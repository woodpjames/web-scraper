16 January 2012
Commonwealth Secretary-General Kamalesh Sharma has responded to recent developments in Pakistan including the adoption on 16 January by the National Assembly of a resolution affirming the sovereignty of Parliament and the need for continued adherence to the constitutional separation of powers. Reaffirming the Commonwealth's abiding commitment to constitutional democracy and the rule of law, Mr Sharma recalled that the Commonwealth had historically defended and promoted the democratic rights of the people of Pakistan. “The Commonwealth’s fundamental values and principles include respect for constitutional civilian democratic government, and a commitment to uphold the respective roles and relationships between the Executive, the Legislature and the Judiciary. These are embodied in the Affirmation of Commonwealth Values and Principles, adopted by all Commonwealth leaders in 2009, and specifically in the Commonwealth’s Latimer House Principles on the separation of powers,” Mr Sharma said. “We welcome and encourage the commitment of Pakistan and indeed all 54 member governments to the values and principles which have made the Commonwealth unique and widely respected,” the Secretary-General concluded.
