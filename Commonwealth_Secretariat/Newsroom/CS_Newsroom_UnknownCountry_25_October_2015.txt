HE Goodluck Jonathan, the Chair of the Commonwealth Observer Group, has been visiting polling stations in Dar es Salaam as the General Elections get underway. The former president of Nigeria met with a number of students waiting to vote including Elizabeth, a 19 year old attending the Victory Secondary School in the Kongowe Ward who told him how excited she was about voting. The Chair then visited the Coalition for Election Monitoring and Observation where he met with more young people collating social media reports from around the country. The Chair said: 'We are encouraged by the impressive turn out that we have seen at the polling stations so far. We appreciate the efforts of the people of Tanzania to ensure that the elections are going peacefully'. The former President of Nigeria is leading a 14 strong team who will observe the election process in seven locations: Mtwara, Dodoma, Arusha, Mwanza, Bukoba and Unguja and Pemba in Zanzibar. Voting began at 7am and will be open until 4pm with long queues of people in some cases extending outside the gates of polling stations.
