20 January 2015
Commonwealth Secretary-General Kamalesh Sharma has sent messages to the Presidents of Malawi and Mozambique following devastating floods in both countries in which many people have lost their lives. Mr Sharma said “On behalf of the Commonwealth family at large, I convey my condolences to those who have been bereaved. Our thoughts are with you at this time of tragic loss and national crisis. I also wish to pledge our solidarity with all those displaced or otherwise affected.” The Secretary-General urged Commonwealth member states and the international community to provide assistance where possible through the national disaster management agencies of the affected countries. The floods have led to the displacement of significant numbers of people, widespread damage to crops and livestock as well as the destruction of property.
