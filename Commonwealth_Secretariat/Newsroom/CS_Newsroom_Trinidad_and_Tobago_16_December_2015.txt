16 December 2015
Commonwealth Secretary-General Kamalesh Sharma has released the report of the Commonwealth Observer Group to Trinidad and Tobago’s parliamentary elections on 7 September 2015. The election was won by opposition party the People’s National Movement, led by Dr Keith Rowley. The People’s National Movement took 23 seats in the 41-seat Parliament, defeating the incumbent United National Congress party. The Commonwealth Observer Group was led by Sir Paul Tovua, former Speaker of Parliament and current Chairman of the Political Parties Commission of Solomon Islands. The Group concluded in its report that the elections in Trinidad and Tobago met all the key benchmarks for democratic elections. “These elections affirmed Trinidad and Tobago’s record of conducting credible and transparent elections, and are a testament to the people’s commitment to democracy,” writes Sir Paul in the foreword to the report. “On voting day, we were impressed by the diligence and professionalism of presiding officers and polling officials, who were predominantly women.  They carefully followed the prescribed election procedures, throughout the entire process, including the close, count and results process.  We were particularly struck by the high level of trust the people of Trinidad and Tobago have in the electoral system and in the Elections and Boundaries Commission (EBC).” “Every election can be improved. In this respect, and in line with our mandate, we have offered some recommendations that the new Government, the EBC, all political parties, and other relevant stakeholders may wish to consider,” Sir Paul adds. The report has been sent to the Government of Trinidad and Tobago, the Elections and Boundaries Commission and main opposition party.
