COP22: The Commonwealth at global climate talks
UnknownDate
In December 2015 world leaders signed the historic Paris Agreement on Climate Change. The accord aims to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, to pursue efforts to limit the increase to 1.5°C, and to achieve net-zero emissions in the second half of this century. Almost a year on, Morocco hosts the latest round of global climate talks. The Twenty-Second Session of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention (COP 22) takes place in Marrakech from 7 to 18 November 2016. The conference is hosted under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which was adopted during the Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit of 1992.  Related stories:
