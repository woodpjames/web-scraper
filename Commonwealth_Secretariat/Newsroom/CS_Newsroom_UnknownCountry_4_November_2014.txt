Deputy Secretary-General meets with new Executive Secretary of ADEA
4 November 2014
Commonwealth Deputy Secretary-General, Deodat Maharaj met this week with Oley Wadda-Dibba, the new Executive Secretary of Association for Development of Education in Africa (ADEA) to explore ways of strengthening partnership between the two organisations. Deputy Secretary-General, Deodat Maharaj said ‘We are keen to continue strengthening our partnership with ADEA and to work together to facilitate and encourage further dialogue between African Ministers, Chief Education Officers, Permanent Secretaries, and other stakeholders in education.’ The Commonwealth Secretariat has worked in partnership with ADEA for the past 24 years, coordinating the Working Group on the Teaching Profession (WGTP). The WGTP seeks to improve the quality of basic education in Africa and to provide support in policy development, educational tools and resources. Resource materials targeted to specific needs of countries have been developed to support the continued professional development of teachers in Africa as a result of this partnership. The partnership has also helped the Commonwealth extend their reach with African educators, and encouraged the transfer of Commonwealth expertise and knowledge to the Francophone and Lusophone countries of sub-Saharan Africa. The Commonwealth Secretariat will continue to work in partnership with ADEA, focusing on work relating to our small states member countries, knowledge development and management, and the continued global advocacy initiatives for education.
