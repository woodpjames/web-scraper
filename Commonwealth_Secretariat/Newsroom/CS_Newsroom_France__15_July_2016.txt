Commonwealth Secretary-General expresses sympathy and solidarity with the Government and people of France
 15 July 2016
Our thoughts and prayers are with the people and Government of France. This appalling terrorist attack adds Nice to the tragic list of cities that have lost too many innocent people to violent extremism. The changing nature of violence in today’s world is alarming and the indiscriminate nature of such attacks disturbs all our citizens. We can be in no doubt that in the Commonwealth and across the world this is a challenge that we cannot ignore. Fresh thinking and innovative approaches are needed for the safety of our communities, and for the most fundamental rights of every individual to life and dignity to be protected. The Commonwealth stands for global peace and security based on the harmonious co-existence of all people. At our Commonwealth Summit in Malta last November, leaders collectively committed to renewed Commonwealth action on Preventing Violent Extremism. We need to strengthen national, regional and global action on preventing violent extremism, using all of the levers at our control. This means working in collaboration with all of our partners, both inside and outside the Commonwealth family. While we mourn, we must also resolve to build communities and countries that are more resilient, more stable, more inclusive and more peaceful.
