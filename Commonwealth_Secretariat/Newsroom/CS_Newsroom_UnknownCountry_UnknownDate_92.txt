Experts to discuss mobilising resources to achieve new education goals
UnknownDate
Senior education officials who make up the Commonwealth Accelerated Development Mechanism for Education (CADME) Technical Working Group will hold their first meeting on 8-9 June 2016 at Marlborough House, Commonwealth Secretariat, London. CADME and the Education Ministers Action Group (EMAG) were both established in June 2015 by Commonwealth Education Ministers at their triennial summit in The Bahamas. In January this year EMAG members agreed the composition of the CADME Technical Working Group, with a mandate to help countries develop effective strategies to achieve the internationally ratified development goal for quality education. This meeting will enable the Group to liaise with development partners, including the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), UNESCO, Education International, Comic Relief,  Voluntary Service Overseas and the UK’s Department for International Development, and develop and finalise the CADME Action Plan.
