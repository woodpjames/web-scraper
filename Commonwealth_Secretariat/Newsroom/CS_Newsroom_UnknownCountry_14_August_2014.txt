£5 million raised for children of the Commonwealth
14 August 2014
More than £5 million was raised during the recent Commonwealth Games for children of the Commonwealth thanks to a new partnership between UNICEF, Glasgow 2014 and the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF). The £5 million already raised will allow UNICEF, the world’s leading children’s organisation, to achieve the joint partnership ambition of reaching out to every child in every Commonwealth country. This will be done in a whole range of ways. For example, in Bangladesh UNICEF is tackling child labour and child marriage, by helping to keep the most at risk children at school; in Malawi we are using sport and education to engage with young people and help reduce HIV infection; in Scotland we are helping ensure all new born babies get off to the best start in life, supporting a strong nurturing bond between parents and their babies. The campaign, called 'Put Children First', places children and young people firmly at the heart of the Games, and has achieved something never done before. Unicef will now set to work to ensure this money really does save and change millions of children’s lives across the Commonwealth, whether that is in Paisley or Papua New Guinea, Guyana or Ghana.
