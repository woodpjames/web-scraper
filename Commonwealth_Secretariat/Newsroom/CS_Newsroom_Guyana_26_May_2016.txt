Commonwealth Secretary-General congratulates Guyana on Golden Jubilee
26 May 2016
Cultural festivals, flag raising ceremonies and float parades ushered in Guyana’s Golden Jubilee of Independence. The diverse and resource-rich country, which boasts pristine Amazonian rain forests, breath-taking waterfalls, intriguing wildlife and a vibrant indigenous culture, gained their independence in 1966. That same year, along with Barbados, Botswana, and Lesotho, the country joined the Commonwealth. On Tuesday 24 May Commonwealth Secretary-General Patricia Scotland arrived in Guyana to join the historic celebrations. Speaking at a flag raising ceremony today, she said: “Guyana is a valued member of the Commonwealth and I made it a priority to be here this week to celebrate their iconic fiftieth anniversary, and their many milestones and achievements since they took the bold step to independence in 1966. “I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate the people of Guyana for these accomplishments and to assure them that the Commonwealth stands ready and willing to work with them on securing a bright and prosperous future.” During her visit to the country Secretary-General Scotland also met with the President, David Granger, the Vice-President and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Carl Greenidge, other Ministers of government and government officials. A message from President Granger stated: “The observance of this Golden Jubilee is an opportunity to meditate on the lessons of our experiences of nationhood, to celebrate our achievements, to contemplate the destiny of future generations, to continue our mission and to create a good life for all of our people.”
