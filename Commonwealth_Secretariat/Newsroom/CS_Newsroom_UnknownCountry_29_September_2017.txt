Commonwealth and United Nations pledge to work as partners
29 September 2017
Commonwealth Secretary-General Patricia Scotland has met the United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres to discuss ways the two organisations can work even closer together. The meeting took place at a critical stage in international relations with many countries facing unprecedented challenges and existential threats. In an engaging and outcomes-focused discussion on the margins of the 72nd Session of the General Assembly in New York, the two Secretaries-General underscored shared values and goals in meeting global challenges. As Commonwealth countries in Africa, Asia and the Pacific, and the Caribbean respond to crises, the two leaders agreed on the importance of working together to tackle present and future challenges in areas including disaster response, tackling climate change, conflict prevention and the empowerment of women.
