Statement on postponement of elections in Nigeria
8 February 2015
 "The Commonwealth Observer Group arrived in the country on 7 February, following an invitation from Nigeria’s Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to observe the Presidential and National Assembly Elections originally scheduled for 14 February, and to consider all factors affecting the credibility of the electoral process as a whole. "Soon after our arrival, we were informed of the decision taken by the Chairman of INEC to postpone these elections by six weeks in light of the security situation facing Nigeria. We understand and respect this decision, taken in difficult circumstances. "We look forward to the rescheduled elections taking place on 28 March, to enable the people of Nigeria to exercise their democratic right. We further urge all stakeholders to remain calm and patient and to give the Commission the support it needs to deliver these important elections. "The Commonwealth Observer Group encourages the relevant authorities to do their utmost to ensure the safety and security of all citizens and deliver the conditions which are conducive for a peaceful and credible poll."
