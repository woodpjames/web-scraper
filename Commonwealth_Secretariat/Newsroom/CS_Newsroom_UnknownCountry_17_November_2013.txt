Ministers welcomed the successful conclusion of the presidential election and noted the interim statement of the Commonwealth Observer Group, which stated that the election had been “credible and peaceful". They congratulated the people of Maldives for showing their firm commitment to democracy, and for exercising their franchise in record numbers. Ministers noted that the inauguration of the new president had taken place on 17 November, and conveyed their best wishes to him. CMAG recalled its decision of 13 November to place Maldives on its formal agenda pending the holding of a credible election on 16 November and the inauguration of a new president. Ministers therefore decided to remove Maldives from CMAG’s formal agenda.
