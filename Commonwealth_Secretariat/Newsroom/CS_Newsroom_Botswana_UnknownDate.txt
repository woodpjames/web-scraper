Country: BotswanaHost: Auditor General's OfficeStart date: 01/01/2013End date: 28/02/2015Policy area: GovernancePolicy expert: Joan Nwasike  Project manager: Tim Newman In 2005, an organisational review undertaken by the Swedish National Audit Office (SNAO) as part of their Institutional Capacity Strengthening programme recommended that the Auditor General's Office (AOG) strengthen its institutional systems, structures and operational capacity as it strives towards achieving international best practice in auditing profession. The purpose of this project has been to strengthen the capacity of the Auditor General's Office to operate effectively and improve financial governance and service delivery. This consolidates gains made from the institutional capacity building projects through technical assistance received from the SNAO and the African Organisation of English Speaking Supreme Audit Institutions (AFROSAI-E) which ended in March 2010. The principal beneficiaries are the Auditor General's Office, Ministry of Finance, Parliamentary Commission on Accounts & Finance and key Ministries. It is expected that in the medium to long-term this project will enable the OAG to deliver a more effective external audit service to the Government of Botswana. In doing the overall governance environment of the country will be improved which will bring positive social, economic and political benefits to the country. The support has focused on validating the AFROSAI-E Institutional Capacity Building Framework (ICBF) Gap Analysis, including how the audits performed comply with international standards and to make relevant recommendations on how the quality of audits could be improved. Subsequent support directed at addressing gaps identified in the analysis include the areas of: i) Independence and Legal Framework, ii) Organisation and Management; iii) Human Resources; iv) Audit Standards and Methodology, and v) Communication and Stakeholder Management.
