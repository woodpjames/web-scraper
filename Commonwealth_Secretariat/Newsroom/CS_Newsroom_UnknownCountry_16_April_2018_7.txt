UK Prime Minister: Commonwealth can set an example to the world
16 April 2018
UK Prime Minister Theresa May opened the Commonwealth Business Forum at London’s historic Guildhall this morning, on the first day of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM). Mrs May delivered her address to a packed hall of business and government leaders during a keynote session on strengthening Commonwealth Advantage. The Prime Minister said: “Freer, easier trade means stronger economies, more jobs, more choice and lower prices – and that is true here in the UK, across the Commonwealth and around the world. “With its unique scope and global voice, such a Commonwealth can set a powerful example to the world, one that demonstrates and underlines the importance of protecting free trade and the rules-based international order.” She added: “Today’s initiatives are an example of what can be done to make that happen, of how governments can lay the groundwork for growth. But you in business also have a vital role to play. The discussions here will feed into the full summit, so I hope you take the chance to share ideas and insights, to identify new challenges and new opportunities, to highlight where Commonwealth governments can step up and do more and even where, perhaps, we should step back and do a little less.”  The Business Forum will be held across the Guildhall and Mansion House in the City of London and the QEII Conference Centre and Westminster. The forum will address the CHOGM 2018 theme 'Towards a Common Future' and will focus on six key areas: accessing modern financial services; easing the pathway for business and growth; harnessing Commonwealth technology and innovation; creating a new attitude to sustainable business; mobilising an export economy; and attracting inward investment.
