Remembering Kofi Annan
18 August 2018
The Commonwealth mourns the death of Kofi Annan, a global giant who dedicated his life to promoting peace and democratic values across the world. He embodied the Commonwealth’s own values, reflected in our charter. The late Mr Annan’s legacy and distinguished work will endure in the foundations and initiatives he founded and many others he partnered with. The Secretary-General, Patricia Scotland, said: “The world will miss a true beacon of peace and hope.  It was a privilege to know him and to work with him closely - and an honour for the Commonwealth to have benefitted from his wisdom in many instances.” The Secretary-General sends sincere condolences to Mr Annan’s family on behalf of the Commonwealth.  He is survived by his wife Nane and three children. From Ghana, Mr Annan served as UN Secretary-General from 1997 to 2006. He was the first black African to lead the UN and the first Secretary-General to be appointed from its own ranks. In 2001, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize on behalf of his organisation. The current UN chief, Antonio Guterres, has been leading the tributes to his predecessor, describing Mr Annan as "a guiding force for good". "In many ways, Kofi Annan was the United Nations. He rose through the ranks to lead the organisation into the new millennium with matchless dignity and determination," he said in a statement. In 2016, Mr Annan spoke about the Commonwealth's contribution to international development.
