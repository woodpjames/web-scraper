Statement by Commonwealth Secretary-General, Kamalesh Sharma
14 March 2015
"The Commonwealth has taken note of the verdict released by the Criminal Court of Maldives on 13 March 2015, sentencing former President MohamedÂ Nasheed to 13 years imprisonment on charges under the Terrorism Act. The verdict is a significant one and at this stage is part of an ongoing judicial process which the Commonwealth will continue to follow closely. We urge restraint by all concerned in reacting to the verdict. Differences of view in Commonwealth societies are resolved in a lasting way through peaceful means, including dialogue and in accordance with democratic principles and the rule of law. The Foreign Minister of Maldives, Hon Dunya Maumoon, has made recent public comments welcoming constructive and close dialogue with international organisations. The Commonwealth is like-minded and is committed to working closely with Maldives to address issues of concern, in line with its own commitment to the values of the Commonwealth Charter including tolerance, respect and understanding, separation of powers and independence of institutions, human rights and good governance. All societies should have the space and opportunity for dialogue in order to ensure that universally shared values are advanced, and to create a stable and harmonious future. All societies should also have national institutions that enjoy the confidence, trust and respect of the people they serve. The Commonwealth is committed to offering practical support in a collaborative partnership to achieve these goals in an enduring way."
