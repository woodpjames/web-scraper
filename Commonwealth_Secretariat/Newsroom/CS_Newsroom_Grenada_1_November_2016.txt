1 November 2016
The Commonwealth Secretary-General, Patricia Scotland, said, "I am deeply saddened to hear of the passing of Sir Nicholas Brathwaite. My thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends and I extend to them my deepest condolences. We, the Commonwealth family, join the people and Government of Grenada in honouring the memory of a statesman, who led his country back to democracy, following the external intervention in 1983. "I remember him first and foremost as a visionary educator and champion of our youth, who now make up 60 per cent of the Commonwealth. "Sir Nicholas moulded so many young minds. Beginning his professional career as a primary school teacher, he rose to become the principal of the Grenada Teacher's College. Sir Nicholas also gave distinguished service as Regional Director for the Caribbean of the Commonwealth Youth Programme. "The Commonwealth family owes him a deep debt of gratitude. He made valuable contributions during the 1991 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, which agreed the Harare Declaration setting out our core Commonwealth principles and values.; "One of Sir Nicholas' enduring legacies will be the bringing together of nations through sport. His memory will continue to inspire us as we carry forward his vision in new ways through the work of Commonwealth sports integrity champions, especially in our small and vulnerable states. In this and many other ways we will maintain, as a living and growing inheritance, remembrance of his life of service to the people of Grenada, the Caribbean, and the wider Commonwealth."
