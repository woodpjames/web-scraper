Civil society agreement signed ahead of education meeting
2 April 2015
To signify greater collaborative working between the Commonwealth Secretariat, Commonwealth Foundation and the Bahamas High Commission, officials met on 31 March to sign a partnership agreement that will strengthen civil society participation in the upcoming 19th Commonwealth Conference of Education Ministers (CCEM) from 22 – 26 June. The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) is for a pre-conference meeting which will convene to discuss the role of civil society in Small States. It was signed by His Excellency Eldred E Bethel, High Commissioner of The Bahamas, Commonwealth Deputy Secretary-General, Gary Dunn and Director of the Commonwealth Foundation, Vijay Krishnarayan at the Bahamian High Commission in London. The CCEM is a triennial meeting of Education Ministers in the Commonwealth and takes place at a pivotal time as both the Millennium Development Goals and Education For All goals come to an end, and is a key opportunity for Ministers to identify the education priorities for Commonwealth member states. It also presents an opportunity to influence the Post-2015 development agenda.
