Commonwealth ministers stand resolute with Guyana on territorial controversy
27 September 2018
Commonwealth ministers have reiterated their unequivocal and collective support for the maintenance of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Guyana and its unimpeded right to the development of the entirety of its territory for the benefit of its people. The Commonwealth Ministerial Group on Guyana met in the margins of the 73rd United Nations General Assembly to discuss the latest developments in the controversy between the two countries, which spans more than 60-decades.

They echoed the Caribbean Community’s (CARICOM) support of Guyana’s application to the International Court of Justice, and commitment to working with the country towards a peaceful and definitive resolution.
