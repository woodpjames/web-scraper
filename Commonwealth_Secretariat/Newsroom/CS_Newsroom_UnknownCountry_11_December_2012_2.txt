Call for young people to contribute to ministers meeting
11 December 2012
The Commonwealth has set up a ‘Youth Voices in the Commonwealth – 2013’ online space for you to submit and vote on the questions you would like ministers to address at the 8th Commonwealth Youth Ministers Meeting (CYMM). By sharing your ideas and concerns you can help define the top issues for ministers to consider and discuss when they meet in Papua New Guinea from 15 to 19 April 2013. Contributors could also win an iPad. CYMM takes place every four years, and is a critical opportunity for ministers to advance the Commonwealth’s youth development agenda and contribute to the debate on emerging issues. It uniquely includes youth representatives at all levels of decision-making, including a seat and voice at the ministerial table. The theme for next year’s Commonwealth Youth Ministers Meeting, ‘Young people at the centre of development’, speaks directly to the critical role of young people in our 54 member countries. By using ‘Youth Voices in the Commonwealth – 2013’ you can identify issues affecting you and your peers, such as education, employment, health, the environment, leadership, equality and social inclusion. The closing date is 21 December 2012.
