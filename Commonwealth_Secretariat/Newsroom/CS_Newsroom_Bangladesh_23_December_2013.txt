Commonwealth not to have election observers in Bangladesh
23 December 2013
A recent electoral assessment mission by officials of the Commonwealth Secretariat concluded that the present electoral conditions do not meet Commonwealth election observation guidelines, particularly the need for inclusive and representative elections. It has therefore been decided that the Commonwealth will not be present at this stage to observe the forthcoming elections. The decision has been conveyed to the Government and the Chief Election Commissioner. The Commonwealth welcomes continued adherence to the Constitution of Bangladesh, looks forward to inclusive and peaceful elections in Bangladesh, and remains willing to provide electoral and other relevant assistance as is the case with all member states.
