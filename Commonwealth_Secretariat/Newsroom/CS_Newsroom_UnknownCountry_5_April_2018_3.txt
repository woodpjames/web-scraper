Technology an enabler of effective debt management
5 April 2018
The Debt Management Unit (DMU) at the Commonwealth Secretariat is hosting two delegations this week at Marlborough House to look at how technology can enable effective debt management. Sri Lanka has sent representatives from its General Treasury and Central Bank to receive hands-on guidance on how to use the various dynamic reporting tools available within the Secretariat’s debt recording and management system (CS-DRMS) to address their custom debt portfolio reporting needs. Additionally, discussions will also be held on the integration of CS-DRMS at the treasury with the bank as well as the Central Securities Depository for the information flow of primary and secondary holdings of government securities. Mr Jayalath, an assistant director at the treasury, says that they are reaping the benefits of working closely with the whole DMU team to improve the effective use of CS-DRMS in Sri Lanka. Mr Jayasinghe of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka added that the interactive sessions and sharing of knowledge regarding current issues on debt management has proven very useful. The week will be rounded off with discussions on the new debt management system called Meridian, that is being developed by the Commonwealth Secretariat and will be piloted next month. The discussions will include the transition of technology, debt management proficiencies and enhanced reporting. Separately, DMU is hosting participants from Nigeria, Botswana, Uganda, Kenya and Pakistan at the request of UK-based company Crown Agents to discuss innovative ways of integrating government financial management systems with debt management platforms.
