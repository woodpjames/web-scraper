Condolences for Ugandans caught in landslide
12 October 2018
On receiving news of the landslide which has killed many people in the district of Bududa in eastern Uganda, the Secretary-General of the Commonwealth, Patricia Scotland, has offered sympathy to the government and people of Uganda. She said, “The tragic loss of life in Uganda as a result of the landslide on Mount Elgon reminds us again of the vulnerability of so many of our Commonwealth communities to extreme weather and natural disasters. We mourn for the those who have lost their lives and offer our sympathy to all those who have been affected by this disaster. The mental and physical wounds left by the landslide and its impact on lives and livelihoods will be deep.  I commend all those who are responding to deliver immediate recovery and assistance. The Commonwealth collectively continues to work on behalf of the people of Uganda - and of all our member countries - to tackle the causes of climate change and to build resilience and reduce vulnerability to its impact.”
