The Secretary-General, who was on a two day visit to Nigeria, a region affected by the Ebola crisis, extended his appreciation and encouragement to health workers dealing with the outbreak of the virus. "The doctors and nurses are on the front line of managing the quarantine arrangements and of treating the sick, and are doing so at personal risk to themselves. We salute their untiring efforts and the sacrifice being made for others. We extend our condolences to all those who have lost family, friends and loved ones." “On behalf of the Commonwealth family, I also extend our hope and best wishes for the full recovery of those affected by the Ebola virus. I am encouraged by the solidarity and support being received from the international community to tackle this outbreak." Mr Sharma added: “Public health issues are important to the Commonwealth and form a significant part of our social development strategy. We are working with member countries to strengthen national policies and to share knowledge and other resources in order to create the best possible health services for all Commonwealth citizens.”
