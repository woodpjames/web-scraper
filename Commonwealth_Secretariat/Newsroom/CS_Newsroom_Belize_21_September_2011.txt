Statement by the Secretary-General on the demise of Belize’s first Prime Minister, George C Price
21 September 2011
Today, as we mark the 30th anniversary of Belize’s independence and remember the contributions of those who brought this about, we mourn the passing of the founding father of the nation, the Right Honourable George Cadle Price on 19 September 2011. He was the embodiment of Belize’s quest for self-determination, and the architect of its nationhood. As Belize’s first Prime Minister after independence, Mr Price, brought together the many cultures of Belize uniting them as one people. My thoughts and prayers are with the Price family at this sad time. I offer my condolences, also, to the people of Belize, who have lost a truly remarkable and inspirational leader who contributed so much to his country and to the region.
