Statement by the Commonwealth Spokesperson on Fiji
21 February 2013
Mr Uku said: “Commonwealth Secretary-General Kamalesh Sharma notes with concern recent decrees issued by the Government of Fiji, and wishes to emphasise the importance to the Commonwealth of inclusive, independent and credible constitutional and electoral processes, conducted in accordance with fundamental Commonwealth values. In relation to elections, it is essential that political parties are able to freely participate under fair, consistent and agreed rules and on a level playing field. It is equally important that the electoral process be conducted by an independent election management body. “The Secretary-General reaffirms the Commonwealth’s desire to welcome Fiji back into the Commonwealth family, upon the restoration of civilian constitutional democracy, the rule of law, and full respect for human rights, in keeping with Commonwealth values. Mr Sharma reiterates the Commonwealth’s readiness to provide support to Fiji toward these ends.”
