Commonwealth Health Ministers Meeting 2017
UnknownDate
All Commonwealth governments have committed to taking steps to accelerate universal health coverage (UHC); that is, making progress towards ‘ensuring that all people can use the promotive, preventive, curative, rehabilitative and palliative health services they need, of sufficient quality to be effective, while also ensuring that the use of these services does not expose the user to financial hardship’ - World Health Organization The CHMM will provide member countries with an opportunity to examine a variety of options for sustainably funding UHC, and have the opportunity to share country experiences of effective funding models. Ministers will discuss the challenges and opportunities they face in their efforts to make progress towards UHC. Ministers will also examine and share pertinent experiences in addressing global security challenges, and their efforts to reduce all forms of violence, including family violence. The collective Commonwealth perspective on these issues and other matters will be articulated at the 70th World Health Assembly between 22-27 May 2017. CHMM will be chaired by Dr George Pamboridis, Minister of Health for Cyprus.
