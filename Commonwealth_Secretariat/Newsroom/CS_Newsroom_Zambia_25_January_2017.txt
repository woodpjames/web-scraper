Peace in the home essential first step to community peace, says Zambia’s vice president
25 January 2017
Zambia’s Vice President Inonge Mutukwa Wina and High Commissioner Muyeba Shichapwa Chikonde have paid a call on the Commonwealth Secretary-General at Marlborough House in London. The vice president expressed appreciation for the support and benefits Commonwealth membership bring to the people of Zambia, and the Southern African region. Mrs Wina agreed that tackling all forms of domestic violence, with peace in the home as an essential first step towards building peace in our communities, was an important aspect of celebrating the new Commonwealth theme, ‘A Peace-building Commonwealth’, in March. She welcomed the impact being made by other Commonwealth initiatives that focus on economic and social development, particularly towards the empowerment of women and girls.
