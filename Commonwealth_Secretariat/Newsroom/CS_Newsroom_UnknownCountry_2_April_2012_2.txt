Commonwealth Secretary-General Kamalesh Sharma today announced the appointment of Richard Uku as his new Spokesperson and as Director of the Communications and Public Affairs Division of the Commonwealth Secretariat. Mr Uku takes up the appointment immediately, replacing Eduardo del Buey who resigned last year. Mr Sharma said that Mr Uku, who is a Nigerian, British and Trinidad & Tobago national, brings a wealth of knowledge and experience - having previously led communications and public affairs for other international and multilateral organisations. “Mr Uku joins the Commonwealth at a time when the rate of reform and renewal has been ratcheted up. A priority in that continuing process is to ensure that we create ever greater impact and communicate more effectively how it is that we deliver value for our two billion citizens worldwide. I am delighted that Mr Uku will be at the heart of this, leading efforts to increase our visibility, raise global awareness and heighten the profile of our work in serving Commonwealth citizens and helping each of our 54 member states to build on the pillars of democracy, development and diversity. We are very pleased that the Secretariat will have the benefit of his extensive experience and expertise,” the Secretary-General said.  Mr Uku joins the Commonwealth Secretariat from the African Development Bank where he was the Head of External Relations and Communications. Prior to that, he was Group Head, Brand and Communication, at Ecobank Transnational Incorporated (ETI). He previously worked as speechwriter to the Deputy Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, and was Head of Communication for the Africa Region of the World Bank. Mr Uku was also Vice President for Government and Emerging Markets with the international public relations firm, Burson-Marsteller.
