The Commonwealth: Delivering Practical Results
8 December 2011
Commonwealth issues and priorities that were referred to Heads of Government at the 2011 Commonwealth Heads of Goverment Meeting (CHOGM) in Perth by ministerial and other meetings that had taken place over the two years since the previous CHOGM, or by the Commonwealth Secretary-General, were considered at the meeting of the Committee of the Whole (COW) in Perth immediately prior to CHOGM. These issues and priorities are reflected in this Memorandum, which concurrently provides a report by the Commonwealth Secretariat on its work to deliver the mandates and directions provided by member governments, including through the agreed Strategic Plan. The Memorandum also provides a summary briefing to the COW of the work of other Commonwealth intergovernmental organisations and associated Commonwealth organisations.
