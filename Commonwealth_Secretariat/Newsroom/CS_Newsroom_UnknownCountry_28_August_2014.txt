Building the resilience of small states - video
28 August 2014
Small states face a special set of development challenges, making them especially vulnerable to economic and environmental shocks. Challenges include their small but growing populations and limited resources, and high energy, communication and transportation costs. The relative small size of their economy means that any global event has a disproportionate effect. Small states are also highly susceptible to natural disasters. One of the biggest threats they face is climate change and sea level rises. Small states are working hard to address these challenges despite their capacity constraints. With this in mind, the Commonwealth is taking action to boost the resilience of small states.
