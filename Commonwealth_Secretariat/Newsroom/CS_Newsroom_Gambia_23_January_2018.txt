The Gambia presents formal application to re-join the Commonwealth
23 January 2018
To mark the final step of The Gambia’s bid to re-enter the Commonwealth, Ambassador Francis Blain has presented Secretary-General Patricia Scotland with his country’s formal application. The presentation took place during a meeting at Marlborough House yesterday. The Deputy Ambassador of The Gambia to the UK was also present. Having received this formal application, the next step in the process is for the Secretary-General to assess whether there is consensus among the Heads of Government of existing member countries for The Gambia to rejoin the Commonwealth family of nations. The Gambia became a member of the Commonwealth on achieving independence in 1965. It withdrew from membership in 2013. The decision to begin the process of applying for readmission was made in February 2017 by President Barrow, who came to power following elections in December 2016.
