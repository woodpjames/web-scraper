Commonwealth Secretary-General statement on the terror attack in London
23 March 2017
I offer my personal and heartfelt condolences to the government of the United Kingdom and its people, and all of those who lost loved ones or who were injured in yesterday's terror attack in London. What the world witnessed was not only an attack on innocent bystanders and brave police officers, but a crime perpetrated to strike fear, mayhem and paralysis at the heart of a Commonwealth country's democracy. The UK's Houses of Parliament are not just a place where laws are made but where solutions to matters of importance, which affect the lives of millions, are designed, debated and decided. Our Commonwealth Countering Violent Extremism unit has been established to share learning on how to counter violent extremism and terrorism and offer practical advice across the Commonwealth and is working with the UK and all other member states. As a valued member, the UK knows that the people of the Commonwealth stand shoulder to shoulder with all the people of the UK in their hour of sadness. Today, I have asked that all the flags of the Commonwealth in Marlborough House be flown at half-mast to show our solidarity not only with the UK but with all nations who have survived terrorist attacks or are under the threat of terror. We need to remain vigilant. We need, as people of goodwill, to stand together with people of all faiths and those of none, to be strong, to be courageous and do everything with love to defeat those who would try to drive a wedge between us through fear and confusion.
