"Bangladesh is leading the way with its 'SDG tracker', where it can evaluate the impact sport in delivering the Sustainable Development Goals," said Secretary-General Scotland. "We agreed that sport plays a vital role in education, empowering women and girls, trade, economy and peace building in the Commonwealth. "Bangladesh has kindly agreed to share its tracker so other member states can use what it as a template for best practice." Minister Sikder and the Secretary-General agreed the country's youth should be a priority when embracing sport as a developmental tool to ensure social and economic empowerment.
