Commonwealth Secretary-General Kamalesh Sharma arrived in Nauru on 29 October 2012 for a three-day visit. The Secretary-General's first day in the South Pacific island state began with a series of meetings with government ministers. Mr Sharma called on the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and Minister for Health and Sports, Dr Kieren Keke. Nauru is currently Chair of the 44-strong Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), which led to discussions on the challenges faced by small island states, including access to international finance to mitigate the effects of climate change and to promote the sustainable development priorities of small island developing states. The Secretary-General also met with the Minister for Finance and Education, Roland Kun, as well as the Minister for Transport, Telecommunications and ICT, Riddell Akua, on the transport system in Nauru and the development of infrastructure. During his first official visit to Nauru, the Secretary-General will be received by President Sprent Dabwido; the Speaker of Parliament, Ludwig Scotty; and other members of parliament.
