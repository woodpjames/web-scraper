Presentation of the 2015 Human Development Report
UnknownDate
A presentation by the report’s lead author Mr Selim Jahan, Director of the Human Development Report Office, introduced by Commonwealth Deputy Secretary-General Deodat Maharaj.The presentation will be followed by a discussion with audience members on the report and the progress and performance of Commonwealth member countries. The 2015 Human Development Report ‘Work for Human Development’, launched on 14 December 2015, examines the links, both positive and negative, between work and human development in a rapidly changing world of work. Fast globalisation, technological revolution, demographic transitions and many other factors are creating new opportunities, but also posing risks. The report examines how the benefits of this new world of work are not equally distributed, generating winners and losers. The report argues for a broader notion of work, one that goes beyond the jobs framework, to confront both persistent challenges such as human deprivations, inequalities, unsustainability, and gender imbalances in paid and unpaid work – as well as emerging ones –erosion of jobs, skills gaps, climate change and others. It concludes with a series of policy recommendations on how to enhance human progress through promotion of workers’ rights and broader access to social protection. 10.00 Arrival and registration 10.30 Welcome and introduction by Mr Deodat Maharaj, Commonwealth Deputy Secretary-General, Economic and Social Development 10.45 Lead presentation in the 2015 Human Development Report: Mr Selim Jahan, Director of the Human Development Report Office 11.15 Interactive dialogue
