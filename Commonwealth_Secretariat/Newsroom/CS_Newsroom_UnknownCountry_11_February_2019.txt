11 February 2019
Applications to attend a youth conference in Malaysia are now open. The Commonwealth Secretariat and the Royal Commonwealth Society will host a four-day Commonwealth Youth Dialogue Conference: Youth Workshop on International Peace and Security and Building Community Resilience from the Ground Up, in Kuala Lumpur from 2-5Â April 2019. The conference aims to build the capacity of emerging young leaders to bridge communities, lead action and prevent violent extremism through dialogue. Young people at the conference will take part in interactive workshops on community cohesion, active citizenship, leadership, digital literacy and preventing violent extremism. The event also includes a day-long simulation of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) where debates will focus on international peace and security. The programme will enable young people to better understand social change through democratic institutions and appreciate the views of others locally and globally. Participants will gain a better understanding of their role as actors to prevent and counter violent extremism through informal and creative means. Following the summit, they will be expected to deliver future youth-led activities for their peers to help counter violent radicalisation.
