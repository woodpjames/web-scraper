Commonwealth conference on excellence in public service
1 May 2012
Leadership is vital in driving the quest for excellence in public service delivery, said Dr Joan Nwasike, Head of Thematic Programmes at the Commonwealth Secretariat’s Governance and Institutional Development Division. “Inspirational leadership backed by political will helps determine the speed and extent in which quality service delivery can be enhanced for the good of the citizenry,” said Dr Nwasike. “These are two crucial factors, apart from human and financial resources and access to technology, which impact on public confidence on the efficiency of public service institutions and processes in delivering a spectrum of citizen services. The quality and professionalism of public service institutions are critical in supporting national development and economic growth.” Some 100 Sri Lankan government officials will benefit from discussions at a Commonwealth conference in Colombo from 8 to 9 May 2012 focused on 'Strengthening Public Service Excellence'. The event is co-organised by the Commonwealth Secretariat, Commonwealth Association for Public Administration and Management and Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Public Administration and Home Affairs. Senior public sector officials and public administration experts from Commonwealth member countries such as India, Malaysia and the United Kingdom will share their insights and experiences at the two-day conference.
