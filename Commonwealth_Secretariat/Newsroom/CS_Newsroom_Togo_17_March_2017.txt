17 March 2017
The government of Togo is exploring making a formal bid for membership of the Commonwealth, a spokesman for the Commonwealth Secretariat confirmed today. The spokesman said, “We can confirm that Togo has expressed interest in becoming a Commonwealth member state. We are at the first step of the process, which could result in the government formally applying for membership. “Decisions on membership are made by the 52 heads of government, who have laid out clear criteria for any country wishing to join. This includes an acceptance of Commonwealth fundamental values and principles, such as a commitment to democracy, the rule of law and independence of the judiciary, the protection of human rights, and equality of opportunity.”
