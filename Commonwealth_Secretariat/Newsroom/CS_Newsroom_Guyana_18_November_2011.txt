The Group was constituted by Commonwealth Secretary-General Kamalesh Sharma at the invitation of the Government of Guyana. “The Commonwealth has a long history of engagement with Guyana, and we are pleased to be observing these important elections,” said the Secretary-General. “We hope the electoral campaign and ballot will further strengthen democratic processes there, and that all participants will engage peacefully and constructively throughout.” The Group’s mandate is to observe and consider all aspects of the electoral process with a view to assessing compliance with the standards for democratic elections to which Guyana is committed. Where appropriate, the Team may also make recommendations for the future strengthening of the electoral framework. The Group will act impartially and independently, and conduct itself according to the standards expressed in the International Declaration of Principles for Election Observation, to which the Commonwealth is a signatory. The Group’s report will be submitted to the Commonwealth Secretary-General, who will convey it to the Government of Guyana, the Guyana Electoral Commission, political parties, and in due course to all Commonwealth governments.
