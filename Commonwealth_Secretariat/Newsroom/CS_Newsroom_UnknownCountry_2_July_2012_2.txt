Youth Work Week goes global
2 July 2012
Youth Work Week, which runs from 5 to 11 November, will be celebrated across the Commonwealth for the first time this year. This follows a partnership between the Commonwealth Secretariat and England’s National Youth Agency. The National Youth Agency has organised Youth Work Week since 1993, providing an opportunity for youth organisations, youth workers and young people to highlight the value of their work. Youth workers are instrumental to the positive development of young people, ensuring they fulfil their potential and become assets to their societies. This year, Youth Work Week will adopt the Commonwealth’s 2012 theme: Connecting Cultures, with young people and youth workers from across the Commonwealth invited to participate by showcasing the role youth work plays in bringing people together. Fiona Blacke, Chief Executive of the National Youth Agency, said: “Youth workers transform young people’s lives and Youth Work Week is a great way for organisations and individuals to stand up and tell others about the impact of their work. We are delighted to be partnering with the Commonwealth Secretariat to extend this important campaign in recognition of the brilliant youth work that takes place in its 54 member countries.” Commonwealth Deputy Secretary-General Mmasekgoa Masire-Mwamba, said: “The Commonwealth has a long history of promoting excellence in youth work through its professional development programmes. Our association with the National Youth Agency and Youth Work Week will serve to strengthen our joint commitment to this important vocation.” Materials to support individuals and organisations celebrating Youth Work Week will be launched in July.
