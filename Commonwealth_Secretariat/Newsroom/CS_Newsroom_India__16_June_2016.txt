India offers fully-funded training courses to Commonwealth citizens
 16 June 2016
The Government of India is giving Commonwealth citizens the opportunity to attend fully-funded training courses across a range of areas, including rural development, IT, telecommunications and renewable energy, in association with the Commonwealth Secretariat. The courses are sponsored by the Government of India and delivered by Indian institutions through the Indian Technical and Economic (ITEC) Programme. ITEC is part of the Commonwealth Secretariat’s Third Country Training Programmes, which aims to build capacity in member countries by providing specialist training in key areas of development work. “I would like to thank the Government of India for providing this excellent opportunity for Commonwealth citizens to develop and hone their skills and expertise in areas which are crucial for sustainable development,” said Pauline Campbell, Head of Technical Assistance at the Commonwealth Secretariat. She added: “This is a fantastic opportunity for those in the public and private sectors, as well those who work with NGOs. I encourage you to check the eligibility criteria and send your application early, in order to meet the deadlines.” The Government of India has allocated 30 places for participants from Commonwealth member states for the 2016-2017 Programme.
