Commonwealth Secretary-General Kamalesh Sharma has mourned the death of nearly 200 people in a ferry disaster off the Tanzanian islands of Zanzibar. “The Commonwealth stands as one in solidarity with the Government and people of Tanzania and Zanzibar in particular. We deeply regret the loss of life and injuries sustained by hundreds in the tragic ferry accident,” Mr Sharma said in a statement issued in London. “We express our deepest sympathies to Tanzanian President Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete and Zanzibar President Dr Ali Mohamed Shein,” Mr Sharma said. "Through them, we convey our sincere condolences to those bereaved and best wishes for the speedy recovery of those injured." Zanzibar comprises the islands of Unguja and Pemba.
