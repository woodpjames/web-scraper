Regenerative Development to Reverse Climate Change Conference
UnknownDate
The Commonwealth, in collaboration with the Cloudburst Foundation, will host the high-level Regenerative Development to Reverse Climate Change Conference on 18 May. The meeting will launch a new initiative aimed at reversing the human impact of climate change. It will also present the findings of a two-day Commonwealth climate change workshop which took place in October 2016. More than 60 scientists, ecologists, activists, academics and funders explored cutting-edge technologies and approaches to reduce harmful carbon emissions and tackle global warming, while addressing poverty and boosting economic development. They also discussed how these approaches can fit into the Commonwealth programme on climate change, which includes the Climate Finance Access Hub to help countries access millions pledged by the international community for climate action. Delegates to the conference will discuss next steps, including introducing the new Commonwealth strategy at the United Nations Climate Change Conference, Cop23, in November, and rolling it out to Commonwealth member governments. Commonwealth High Commissioners, leading climate change experts and representatives from the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification and other international organisations are expected to attend. Keynote speakers include global advocate on climate change action and former president of Kiribati, Anote Tong; former UN Secretary Generalâ€™s special envoy on climate change and former president of Ireland, Mary Robinson; New York bestselling climate change author Paul Hawken; scientist Janine Benyus; design, art, science, and technology specialist David McConville; and authority on regenerative development Ben Haggard.
