Commonwealth Special Envoy Ibrahim Gambari to visit Zambia
23 November 2017
The Commonwealth Secretary-General’s Special Envoy to Zambia, Prof Ibrahim Gambari, will travel to Zambia for a four-day visit from 23-27 November.  During this visit, Prof Gambari is expected to progress discussions on the dialogue framework following initial consultations he held during his previous visit in September 2017. Prof Gambari will meet with State officials, leaders of political parties, representatives of civil society organisations, church leaders, traditional leaders and other national and international stakeholders. The Secretary-General of the Commonwealth, Patricia Scotland, appointed Prof Gambari last month as her Special Envoy after she negotiated a commitment from President Edgar Lungu and the Leader of the main opposition UPND, Hakainde Hichilema, to engage in forward-looking political dialogue to address issues of common interest ahead of future elections in the country.
