Commonwealth releases progress report
29 September 2011
Commonwealth Secretary-General Kamalesh Sharma has given an update on the progress in fulfilling the mandates set by the association’s 54-member governments. In a statement to the Executive Committee of the Board of Governors, Mr Sharma said: “We have come a long way on many fronts, and I believe the Commonwealth Secretariat is getting better equipped to deal with contemporary challenges and to use opportunities. That has been the theme of my term: equipping the Secretariat and supporting the member states to adapt and benefit in ways that are appropriate to contemporary times. The other theme has been delivery of added value at the national and global levels. “The Commonwealth is a great global good, and I have sought to ensure that our contribution – in advocacy, policy, or practically – has been oriented towards advancing shared Commonwealth values, principles and goals that support our member governments and the communities they represent and that retain our global worth.”
