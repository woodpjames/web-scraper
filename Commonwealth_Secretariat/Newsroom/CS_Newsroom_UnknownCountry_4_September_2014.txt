2015 Commonwealth theme announced
4 September 2014
 ‘A Young Commonwealth’ has been chosen as the theme for Commonwealth Day 2015, which takes place on 9 March. Announcing the theme, Secretary-General Kamalesh Sharma said: “People aged 29 or under account for the majority of the Commonwealth’s population, and play a vital role at the heart of sustainable development and democracy. ‘A Young Commonwealth’ recognises the capacity, contribution and potential of young people, particularly in 2015 when the world will define a new global development framework. “The Commonwealth is also a family of dynamic countries at the forefront of innovation, growth and contributing global value. As a diverse and increasingly connected global network, we bring fresh perspectives and new ideas. We will always remain a contemporary and young Commonwealth.” Each year, a theme is agreed in consultation with representatives of Commonwealth civil society and presented for approval by Her Majesty The Queen, Head of the Commonwealth. Commonwealth Day take place each year on the second Monday of March. Celebrations offer an opportunity to promote understanding on global issues, international co-operation and the work of Commonwealth organisations, which aim to improve the lives of citizens.
