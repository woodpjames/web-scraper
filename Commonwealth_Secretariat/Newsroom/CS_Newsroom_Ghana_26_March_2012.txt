Ghana meeting to discuss women in leadership
26 March 2012
A three-day high-level meeting to discuss women’s representation in decision-making will take place in Accra, Ghana, from 27 to 29 March 2012. The meeting will be attended by ministers, senior officials, policy-makers and regional development organisations and will focus on improving women’s representation in politics. The Commonwealth Africa Regional Colloquium: Women Leaders as Agents of Change is organised by the Commonwealth Secretariat’s Gender Section and the Government of Ghana. Commonwealth Deputy Secretary-General Mmasekgoa Masire-Mwamba said: “The Commonwealth is not only promoting women’s role as agents of change, but also celebrating the enormous contributions being made by women, against the odds, in many spheres and sectors of society. “It is particularly important for women leaders from Africa to share perspectives and devise strategies for transformational leadership on the continent.” The programme will include interventions from representatives of civil society and the media who will discuss the role of stakeholders as catalysts for empowering women’s leadership. This is the second in a series of pan-Commonwealth colloquiums on women in leadership. The first took place in June 2011 in Trinidad and Tobago, in the Caribbean, and a third is scheduled for the Pacific region later this year.
