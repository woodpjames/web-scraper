The Bahamas announces logo competition winner for 2015 education meeting
27 August 2014
The winner of a logo design competition for the 19th Conference of Commonwealth Education Ministers (19CCEM) was announced on the 28 July at a press conference in Nassau, The Bahamas, by the Minister of Education, Science and Technology, Jerome Fitzgerald. Daniel Hanna’s maypole design, signifying the unity of all participating countries, was chosen from among 50 entries across the Caribbean country, which is hosting the meeting next year. “It is a collective product that signifies unity. It does not matter the paths that cross around the maypole, they merge and mesh,” said Mr Hanna. Mr Fitzgerald described the competition as a national undertaking, adding:  “This logo will tell the world that the 19th CCEM is being held in The Bahamas.” The logo will be used all literature, bags, shirts, paraphernalia and in all print and digital media including the website and Facebook page associated with the conference. The 19th CCEM will be held from June 22-26, 2015 and will focus on quality education for equitable development. Education ministers from member countries meet every three years to discuss issues of concern and interest, to formulate policy on key development issues and to build consensus at a high political level within the Commonwealth.
