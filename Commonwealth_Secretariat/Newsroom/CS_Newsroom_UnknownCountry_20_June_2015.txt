"A pleasant good morning to you all. We are pleased to be in Botswana among friends. The Commonwealth Secretariat celebrates with you in acknowledging the 20th anniversary of CLGF and your achievements in support of local democracy and local government. I bring warm greetings from Commonwealth Secretary-General, Kamalesh Sharma who unfortunately could not be here. I am pleased to deliver remarks on his behalf, at this important Commonwealth Local Government Forum meeting. This year is monumental in the international quest to advance major developmental processes. Next month in Addis Ababa, will see a global discussion on Financing the new Sustainable Development agenda. In September in New York, we expect the Sustainable Goals to be adopted; In November in Malta, Prime Minister Hon. Dr Joseph Muscat will host the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, under the theme 'The Commonwealth - Adding Global Value'. These are perfect opportunities for the Commonwealth to agree on, and provide global leadership on the operationalisation of the sustainable development goals; The CHOGM Outcomes will dovetail the Global Climate Change Summit in December later this year." View full transcript
