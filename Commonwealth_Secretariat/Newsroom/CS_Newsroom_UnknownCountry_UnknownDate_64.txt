Commonwealth Youth Work Week 2016 Symposium
UnknownDate
Across the Commonwealth, youth workers employ sport and arts programmes to empower young people and contribute to their positive development. The Commonwealth Youth Work Week 2016 Symposium aims to increase awareness of the value of sport and arts programmes as non-formal education methods of youth empowerment work. The focus will be on the use of non-formal education to create a conducive learning environment to empower young people. Participants will be drawn from students interested in or already participating in youth work, youth workers, youth work institutions, youth organisations, sport and arts practitioners, High Commissioners, academics and the Commonwealth family. The symposium falls during Commonwealth Youth Work Week 2016, held from 7-13 November, under the theme ‘Empowering young people through sport and arts’.
