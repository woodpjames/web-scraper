The Indian high commissioner, His Excellency Mr. Y.K. Sinha, paid a call on Secretary-General Patricia Scotland at Marlborough House today. Mr Sinha reaffirmed India's support for the Commonwealth and the work being carried out by Secretary-General Scotland. This included building on the restructuring of the Secretariat, which was started under the previous Secretary-General, Kamalesh Sharma. The high commissioner was briefed on the extensive work undertaken for member states by the trade division. These include efforts to boost exports and linking Africa's least developed countries into India's global value chains, the point from which an idea is conceived through to consumers buying the product. Mr Sinha conveyed his appreciation for the Secretariat's initiative to launch the India-Commonwealth SME Association, which will expand trade and investment links with the private sector and member countries. The two leaders also explored the possibility of an exciting new initiative - the Commonwealth Community Cricket Cup.
