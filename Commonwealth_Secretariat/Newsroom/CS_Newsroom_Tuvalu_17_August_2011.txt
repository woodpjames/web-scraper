Commonwealth Deputy Secretary-General meets Tuvalu Prime Minister
17 August 2011
Commonwealth Deputy Secretary-General Ransford Smith held talks with Tuvalu’s Prime Minister Willy Telavi during his high-level visit to the Pacific Island state from 9 to 10 August 2011. Discussions centred on preparations for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in Perth, Australia, in October, and on recommendations from the report of the Eminent Persons Group, which has been tasked by Commonwealth leaders to sharpen the impact, strengthen the networks and raise the profile of the Commonwealth. Mr Telavi warmly acknowledged the Commonwealth’s past technical support to Tuvalu through the Commonwealth Secretariat’s Maritime Boundary Programme and its assistance to the office of the Attorney-General. He also welcomed possible future help from the Commonwealth Pacific Governance Facility, which is planning a major regional programme on integrity in public procurement. During his two-day trip, Mr Smith also briefed the Speaker of the House of Parliament, Kamuta Latasi, and the Attorney-General, Ese Apianelu, on CHOGM and possible additional technical co-operation from the Commonwealth.
