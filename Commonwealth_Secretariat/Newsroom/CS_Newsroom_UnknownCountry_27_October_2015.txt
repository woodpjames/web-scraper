Deepening the relationship with UNESCO
27 October 2015
Commonwealth Secretary-General, Kamalesh Sharma, and the Director-General of UNESCO, Irina Bokova, agreed to strengthen their relationship during a working lunch at Marlborough House today. UNESCO and the Commonwealth have been cooperating since the 1980s. “Our two organizations share a commitment to education, cultural diversity and the creation of inclusive, tolerant societies,” stated Mr Sharma. “These priorities take on new importance as the international community comes to grips with emerging challenges such as violent extremism.” Discussions focused on the renewal of the long-term Collaboration Agreement, first signed in October 2009. "I look forward to expanding our partnership with the Commonwealth,” said Ms Bokova.  “Working together, we can take innovative ideas to a global scale.  Our mutual interest in girls' education, social inclusion, youth participation and leadership, for example, helps to create a better future for millions of young people - by giving them a voice and helping them to find a place in their communities.” UNESCO and the Commonwealth will continue discussions over the next months and plan to sign a new agreement in the first half of 2016.
