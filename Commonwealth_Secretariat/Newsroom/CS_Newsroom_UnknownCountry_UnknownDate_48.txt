Commonwealth Class debate: What does ‘belonging’ mean to you?
UnknownDate
This debate aims to find out what gives school children between the ages of seven to fourteen a sense of belonging, and what makes them feel appreciated by the world and people around them. Some questions to consider: Commonwealth Class is a joint project between the Commonwealth Secretariat and the British Council. It has been running since 2013 and has already reached over 120,000 schools. The project aims to educate children aged seven to fourteen about the values and principles of the Commonwealth and to increase understanding about the lives of young people in other countries. It encourages students to collaborate and learn together, and consider how they can be more active and responsible global citizens.
