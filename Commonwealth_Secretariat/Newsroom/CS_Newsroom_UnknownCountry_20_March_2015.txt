Malcolm Fraser - Tribute by Commonwealth Secretary-General Kamalesh Sharma
20 March 2015
Commonwealth Secretary-General Kamalesh Sharma received the news of the passing of Mr Malcolm Fraser with deepest regret and sadness, and extended his condolences to Mr Fraser’s family and to the people of Australia on behalf of the Commonwealth family. Mr Sharma said: “Malcolm Fraser was a Commonwealth man to the core and his passing will be mourned across the Commonwealth. His contribution to advancing Commonwealth values was immense, both during his time in office, and in retirement. He will be remembered in particular for the distinction with which he served as Co-Chair of the Commonwealth Group of Eminent Persons on South Africa from 1985–86, working towards the dismantling of the apartheid system and peaceful transition to majority rule. We recall with gratitude his services to the Commonwealth.” Mr Fraser, who was Prime Minister from 1975-1983, played a leading role in many Commonwealth initiatives, and at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetings of 1977 in London, United Kingdom; of 1979 in Lusaka, Zambia; and of 1981 in Melbourne, Australia, which he chaired.
