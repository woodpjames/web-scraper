Maldives Presidential Elections 9 November 2013: Interim Statement
10 November 2013
The eight-member Commonwealth Observer Group, constituted by the Secretary-General, has been in the country since 6 November at the invitation of the Elections Commission of Maldives. A Commonwealth Observer Group was first deployed for the 7 September Presidential Election, which was later annulled by the Supreme Court. The Commonwealth Secretary-General subsequently constituted an Observer Group for the 28 September and 19 October elections, both of which were cancelled. On election day, Commonwealth observers visited seven of the country’s atolls, and witnessed the opening, voting, closing and counting of ballots. The teams interacted with election officials and other observers during the course of the day. Key findings: As the election process will continue into a run-off poll, scheduled now for 16 November, this interim statement outlines the Group’s findings so far. Commonwealth Observers will be present for the second round and the Group will issue a final report, including recommendations, following the conclusion of the process.
