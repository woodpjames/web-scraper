7 September 2017
The Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea, Peter O’Neil, has formally received the Commonwealth Observer Group report on the 2017 election, held in June-July. The Commonwealth’s Secretary-General, Patricia Scotland, presented the report during a meeting in Apia, Samoa, on the margins of the 48th Pacific Islands Forum. The two discussed some of the challenges observed by the group, such as the state of the electoral roll. The prime minister expressed his appreciation for the work of the group, chaired by the former Governor-General of New Zealand, Sir Anand Satyanand. Mr O’Neil welcomed the Secretary-General’s offer of support, including the return of Sir Anand to discuss a long-term programme to strengthen the country’s electoral processes with the government, electoral commision and other stakeholders. The meeting also covered Commonwealth initiatives such as the Pacific 2050 report on sustainable futures, the Blue Charter on oceans development, key issues at the 48th PIF summit, and preparations for the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in April 2018.
