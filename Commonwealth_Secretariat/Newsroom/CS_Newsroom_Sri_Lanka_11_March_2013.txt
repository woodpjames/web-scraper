11 March 2013
At the 2007 CHOGM in Kampala, Uganda, Heads took note of the offer from the President of Sri Lanka for his country to host CHOGM. At their meeting in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, two years later, Commonwealth leaders accepted the offer from the Prime Minister of Australia to host the 2011 CHOGM. They also accepted the offers of the President of Sri Lanka and the Prime Minister of Mauritius to host the 2013 and 2015 CHOGMs respectively. Meeting in Perth, Australia in 2011, Commonwealth Heads of Government reaffirmed their decisions to meet next in Sri Lanka in 2013 and thereafter in Mauritius in 2015. They also welcomed the offer by Malaysia to host the 2019 CHOGM.
