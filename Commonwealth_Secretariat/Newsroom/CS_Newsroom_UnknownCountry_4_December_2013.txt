Commonwealth Day Observance 2014: registration for UK schools and youth groups ends Friday
4 December 2013
This year’s Commonwealth Day Observance will be celebrated at Westminster Abbey on Monday 10th March. UK schools and youth groups are invited to register their interest for batches of either 5 or 10 tickets (including students and staff) to attend the Observance. The deadline for registration is Friday 17th January 2014. IMPORTANT: Please note that registering interest does not guarantee an invitation to the Observance Day event, or that schools/youth groups will receive the requested number of tickets. Priority will be given to schools and groups that have not attended the Observance before. Thereafter, tickets will be allocated to schools by ballot. The Observance is organised by the Royal Commonwealth Society. It is the biggest multi-faith celebration in the United Kingdom and takes the form of an hour long service at Westminster Abbey featuring a mixture of testimonies, readings, hymns and musical performances. It is attended by Her Majesty The Queen, senior politicians, High Commissioners, Commonwealth dignitaries and up to 200 other VIPs. It is also attended by over 1,000 schoolchildren, with 2,000 people present in total. More information about registering
