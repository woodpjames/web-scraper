Supporting the Attorney General's office in Kenya
UnknownDate
The purpose of this project is to strengthen the capacity of the Attorney General's Office and the Kenya Law Reform Commission with regard to drafting the legislation required to implement the provisions of the new constitution of The Republic of Kenya. The new constitution provides that over a period of five years from the date of the constitution coming into force (27 August 2010) that legislation in 49 subject areas shall be enacted. Excellent progress has been made over the past two years, particularly with regard to devolved government and land issues, however, there remains a significant body of legislation required to complete the implementation process.  In the short term, the project will facilitate the timely drafting of legislation required. Over the longer term the project will seek to build the capacity of the Attorney General’s Office and the Kenya Law Reform Commission in order to allow for the full implementation of the new constitution. CFTC assistance (x2 full time legislative drafters) has enabled the Kenya Law Reform Commission to meet the legislative requirements and deadlines stipulated in the original document. Over 40 Constitutional Bills have been enacted since 2010 including some key pieces of legislation such as The Elections Act (2011), The Political Parties Act (2011), The Transition to Devolved Government Act (2012), The County Governments Act (2012). These have been crucial in building citizen confidence in the constitution and in the democratic process in general.
