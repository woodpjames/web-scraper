Scholarships on offer to Commonwealth member states
13 June 2018
Officials working for Commonwealth governments are being invited to apply for five scholarships to help their country. Malta is allocating the oceanography grants through the Commonwealth Small States Centre of Excellence (CSSCE). They will fund a one-week course in operational oceanography for blue growth. The scholarships cover travel (capped at €1,500.00), accommodation and a daily allowance. The course will be delivered at the University of Malta in collaboration with an international panel of experts. Head of economic policy and small states at the Commonwealth, Travis Mitchell, is encouraging member states to take full advantage of the initiative. He said, “This is a fantastic opportunity for governments to improve their economic capacity and to better help their citizens. Given the urgent need to focus on protecting their oceans, reaping the full benefits of ocean-based industries and achieving economic diversification, these scholarships couldn’t have come at a better time.” Expressions of interest must be emailed to Gabriella Cassola (gabriella.cassola@gov.mt) and Wonderful Khonje (w.khonje@commonwealth.int), and must include: To be considered, eligible applicants will need to apply by Friday 15 June 2018, 17:00 (GMT +2:00).
