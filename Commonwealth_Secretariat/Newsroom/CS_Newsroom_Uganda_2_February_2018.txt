A five-day high level training programme to improve the management of Uganda’s Inspectorate of Government and Directorate of Public Prosecution has just been delivered by the Commonwealth in Jinja, Uganda.

Uganda’s Inspector General of Government, Justice Irene Mulyagonja commended the Commonwealth Secretariat for delivering an advanced and focused programme, giving senior officials a comprehensive picture of leadership from an international perspective.
