'A Peace-building Commonwealth' – our theme for 2017
6 October 2016
Peace-building will be the Commonwealth’s theme for 2017, Secretary-General Patricia Scotland announced today. The theme informs events to mark Commonwealth Day, which is celebrated on the second Monday in March, and helps to guide activities by Commonwealth organisations throughout the year. Announcing the theme at the inaugural Commonwealth Sport Summit in Edmonton, Canada, the Secretary-General stated: “At a time of increasing instability and uncertainty in the world, the Commonwealth family of nations in its rich diversity becomes an ever more-needed source of strength and hope for all its members.” ‘A Peace-building Commonwealth’ is a natural follow-on from this year’s theme of ‘An Inclusive Commonwealth’, and reaffirms the Commonwealth Charter principle that “international peace and security, sustainable economic growth and development and the rule of law are essential to the progress and prosperity of all.” In 2017, Commonwealth Day will be celebrated on 13 March. Individuals and groups are encouraged to draw inspiration from and interpret the theme in their own ways, for example by organising a community debate or art competition. Many of the more than 80 intergovernmental, professional and civil society organisations within the Commonwealth family are proactively engaged with, or contribute towards, the pursuit and strengthening of peace through their work. The Commonwealth Secretariat helps countries to build democratic institutions, hold credible and transparent elections, and promote and uphold human rights and good governance. We support nations as they seek out economic and environmental security for their citizens and deliver peace for generations to come. Find out more about the Commonwealth Theme Events and activities
