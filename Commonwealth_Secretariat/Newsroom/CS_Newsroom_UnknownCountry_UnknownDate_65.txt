Launch and expert discussion of 'Preventing Tax Base Erosion in Africa' report
UnknownDate
On Monday 17 October, a report by the Natural Resource Governance Institute (NRGI), entitled ‘Preventing Tax Base Erosion in Africa: a Regional Study of Transfer Pricing Challenges in the Mining Sector’ will receive its London launch at Marlborough House. The report is a product of a collaborative project of the NRGI, a non-governmental organisation that helps people to realise the benefits of their countries’ endowments of oil, gas and minerals, and independent researcher Alexandra Readhead. This collection of work, consisting of a report and five country case studies, assesses the development and implementation of rules to monitor transfer pricing in the mining sector, in Guinea, Ghana, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, and Zambia. It sets out a number of recommendations that would help the five case study countries, as well as other countries facing similar challenges, to better address transfer pricing risks in the mining sector through the application of the “arm’s length principle” and alternative tax policy rules. The event will include a presentation of the report, followed by a panel discussion of experts. The panel will be moderated by Dr. Ekpen Omombude, economic advisor at the Commonwealth Secretariat and Alexandra Readhead, author of the report. Confirmed panel members include:
