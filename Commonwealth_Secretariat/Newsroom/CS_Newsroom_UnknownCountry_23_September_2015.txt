New initiative launched by Commonwealth Youth Orchestra and Choir
23 September 2015
The Commonwealth Youth Orchestra and Choir (CYO) marked International Day of Peace at Marlborough House with an engaging performance by young Commonwealth musicians, overseen by Maestro Paul Carroll, Artistic Director and Composer-in Residence of the Commonwealth Orchestras and Choirs. The event also saw the launch of CYO’s new initiative: ‘Commonwealth Community Heritage, Convening the Constituency of the Commonwealth on a Path to Peace’. The objective of the initiative is to help achieve trans-national and trans-racial understanding and to build respect for diversity on a path to peace. This ties in to the theme of International Day of Peace 2015: ‘Partnerships for Peace – Dignity for All’, which aims to highlight the importance of all segments of society to work together to strive for peace. This new initiative will take the CYO’s existing partnerships to a new level. A celebration of diversity and mutual respect, the initiative will deliver national and international visibility and focus on what is being achieved by citizens of the Commonwealth through a range of activities, including a series of workshops, which will commence in October 2015. Deputy Secretary-General Gary Dunn made the Welcome Remarks about Commonwealth peace-building and Mr Robbie Lyle, President of the Friends of the Commonwealth Youth Orchestra and Choir, spoke of the importance of the ‘soft power’ of music and the opportunities for cross-border engagement and co-operation that it creates. The CYO, through its Commonwealth Music Partnership, Music for Peace and Development, links up all the music organisations, including all music genres, across the 53 countries of the Commonwealth, creating fully-funded opportunities for unique collaborations, and using music as a means of international dialogue. Keep up-to-date with the ‘Commonwealth Community Heritage, Convening the Constituency of the Commonwealth on a Path to Peace’ initiative.
