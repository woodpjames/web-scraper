The Association of Commonwealth Universities Funders Forum
UnknownDate
With the importance to development of Higher Education and university-based research increasingly gaining recognition, the Association of Commonwealth Universities is convening opportunities for conversation, dialogue and exchange between developing country universities and the funders and other organisations that work with them. The objective of this event is to enhance mutual understanding of the emerging trends within university research, research management and research funding. We look to collectively explore ways in which funders might be able to support or encourage emerging good practice in the universities they work with and ways in which universities can better support the developmental aims and objectives of the organisations that fund them. This event is by invitation only. More information on the Funders Forum series
