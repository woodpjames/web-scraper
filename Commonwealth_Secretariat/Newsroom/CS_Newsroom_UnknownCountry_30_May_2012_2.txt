Statement by Commonwealth Secretary-General Kamalesh Sharma on the Sentencing of Charles Taylor
30 May 2012
Welcoming the sentencing today by the Special Court for Sierra Leone of former Liberian leader Charles Taylor to 50 years imprisonment, Commonwealth Secretary-General Kamalesh Sharma said: “This is a most positive development, and a significant step forward by the international community in concretely upholding the international rule of law, a priority concern for the Commonwealth and its citizens. While Liberia is not a Commonwealth country, the victims of  Taylor's crimes come from Sierra Leone, one of our member states, and this verdict speaks to our core values of ensuring justice and adherence to the rule of law. “Together with our member states, the Commonwealth Secretariat is committed to ending impunity and sending a clear message that grave crimes against humanity will not be tolerated. This verdict shows the resolve of the international community to hold accountable those individuals who commit the worst crimes known to mankind, namely, war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. The Commonwealth will continue to support the work of the International Criminal Courts and Tribunals and take practical action through its worldwide network to uphold democracy and end tyranny.”
