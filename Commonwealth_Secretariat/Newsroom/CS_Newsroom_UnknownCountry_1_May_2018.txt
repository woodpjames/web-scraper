Blog: Fintech - A SWOT Analysis
1 May 2018
The term Fintech probably has not escaped you. It has emerged as the new ‘disruptive market force’ and is challenging the traditional means of providing financial services. National and International conferences everywhere are buzzing with Fintech related events and global Fintech investments have increased from $2.5 billion in 2012 to over $31 billion in 2017. But what exactly is Fintech? Simply put, Fintech stands for Financial Technologies. It refers to technological innovation in the financial sector, including anything and everything from mobile banking and peer-to-peer payments to distributed ledger technologies and digital currencies. Central Banks around the world are waking up to the immense possibilities and challenges this emerging sector poses with some of the Commonwealth countries leading work in this area. A short SWOT Analysis below highlights the many advantages and challenges of these new and emerging technologies. Strengths Weaknesses Opportunities Threats I do not think that Fintech is just a buzzword, rather it is here to stay. The wide range of technologies and their possible use under the Fintech umbrella means that all countries can benefit from the technological innovations in financial services in a way that suit their needs. This can lead to more sustainable growth by enhancing productivity and creating new markets and jobs. The main challenge is striking the right balance between regulation and promotion of this rising sector. What is your take on it?
