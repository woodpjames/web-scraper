Commonwealth represented at Kenyan presidential inauguration
10 April 2013
Uhuru Muigai Kenyatta was sworn in as Kenya's fourth President at an inauguration ceremony before a rapturous crowd of roughly 60,000 people and attended by at least a dozen African heads of state and government and other dignitaries. Kenya invited and welcomed a Commonwealth Observer Group to observe its recent general elections. The Group's report found the elections, Kenya's first under its new constitution, to have been competitive, with freedom of association and participation rights provided for.
