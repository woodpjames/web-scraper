7 May 2013
Commonwealth Secretary-General Kamalesh Sharma today issued this statement following the announcement from Buckingham Palace: It has been announced that The Queen will be represented by The Prince of Wales at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting this year. This decision reflects the wish of Her Majesty at this time in her reign to limit her long distance travel. The Queen was represented by other members of the Royal Family on a number of long-haul visits to Commonwealth countries during the celebrations of Her Majesty's Diamond Jubilee last year. The Commonwealth family of nations as a whole completely understands and respects Her Majesty's decision. We pay tribute to the continuing dedication and deep sense of duty The Queen brings to her role as Head of the Commonwealth, and to advancing our shared values as embodied in the Commonwealth Charter recently signed by Her Majesty. We warmly welcome Her Majesty’s decision to be represented by The Prince of Wales at this year's Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting reflecting as it does her unwavering devotion to the Commonwealth. The presence of The Prince of Wales at our pre-eminent Commonwealth gathering will carry forward Her Majesty’s outstanding record of enduring commitment and diligent service as Head of the Commonwealth and symbol of the free association of our nations and our peoples. There have been close links between the Commonwealth and The Prince of Wales over many years. His Royal Highness has long taken an active interest in supporting, encouraging and advancing the Commonwealth and its values. His Royal Highness has represented The Queen as Head of the Commonwealth in the past, and attended the 2007 CHOGM in Kampala, Uganda. The Prince of Wales is well known to Commonwealth leaders, and our Heads of Government will warmly welcome His Royal Highness to Colombo, Sri Lanka.
