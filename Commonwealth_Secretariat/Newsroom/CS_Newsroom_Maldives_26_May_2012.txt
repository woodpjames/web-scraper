Clarification on Commission of National Inquiry by Commonwealth Special Envoy on Maldives
26 May 2012
This report suggests that the Commonwealth Special Envoy to Maldives, Rt Hon Sir Donald McKinnon, has endorsed the Commission of National Inquiry in Maldives as "impartial, credible and broadly acceptable". This report is misleading. Sir Donald issued a clear departure statement at the conclusion of his most recent visit to Maldives on 15 May. In it, he stated that he had reached a commitment with the Government of Maldives to better focus the scope of the inquiry, strengthen the powers of the Commission of National Inquiry and broaden its composition with the participation of an international co-chair plus a nominee of former President Nasheed. Efforts to implement that understanding are still ongoing. Sir Donald has not stated that the Commission of National Inquiry as currently constituted is "impartial, credible and broadly acceptable". Indeed, his efforts while in Maldives, and since his departure have been focused on achieving that objective, so that a truly impartial, credible and broadly acceptable Commission of National Inquiry can be put in place within the agreed time-frame.
