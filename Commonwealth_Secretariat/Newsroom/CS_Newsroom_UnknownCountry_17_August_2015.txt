Calling Commonwealth Composers!
17 August 2015
Are you from the Commonwealth? Do you love composing music that reflects the culture and values of your country? If so, The Commonwealth Resounds wants to hear from you! It promotes music and musicians from across the Commonwealth – and is now launching a new project called ‘PANORPHEUS’ to celebrate its 10th anniversary. 53 short pieces will be commissioned for PANORPHEUS, one from each Commonwealth country. Talented musicians from The Commonwealth Resounds and the Royal Over-Seas League will perform them on Thursday 26 November at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in Malta. Five concerts are taking place over the course of the day. Each one will feature new musical pieces and composers from across the Commonwealth. Compositions should be submitted by 1 October 2015. To find out more about PANORPHEUS and be considered as the composer to represent your country, please contact Alison Cox, Founder and Co-Director of The Commonwealth Resounds.
