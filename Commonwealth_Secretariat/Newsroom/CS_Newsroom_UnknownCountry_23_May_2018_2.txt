23 May 2018
Heads and senior leaders of the 19 Commonwealth anti-corruption agencies in Africa have called for countries to find ways to strengthen cooperation and partnership in the tracing, recovering and the returning of assets. It follows the 8th Commonwealth Conference of Heads of Anti-Corruption Agencies in the Nigerian capital, Abuja. This year’s theme was ‘Partnering towards assets recovery and its return’. Delegates to the conference praised the Commonwealth Secretariat for developing a Commonwealth Benchmarks package to tackle corruption and raise integrity standards, as well as calling for the introduction of new laws to encourage whistle-blowing and protect those who report corruption to the authorities. They urged countries to raise public awareness about the effect of corruption, especially educating children and young people. Read the Communique
