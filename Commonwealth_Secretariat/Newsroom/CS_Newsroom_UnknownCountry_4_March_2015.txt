Durban bids to host XXII Commonwealth Games
4 March 2015
Durban's aim to host the 2022 Commonwealth Games has been warmly welcomed by the Commonwealth Secretary-General, Kamalesh Sharma at the official launch of its bid. “The Games are a showcase of Commonwealth sporting aspiration and achievement, and have been transformed in recent years with fresh enthusiasm and support. We are delighted that Durban has put its name forward to be a beacon for Commonwealth sport and our shared Commonwealth values,” the Secretary-General said at the official ceremony. “The Games are also an opportunity to celebrate and to promote the contribution of sport in creating peaceful and prosperous societies. Sixty percent of the Commonwealth’s worldwide population is under 29 years of age, and our young people are a source of energy and innovation that can be inspired by sport in general and by the Games in particular,” Mr Sharma said. “At this time of increased global challenge caused by radicalism and extremism, our Commonwealth Games are also an opportunity to highlight the inherent value and strength of diversity. By celebrating and promoting mutual respect and understanding of each other as individuals, we build stronger and more resilient communities.” “The Games are also an opportunity for the Commonwealth family of organisations to work collectively for the benefit of all Commonwealth citizens. The Games bring together sportspeople as well as business, civil society, young people and governments. They are an opportunity for our family of Commonwealth organisations as well as our athletes to unite through sport.” he said.
