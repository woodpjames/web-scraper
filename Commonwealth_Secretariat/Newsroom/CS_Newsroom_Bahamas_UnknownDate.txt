This includes: the introduction of four temporary criminal courts to deal with the backlog of cases; establishment of a bi-weekly justice coordination meeting; commitment to the establishment of case management and victims’ care Units, and a witness protection unit. However, the Attorney-General's Office currently lacks the necessary expertise to drive and sustain these initiatives to yield the desired results. Challenges facing the justice system of the Bahamas, include the following: This project seeks to address these challenges by strengthening the procedural rules and justice institutions of the Bahamas, to ensure improved access and swift justice administration and delivery. The desired changes or expected impacts of the project, by placing two senior experts in the Bahamas justice system, a criminal justice expert and a court administrative adviser, are procedural, legislative and system reforms, hitherto inhibiting administration and delivery of swift justice. The provision of knowledge transfer to local personnel will ensure a degree of sustainability and consequent succession planning within the AG’s Office and relevant agencies, notably the Department of Public Prosecution and Police.
