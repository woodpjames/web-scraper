15 May 2012
The Commonwealth Secretary-General’s Special Envoy to Maldives, Rt Hon Sir Donald McKinnon, visited Maldives from 10-15 May 2012. During his visit, Sir Donald engaged with key stakeholders to facilitate the strengthening of the Commission of National Inquiry so as to make it more impartial, credible and broadly acceptable. The Special Envoy succeeded in reaching a commitment today with the Government of Maldives to better focus the scope of inquiry, strengthen the powers of the Commission and broaden its composition with the participation of an international Co-Chair plus a nominee of former President Nasheed. Sir Donald said: “The Commonwealth wants to support an independent and impartial Inquiry Commission that helps the people of Maldives address the events of 7 February 2012 in a manner that moves the country forward in its democratic journey. Our efforts today have paved the way for such an effort. I look forward to former President Nasheed confirming a suitable candidate to join this Commission by the time it begins its work on 1 June 2012.” Note to Editors: The Commonwealth Secretary-General, Kamalesh Sharma, appointed the Rt Hon Sir Donald McKinnon as his Special Envoy to Maldives on 1 March 2012.
