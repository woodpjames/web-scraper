Commonwealth Secretary-General commends Kenyans on peaceful poll
13 March 2013
In a letter dated 13 March, Mr Sharma noted that last week’s elections were Kenya’s first under the country’s new constitution and associated legislation. He said the elections represented a critical step in the democratisation, reform and devolution process to which the Commonwealth contributed over the last few years, including through the provision of expertise. Mr Sharma said: “I take the opportunity to congratulate the people and authorities of Kenya for the popular and peaceful conduct of the elections, which were an important and successful test for the country and its institutions. I am encouraged by the evident commitment to resolve any disputes arising out of these elections through established legal channels.” A Commonwealth Observer Group led by former Botswana President Festus Mogae was present in Kenya prior to, during and after the elections. In an interim statement issued on 6 March, Mr Mogae also praised Kenyans for a peaceful poll. The Group will issue a final report on the elections in due course. Download the Interim Statement
