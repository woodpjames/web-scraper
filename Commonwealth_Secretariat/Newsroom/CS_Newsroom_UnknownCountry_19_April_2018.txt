19 April 2018
Commonwealth heads have met in executive session at Lancaster House in London today. They discussed how they could collectively tackle global and Commonwealth challenges. The Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) heard about the work which has been carried out by the Commonwealth Secretariat on behalf of the 53 member states and 2.4 billion citizens. Leaders heard about the need to collaborate to tackle the existential threat of climate change, encouraged to adopt the Commonwealth Blue Charter on ocean governance and the importance and benefits of trading together. Tomorrow the Commonwealth heads will meet at the CHOGM retreat to decide the priorities for the next two years. The theme for this year's CHOGM is 'Towards a Common Future', seeking a fairer, more sustainable, prosperous and secure future.
