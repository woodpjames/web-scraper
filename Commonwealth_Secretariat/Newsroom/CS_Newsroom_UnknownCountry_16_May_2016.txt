International Day against Homophobia, Biphobia and Transphobia
16 May 2016
The vision of the Commonwealth Secretariat is to help create and sustain a Commonwealth that is mutually respectful, resilient, peaceful and prosperous and that cherishes equality, diversity and shared values. To achieve this we actively support member governments and partner with the broader Commonwealth family and others to improve the well-being of all Commonwealth citizens and to advance their shared interests globally. Our approach is always to promote equality and inclusiveness, and to eliminate prejudice and intolerance. Just as we would not discriminate on the basis of race, age, colour or belief, or any other grounds, neither is it acceptable to discriminate on grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity. To enjoy a wealth that is truly common we need to build our social capital. That means each individual enjoying the right to truly be themselves and the freedom to give of their best. Indeed our Charter affirms that ‘diversity and understanding the richness of our multiple identities are fundamental to the Commonwealth’s principles and approach’. Our hope and aim on this International Day against Homophobia, Biphobia and Transphobia and every day is for all communities in the Commonwealth to be places that welcome, enable and encourage everyone to lead lives that are fulfilling and free from fear and discrimination.
