South Asia floods: Secretary-General expresses solidarity
2 September 2017
Devastating floods across South Asia are estimated to have claimed more than 1,200 lives, as heavy rains which earlier affected India and Bangladesh have now hit Pakistan. According to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), some 40 million people across the region have been affected. In the latest developments, flash flooding in Karachi, Pakistan, has reported to have claimed the lives of 16 people, including several children. Meanwhile, in Mumbai, India, a six storey building collapsed killing 33 people. Commonwealth Secretary-General Patricia Scotland offered the Commonwealth’s support to governments across South Asia and sent her condolences to the victims and their families. “These floods are another tragic reminder of the ferocity of natural disasters. My heart goes out to everyone affected including those who have lost loved ones and who have been displaced,” she said. “We stand in solidarity with the governments and peoples of South Asia and urge all Commonwealth member states and international partners to do everything possible to assist with both the relief effort and the rebuilding to come.”
