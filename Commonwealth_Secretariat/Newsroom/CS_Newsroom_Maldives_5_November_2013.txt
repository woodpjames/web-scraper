Statement by the Commonwealth Secretary-General’s Special Envoy To Maldives, Sir Don McKinnon
5 November 2013
The Commonwealth Secretary-General’s Special Envoy, Sir Donald McKinnon, has been in Maldives since 3 November. He has held discussions with a number of Maldivian stakeholders, including a long interaction with the Elections Commission. “I come here as a longstanding friend of Maldives, to play my part in assisting the Maldivian people to have a free, fair and credible election.” “The election held on 7 September 2013 went very well, as noted by domestic and international observers, and I am confident that a successful election can also take place on 9 November.” Sir Don noted that the high voter turnout, of 88 per cent, for the 7 September election demonstrates that the Maldivian people want their voices to be heard. “There is no reason for the 9 November election not to go smoothly if everyone plays their part in supporting the electoral process. This is the time that all political leaders must act in the utmost of good faith to allow the elections to proceed freely, fairly and calmly.”
