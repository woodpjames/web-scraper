Education Hub e-discussion: 'Changing Patterns in Boys' Educational Achievement – What Can We Do To Make Things Better?'
UnknownDate
Hosted in partnership with United Nations Girls' Education Initiative (UNGEI), the e-discussion will bring together practitioners, academics and policymakers to debate how the education system can better address the interests of boys and male adolescents and allow them to reach their potential, as well as exercise their right to education. Participants will be encouraged to look at related issues and risk factors, as well as strategies to address these (e.g. effective policies, programmes and projects), and ways of scaling-up and adapting existing and promising practices. To join the discussion please visit the Education Hub and join the Community of Practice or alternatively email your contribution. We look forward to your participation.
