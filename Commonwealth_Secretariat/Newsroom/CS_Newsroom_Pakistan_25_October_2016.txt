Secretary-General expresses solidarity after Pakistan police academy attack
25 October 2016
Commonwealth Secretary-General Patricia Scotland expressed her shock and profound sadness on hearing of Monday night’s attack on a police academy in Quetta, Pakistan, which has claimed at least 59 lives. Militants reportedly attacked the Balochistan Police College wearing suicide vests and carrying Kalashnikovs. Many of those who died were young cadets, said local officials. “The whole Commonwealth family will be united today in grief and revulsion at this terrifying attack,” said Secretary-General Scotland. “We offer our deepest sympathies to the victims and families of those affected and our solidarity to the people and government of Pakistan at this challenging time.” “By targeting young police recruits in this cruel and callous way, the perpetrators merely stiffen the resolve of all governments to counter violent extremism and strengthen core Commonwealth values such as the commitment to peace, the rule of law, and human rights.”
