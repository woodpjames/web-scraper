Prince Charles attends Commonwealth Sustainable Cities Network Conference
12 July 2016
The Prince of Wales attended the Commonwealth Local Government Forum's (CLGF) Annual Reception, meeting with delegates to hear about issues around sustainability and urbanisation during the CLGF's second Commonwealth Sustainable Cities Network (CSCN) conference at Marlborough House this evening. The CSCN was set up in 2015, to focus on the support needed by cities across the Commonwealth to meet the Sustainable Development Goals and deal with the challenges resulting from increasing urbanisation. This is the second meeting of the network and will determine its work and future direction helping to formulate discussions in the run-up to the Habitat III Conference and The World Assembly of Local and Regional Governments. The focus of today's meeting was on building successful, safe and sustainable cities, and on making cities fit for the future. The degree of urbanisation varies significantly in the 53 member states of the Commonwealth, but everywhere urbanisation is growing rapidly and the number of cities increasing. Those attending and speaking included mayors and ministers from across the Commonwealth, as well as Commonwealth and other international organisations and partners with an interest in cities and urban issues including: the International Sustainability Unit, established by The Prince of Wales; and The Prince's Foundation for Building Community.
