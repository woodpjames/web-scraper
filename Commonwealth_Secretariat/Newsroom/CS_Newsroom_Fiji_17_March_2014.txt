Fiji flag flies again following Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group decision
17 March 2014
The flag of the Republic of Fiji went up at the Commonwealth Secretariat gardens in London, following a positive decision to change the status of the country's membership in the organisation. At the 43rd meeting of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG) in London on 14 March 2014, CMAG "decided that Fiji's current full suspension from the Commonwealth should be changed to suspension from the councils of the Commonwealth, thus permitting Fiji once again to participate in a range of Commonwealth activities, including the Commonwealth Games, recognising the role of sport in bringing people together".
