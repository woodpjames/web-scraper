Commonwealth Secretary-General Patricia Scotland has expressed her deep sorrow at the passing of Vanuatu’s President Baldwin Lonsdale, who is said to have died in Port Vila after a short illness. “I was deeply saddened to learn of the death of President Lonsdale, who had been serving the people of Vanuatu since September 2014. I extend my deepest condolences to his family and I stand in solidarity with the  government and people of Vanuatu as they mourn the death of their dedicated and beloved leader,” said the Secretary-General. She continued, “President Lonsdale was an exemplary leader, and a guardian of the pillars of justice, democracy and integrity. He would be remembered as a man who refused to tolerate corruption and who made an unmovable stand to uphold the rule of law and against the abuse of power. The ripples of his actions during his time in office made waves across the region, and his leadership was a testimony of his deep love and commitment to his country and to his people.” Secretary-General Scotland’s tribute on behalf of the Commonwealth comes as the people of Vanuatu pay their respect to their late head of state.
