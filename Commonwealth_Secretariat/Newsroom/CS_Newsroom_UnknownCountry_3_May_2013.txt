World Press Freedom Day message
3 May 2013
Commonwealth leaders have consistently reaffirmed their commitment to promoting the fundamental values and principles of the Commonwealth family, and those values and principles include freedom of expression and freedom of the press. At the Commonwealth, our priority remains to continue working with member states to assist them in observing what they agreed to do and translating commitments into solid action. A free and responsible press is an absolute prerequisite for a properly functioning democracy. We shall continue to support the development of responsible and professional journalism, while at the same time working to ensure that there is a conducive political, legal and economic environment from which journalists can operate.
