13 March 2014
Commonwealth Secretary-General Kamalesh Sharma has expressed his profound sadness at the passing today of Dr Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, former President of Sierra Leone. Dr Kabbah was 82. In a statement issued in London, Mr Sharma said: "On behalf of the Commonwealth family, I would like to convey our deepest condolences to the family of Dr Kabbah, to the Government and people of Sierra Leone. “Former President Kabbah was a strong supporter of the Commonwealth, in upholding its fundamental values of democracy, development and respect for diversity. Our membership benefited immensely from his active participation at various summits and during other Commonwealth initiatives. He led Commonwealth election observers to elections in Kenya in 2007, where he personally initiated dialogue with various political actors when violence broke out following those elections. He also led the Commonwealth Observer Group to elections in Mozambique in 2009.” The Secretary General added: “President Kabbah was a true son of Africa. He was a man of peace who steered Sierra Leone positively following many years of civil war, and brought the country back from the brink. The Commonwealth is pleased to have worked closely with him and his government during those difficult periods. “His death is a great loss to Africa, to the Commonwealth and the international community.”
