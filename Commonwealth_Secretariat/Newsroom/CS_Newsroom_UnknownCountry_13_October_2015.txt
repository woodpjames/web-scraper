13 October 2015
The Commonwealth Secretariat is pleased to announce the Indian Government's generous offer of 75 places under the 2015-2016 Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation (ITEC) Programme. These are reserved specifically for applicants from Commonwealth member countries. Created to offer training, share expertise and best practices with member countries to build capacity, transfer technology and develop human capital facilitating long-term, sustainable growth, the ITEC Civilian Training Programme has been running successfully for over 50 years. It forms an integral part of India’s development partnership and cooperation with the developing world. The Programme trains nearly 5000 participants per year. There are 47 premier institutions conducting 280 unique training courses of short, medium and long-term duration in diverse fields such as audit, banking, information technology, telecommunications, management, SME/rural development, renewable energy and other specialised disciplines. Commonwealth Deputy Secretary-General Deodat Maharaj encourages Commonwealth member countries to take advantage of this excellent opportunity, stating: “I believe this programme is a good example of how bilateral technical cooperation provides an opportunity to build key skills and technical capacity which will contribute to increasing national capacities in many developing countries in the Commonwealth.” The Indian Government offers full sponsorship for all successful applicants of the scheme. The Commonwealth Secretariat welcomes applications from interested, eligible individuals. For further information, see Third country programmes
