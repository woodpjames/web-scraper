Strengthening the Magistrates Court System of Namibia
UnknownDate
Long delays in the criminal justice area were experienced due to the poor performance of magistrates. The need to increase the capacity of the magistrates and the magistrates' court system was therefore identified as a national development priority by the Government of Namibia. The goal of this project was to build the capacity of magistrates and strengthen the Magistrates’ Court System in Namibia in order to create a stronger, more effective judicial process in Namibia. The project provided mentoring to magistrates and strengthened the operations of the Magistrates' Court System. This would ultimately lead to a well-trained and efficient group of magistrates and a court system that is able to deliver timely judgments in a competent manner and within an effectively functioning Magistrates’ Court System. Ultimately, the people of Namibia will benefit from a court system that is better able to deal with proceedings in the timely and fair manner that is expected.
