Clean sweep for Commonwealth as Fiji win historic gold at Olympic Rugby 7s
12 August 2016
Commonwealth Secretary-General Patricia Scotland congratulated Fiji’s gold medal winning Rugby Sevens team for their success at the Rio Olympic Games. The team secured the country’s first ever Olympic medal yesterday with victory over Great Britain, winning by 43 points to seven. Secretary-General Scotland said: “I was thrilled to see Fiji triumph at the Olympics and know how much this means to such a rugby-loving country. I’m sure the pride I felt at seeing this Commonwealth nation achieve greatness will be shared by everyone in Fiji. This historical achievement is a testament to the skill, grit and determination of a proud nation. “Fiji’s win is an inspiration to all small island states across the Commonwealth, proving that you don’t have to be the largest country to be the greatest. The Fijian win was celebrated by British and Fijian fans alike and demonstrated Commonwealth family’s affection for each other. Have a great celebration – you’ve earned it!”
