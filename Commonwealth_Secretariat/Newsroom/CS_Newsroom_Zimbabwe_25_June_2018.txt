25 June 2018
Following the explosion on Saturday 23 June at an election rally in Bulawayo, a spokesperson for the Commonwealth Secretariat said, "Our thoughts are with the people of Zimbabwe. We are deeply saddened to hear of the loss of life and injuries caused by the attack, and wish all who have been hurt or affected in any way a speedy recovery. "We condemn in the strongest terms this violent attack. At the end of next month, the people of Zimbabwe will participate in the highly important democratic processes of electing a president and members of parliament. "Violence of this kind should not be allowed to interfere with the fundamental freedom of candidates and members of all political parties to campaign and engage with voters, and the right of all citizens participate freely and safely in the political gatherings. We trust the leaders of all political parties will work together in a spirit of respect and mutual protection towards the goal of elections that are peaceful, free and fair."
