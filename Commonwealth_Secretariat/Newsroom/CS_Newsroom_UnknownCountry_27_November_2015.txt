Baroness Scotland was selected Commonwealth Secretary-General this afternoon at the Commonwealth summit in Malta. The selection of the new Secretary-General took place in a closed session during the 24th biennial Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM). The process was overseen by the CHOGM Chair and the Prime Minister of Malta Joseph Muscat. Baroness Scotland said: "The Commonwealth shares a great deal. It has 33 per cent of the world's population. It has the capacity to bring together people of all religions; concentrate on what joins us. It's a real opportunity to invest and work together. If you work together with people respectfully, you can bring about change. Human rights and development go hand-in-hand." Patricia Scotland will be the sixth Commonwealth Secretary-General and the first woman to take up this post.
