Youth Forum Statement presented to ministers at the 18th Conference of Commonwealth Education Ministers in Mauritius
30 August 2012
We, the young people of the Commonwealth, representing a range of cultures, religions, educational backgrounds, experience and regions, believe that education should prepare young people to face challenges, both academically and socially. Furthermore, we reaffirm the statement from the 18CCEM youth delegates that education is a right for all and not a privilege. We, the delegates of the 18CCEM Youth Forum, recommend the following: We believe student participation in decision-making, especially in education, should be integral and meaningful to the process. Therefore, we call for endorsement and support from Commonwealth ministers of education and youth, and all other Commonwealth education stakeholders, for the creation of the new Commonwealth Student Association, which will be a definitive voice of students in the Commonwealth. We, the delegates of the 18CCEM Youth Forum, express our appreciation of the opportunity to participate in the forum, and to contribute to the future of education in the Commonwealth.
