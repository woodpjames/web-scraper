Commonwealth Secretary-General in Addis Ababa for the African Union Summit
29 January 2012
Commonwealth Secretary-General Kamalesh Sharma arrived in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa on 28 January 2012 to attend the 18th summit of the African Union, where he is expected to meet a number of Commonwealth Heads of Government and foreign ministers. Soon after his arrival, Mr Sharma met Swaziland's Prime Minister Dr Sibusiso Barnabas Dlamini, for discussions on current global, Commonwealth and national priorities, including the Commonwealth's role in addressing emerging challenges. The Secretary-General and Prime Minister agreed on a number of areas where the Commonwealth will deliver new programmes of technical assistance. This is expected to focus on support for Swaziland's economic development (including the provision of macroeconomic advice and experts to help strengthen the public service), as well as support to develop and strengthen national institutions established under the country's constitution (including the Electoral Commission and Human Rights Commission). The Secretary-General also briefed the Prime Minister on the Commonwealth Secretariat's efforts to advance reform and renewal of the association as agreed by Commonwealth leaders at their 2011 Heads of Government meeting in Perth, Australia. Later on 28 January, the Secretary-General attended the inauguration of the new African Union Commission Conference and Office Complex.
