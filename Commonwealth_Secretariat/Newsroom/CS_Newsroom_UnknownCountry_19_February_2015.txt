World Day of Social Justice           - 20 February
19 February 2015
The focus of World Day of Social Justice is on principles that are at the heart of the Commonwealth approach to advancing democracy, development, and respect for diversity. The Commonwealth Charter sets out the collective commitment of Commonwealth member states to principles of consensus and common action, mutual respect, inclusiveness, transparency, accountability, legitimacy, and responsiveness. It reaffirms the commitment of our member states to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and to equality and respect for the protection and promotion of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights. We are implacably opposed to all forms of discrimination, whether rooted in gender, race, colour, creed, political belief or other grounds. Our Charter also stresses the importance to the Commonwealth of sustainable economic and social transformation to eliminate poverty and meet the basic needs of the vast majority of the people of the world. It affirms that economic and social progress enhance the sustainability of democracy, and the value of technical assistance, capacity building and practical cooperation in promoting development. Member states of the Commonwealth work together offering mutual support in a spirit of respect and understanding towards removing wide disparities and unequal living standards as guided by internationally agreed development goals, to build economic resilience, and to promote social equity. We are united in our determination to continue doing so.
