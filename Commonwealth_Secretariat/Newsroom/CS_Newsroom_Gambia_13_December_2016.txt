Secretary-General encourages continuation of peaceful, constitutional and dignified transition in The Gambia
13 December 2016
The Commonwealth Secretary-General, Patricia Scotland, urges the democratic will of the people of The Gambia to be respected, and encourages the continuation of the peaceful, constitutional and dignified transition that has already commenced following the 1 December election. The Secretary-General also notes that any challenge to the election outcome should, in any circumstances, be compliant with the rule of law. The Secretary-General supports the ongoing efforts of ECOWAS, the African Union and the United Nations in urging the leadership of The Gambia to continue the democratic transition it has begun. Note to editors The Gambia withdrew from the Commonwealth on 3 October 2013. At the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Colombo, Sri Lanka in November 2013, the association’s leaders collectively noted The Gambia’s withdrawal with regret and urged the Commonwealth Secretariat to remain in contact with The Gambia to encourage its eventual return.
