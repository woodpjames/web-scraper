Outcomes of The Commonwealth and Francophonie Dialogue with the G20
11 April 2014
Members of The Commonwealth and La Francophonie (CF) held a Dialogue with Australia, President of the G20 in 2014 and several members of the G20 Development Working Group (DWG) in Washington DC on 7th April 2014. We welcomed Australiaâ€™s initiative to hold the fourth Annual Dialogue, which has contributed to a further deepening of dialogue and engagement between the three associations, enabling the perspectives and priority development challenges of many of the poorest, smallest and most vulnerable developing countries to be discussed and brought to the attention of the DWG. Participants included over 20 developing country members of The Commonwealth and Francophonie, from Africa, Asia, the Pacific and the Caribbean regions, 12 G20 member countries, the European Union and several international organisations including the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, ODI, DFI, WFP, IFAD, OECD and the G24. We welcomed the discussion and valued suggestions by members on where the G20 DWG might best support developing countries in generating resilient growth and employment in the context of sustainable development and the challenges presented by the global economy. Participants highlighted the importance of continued engagement with the G20, and discussed the importance of taking stock of it and how the G20 has taken account of input provided through this dialogue.
