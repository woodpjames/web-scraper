19 May 2016
Commonwealth Secretary-General Patricia Scotland today expressed her profound concern for the victims of landslides in Sri Lanka, following torrential rain. More than 200 people are reportedly unaccounted for, several bodies have been found, and thousands have been displaced, following mudslides in the country’s central Kegalle district. “Our thoughts are with all those in Sri Lanka who have been affected by the devastating landslides caused by heavy rainfall. On behalf of the Commonwealth I offer our condolences and deep sympathy to the Government and people of Sri Lanka, particularly to families and friends grieving the loss of loved ones, and all who are suffering physical and mental trauma as a result of this catastrophe.” the Secretary-General said in a statement. “The focus now must be on the recovery effort to help the families and communities who have been caught up so terribly in this tragedy. The entire Commonwealth family offers its thanks and appreciation to the rescue workers who are performing heroic acts in very challenging conditions. “As we extend our deepest sympathies to the Sri Lankan people and its government, we recognise that the effects of this disaster will continue to have an impact for many months and years to come. I am calling on the Commonwealth family to provide support to Sri Lanka through coordinated assistance in the aftermath of this tragedy.”  Aid is delivered for the victims of Sri Lanka's landslides (Credit: RCS Sri Lanka)
