Reviewing youth entrepreneurship in West and Southern Africa
UnknownDate
The Commonwealth Secretariat works with member governments and young entrepreneurs to create an enabling environment in which youth entrepreneurship can flourish. In 2015 the Secretariat developed a Policy Guide on Youth Entrepreneurship in collaboration with UNCTAD. This Guide was launched at the 2015 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, during the Commonwealth Business Forum. The 'Technical Workshop on developing a National Youth Entrepreneurship Policy' will be delivered jointly by the Secretariat, UNCTAD and the Government of South Africa. The workshop will see senior officials, young entrepreneurs and other relevant authorities from Commonwealth countries in West and Southern Africa gather to review and analyse the current state of youth entrepreneurship in the region, identify existing challenges and opportunities, and share good practices and policies, with the Commonwealth-UNCTAD Policy Guide serving as a foundation. Delegates will also discuss issues of youth employment in their region and countries, and existing policies, programmes and tools. Olalekan Oshunkoya of #Nigeria (#CAYE) is a young entrepreneur.
