Commonwealth statement for International Youth Day 2014
12 August 2014
Today is an important moment for the world to pause and reflect upon the enormous contribution young people across the world make to national progress, and to local communities. The theme for International Youth Day this year is ‘Youth and Mental Health’. This presents a welcome opportunity for us to consider a subject which is still taboo in too many Commonwealth countries. Conversations about mental health are often clouded by misunderstanding and stigma, which in turn can lead to the isolation and alienation of vulnerable young adults and adolescents. This is too serious an issue for us to ignore, especially when we consider that among young people, suicide is one of the most common cause of deaths. Many young people already endure pervasive inequality and face obstacles to their full participation in economic, social and political spheres of life. Persistent unemployment, poverty and marginalisation all have an impact on their psychological resilience. Poor mental health can be a symptom of the circumstances of young people’s lives, or stem from physiology; often it is a combination of both. Today, the Commonwealth recognises the importance of these young people being able to live full and happy lives, with proper support and without stigma. The Commonwealth also stands with young people, youth councils, schools and universities, faith groups, employers and families, to recognise the important work of the youth workers, and also the mental health charities and public health professionals, who support these young people. The Commonwealth believes that young people are assets to their societies, with a proven capability to lead change.  That is why we are advocating for there to be a clear recognition of the importance of young people’s development, empowerment and participation as part of the new post 2015 global development agenda.
