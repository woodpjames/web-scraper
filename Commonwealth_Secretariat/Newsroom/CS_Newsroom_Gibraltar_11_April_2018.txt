11 April 2018
Gibraltar, a British Overseas Territory, has produced a postage stamp to honour the United Kingdom as the Chair of the 2018 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM). In tandem, it will mark Gibraltar as Chair of the Conference of Commonwealth Postal Administrations (CCPA). The Gibraltar-issue stamp will be launched on the last day of CHOGM, April 20, at the Scottish Congress Philatelic Exhibition in Perth, Scotland. The stamp celebrates the family of 53 Commonwealth countries in their diversity and geographical spread and reaffirms their commitment to the Commonwealth’s shared fundamental values and principles. David Ledger, Chief Executive Officer of the Royal Gibraltar Post Office said: “We are delighted to be honouring the shared values and principles of Commonwealth through this Commonwealth stamp.”
