24 November 2015
Businesswoman Valrie Grant was awarded Commonwealth Women Entrepreneur of the Year at a gala dinner and ceremony to mark the first ever Commonwealth Women’s Forum. The geospatial analyst, whose company GeoTechVision has been assisting Caribbean businesses, agencies and government ministries with Geographic Information Systems and GPS products and solutions, was given the accolade last night by the Commonwealth Businesswomen’s Network (CBW). “Ms Grant impressed the judging panel for several reasons, including the fact that she owns and operates her business successfully internationally in a male dominated field. She supports other female entrepreneurs helping them to see how they too can strive to be better. She is always striving to innovate and she is truly passionate about what she does,” said Arif Zaman, CBW Executive Director. The award was made in one of nine categories which recognised entrepreneurs and business leaders from across the Commonwealth. CBN also named Commonwealth Secretary-General Kamalesh Sharma 1st Commonwealth Male Champion of Change in recognition of his leadership on gender mainstreaming - which encourages policy makers to consider the impact of legislations, policies and programmes on women.
