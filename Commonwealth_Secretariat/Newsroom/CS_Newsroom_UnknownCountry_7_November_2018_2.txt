Princess Anne unveils Edmonton Commonwealth Walkway
7 November 2018
Walkers don't need any encouragement to visit one of the most picturesque parts of Edmonton, Canada, but the Commonwealth is providing an added incentive. The Edmonton Commonwealth Walkway will encourage people to get moving and enjoy the North Saskatchewan river valley while exploring Edmonton’s history and heritage as well as Canada’s connections to the Commonwealth. The Princess Royal, Princess Anne, was in Edmonton, capital of the province of Alberta, to launch the initiative.  She was joined by the Lieutenant Governor of Alberta, Lois Mitchell, and the Commonwealth Secretary-General, Patricia Scotland, at a ceremony to announce the new walkway. “Commonwealth Walkways are a way to honour the longstanding service of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II and to celebrate the shared values of democracy, human rights and the rule of law that unite Commonwealth nations,” said Lt. Governor Mitchell. Bronze route markers bearing the Queen's personal cypher will be positioned along existing trails. Each marker will represent a chapter or story in Edmonton’s history.  Princess Anne unveiled one of the markers in the presence of residents and visitors from all over the world who are attending the 28th Commonwealth Agriculture conference in Edmonton. A mobile app will share stories and guide users along the trail. The stories will be developed in consultation with community representatives, including First Nations and Metis groups. This is the Commonwealth Secretary-General’s second official visit to Alberta. "I pay tribute to Alberta for its stalwart support for the Commonwealth in so many ways.” she said.  "I was here just over a year ago for the opening of the Commonwealth Walkway in Banff.  Alberta, you truly walk the Commonwealth walk!" The Edmonton Commonwealth Walkway is funded by private donors and gifts in kind and is expected to open in the summer of 2019.
