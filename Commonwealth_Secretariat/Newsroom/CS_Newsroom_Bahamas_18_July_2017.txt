Bahamas gospel choir rocks Commonwealth London headquarters
18 July 2017
Commonwealth high commissioners and staff were recently treated to a powerful performance from the multi-award winning Bahamas gospel group, Shaback. The choir, which celebrated its 20th anniversary last year, greeted staff and high commissioners arriving at the Commonwealth’s London headquarters for the launch of its Office for Civil and Criminal Justice Reform. Describing the performance as inspirational and “a wonderful expression of our unity”, Secretary-General Patricia Scotland thanked Shaback for bringing the cheerful and uplifting Bahamian spirit to the Secretariat. She told members of the thirty-strong choir, “The Bahamas is a glittering jewel in the Caribbean. I am incredibly proud to have the spirit of the Caribbean permeate these walls.” Speaking at the event, The Bahamas’ High Commissioner, Eldred Bethel, pointed out that the country’s constitution was signed at Commonwealth Headquarters in 1972.  The Secretary-General acknowledged that the event would be Mr Bethel’s last. He is due to relinquish his post on 31 July. The choir was visiting the UK to help celebrate the 44th anniversary of The Bahamas’ independence.
