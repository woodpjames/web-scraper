UnknownDate
The Youth Leaders Forum of the 9th Commonwealth Youth Ministers Meeting (9CYMM) provides a space for young leaders from Commonwealth member countries to influence and shape the global debate on youth development. Held in Kampala, Uganda, between 31 July and 1 August 2017, the forum takes place before the ministerial summit. This year’s theme is Resourcing and Financing Youth Development: Empowering Young People. For participants, the meeting provides the opportunity to influence critical decision-makers in the youth development sector and engage with ministers of youth and senior government officials. The forum brings together a diverse range of youth-led organisations, stakeholders and development partners. During the Youth Leaders Forum, delegates will review the outcomes of past meetings, make recommendations to ministers, and propose areas of focus for the 2018 Commonwealth Youth Forum, which precedes the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in London, United Kingdom. The Youth Leaders Forum is led by the Commonwealth Youth Council and the Uganda National Youth Council, with support from the Commonwealth Secretariat and Government of Uganda.
