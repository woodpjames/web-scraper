Commonwealth International Tax Roundtable
UnknownDate
The Commonwealth Secretariat will be hosting an international tax roundtable in London on 20-21 June. The two-day meeting will bring together senior officials from small state International Financial Centres (IFCs), which include countries or jurisdictions with a concentration of financial intermediaries that offer a range of services to non-residents, to discuss recent developments in global taxation policies and regulations. In the past, the Commonwealth has provided a forum for its small state IFCs to share perspectives and address emerging concerns about tax transparency and regulation. In light of recent developments, and the potential implications for its members, the Commonwealth roundtable will provide a unique opportunity for jurisdictions across the Commonwealth that host IFCs to come together and consider the best way forward.
