Hate speech, and how to deal with it
7 December 2017
Training for youth leaders aimed at countering violent radicalisation among young people will be delivered next week, 11-15 December, at Marlborough House, London. Run by the Commonwealth Secretariat and Council of Europe, the five-day course will empower young leaders and youth workers from member states to develop ways to combat hate speech, and strengthen support for human rights through non-formal education and awareness-raising actions. Mark Albon, head of Countering Violent Extremism at the Commonwealth Secretariat said, “Hate and intolerance are the currency of violent extremism. We must make it ‘our common cause’ to offer strong alternative narratives that emphasise people’s fundamental human rights, build inclusivity in our societies and diminish the efforts of those who would seek to sow division and discord across the world.” The No Hate Speech Movement is a youth campaign of the Council of Europe to promote human rights online and take action against hate speech. The training will bring together 37 participants aged between 19 and 30 from across 22 Commonwealth countries, with many cultures and faiths or those of none represented. The delegates are youth workers, activists, teachers, policy officers, lawyers and government officials. The training is based on the Council of Europe’s manual ‘Bookmarks combatting hate speech through human rights education’ and ‘We CAN! Taking action on hate speech through counter- and alternative narratives’. Mansi Arun Panjwani from India and Ilaria Esposito from Italy, both experienced trainers in addressing hate speech and human rights education, will be leading the activity.
