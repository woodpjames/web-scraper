Zambia’s 2011 elections meet many of the benchmarks for democratic elections
22 September 2011
The Commonwealth Observer Group said the 2011 elections represent further progress for Zambia in strengthening its democratic processes. However, there are shortcomings which need to be addressed. Presenting the team’s Interim Statement on the pre-election and election day processes, General Yakubu Gowon, Chair of the Commonwealth Observer Group, said the elections were competitive, the campaign was generally peaceful, election day was largely calm, well organised and with voters able to express their will freely. However the team also noted the misuse of state resources and the failure to provide fair and balanced news coverage by significant sections of the media. The team also expressed disappointment at the very low number of women candidates for the elections.
