Sing for the Commonwealth - Commonwealth Choir Competitions 2016
22 September 2016
Two Commonwealth music competitions have been launched by the Commonwealth Youth Orchestra (CYO) & Choir to mark and celebrate International Day of Peace 2016. Commonwealth Secretary-General Scotland provided a warm message of support, stating: "The Commonwealth Youth Orchestra's Music For Peace and Development Programme shows the power of music as the medium for spreading peace and goodwill across boundaries of language, culture and geographical location." She added: "At a time when global security and stability may seem fragile, it is more important than ever for us to come together to celebrate and build on the positive values we share as a Commonwealth family."  Winners of the competitions will be announced in London on Commonwealth Day, Monday 13 March 2017 at 'Sing for the Commonwealth 2017 – Music for Peace & Development'. This annual musical event is presented and produced by The Commonwealth Youth Orchestra and Choir’s Commonwealth Music Hub and will be live-streamed.
