25 October 2017
A Commonwealth spokesperson said, "We are sending a mission to Kenya. Commonwealth staff are already on the ground. The mission will be led by former President Rupiah Banda of Zambia. Commonwealth Secretary-General Patricia Scotland is clear that whatever the position, we will need peaceful dialogue and having friends of Kenya in situ will help to ensure that happens."
