Education hub launched in Bahamas
27 June 2015
The Commonwealth has launched its first knowledge-sharing network to help facilitate dialogue on education across member countries. The website www.thecommonwealth-educationhub.net went live on Friday 26 June with a wealth of resources, best practice examples and country reports. The community of practice edu-hub@groups.thecommonwealth.info has run two pilot discussions since it began at the start of June with contributions from every Commonwealth region. Secretary-General Kamalesh Sharma described the hub as a “Virtual one-stop shop knowledge service for education professionals and planners”. At the launch, which took place at the 19th Conference of Commonwealth Education Ministers in The Bahamas, Commonwealth Deputy Secretary-General said: “The Hub is not only a way to promote knowledge-sharing among policy-makers and practitioners, but also acts as a ‘network of networks’ that can create an enabling context for solutions and best practices to be adopted for scale across the Commonwealth.”
