Commonwealth observers return to Maldives for 9 November presidential election
 6 November 2013
As part of the Commonwealth’s continuing support of Maldives a Commonwealth Observer Group will once again be in the country to observe the 9 November presidential election. Dr Lawrence Gonzi, former Prime Minister of Malta, is again leading the eight-member observer group for the election. Announcing the mission in London, Commonwealth Secretary-General Kamalesh Sharma said: “This is the fourth occasion in nine weeks that Maldives is seeking to hold an election. The Maldivian people deserve to elect their President without further delay or impediments.” A Commonwealth Observer Group first deployed to the country at the invitation of the Elections Commission of Maldives for the 7 September presidential election, which was later annulled by the country’s Supreme Court. The Commonwealth Secretary–General subsequently constituted observer groups for the 28 September and the 19 October elections, both of which were eventually cancelled. Dr Gonzi led the group on each occasion. The Commonwealth Observer Group observes and considers all aspects of the electoral process and assesses compliance with the standards for democratic elections to which Maldives has committed itself. Where appropriate, the group can also make recommendations for the future strengthening of the electoral framework. Commonwealth Observer Groups act impartially and independently and conduct themselves according to the standards expressed in the International Declaration of Principles for Election Observation, to which the Commonwealth is a signatory. The Commonwealth Observer Group to the 2013 Maldives elections will present its final report to the Commonwealth Secretary-General, who will in turn send it to the Government of Maldives, the Elections Commission of Maldives, Maldivian political parties and eventually to all Commonwealth governments. It will then be made public. The eight-member Commonwealth Observer Group will be in Malé from 6 to 16 November. If a second round election is required on 16 November, the Commonwealth will maintain an appropriate presence in Malé for that purpose.  Officials of the Commonwealth Secretariat are supporting the Commonwealth Observer Group.
