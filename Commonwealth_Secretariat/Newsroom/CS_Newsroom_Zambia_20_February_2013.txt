Statement by the Commonwealth Spokesperson on Zambia
20 February 2013
The Commonwealth Secretariat is in touch with the Zambian Government on this matter and will also be consulting appropriately with other stakeholders in Zambia. The Commonwealth Secretariat further wishes to clarify that, contrary to certain speculative media reports, this matter has not been brought before the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group, which deals with serious or persistent violations of Commonwealth values.
