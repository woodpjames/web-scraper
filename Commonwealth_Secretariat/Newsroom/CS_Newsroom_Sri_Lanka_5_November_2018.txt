The Secretary-General referred to the Commonwealth Charter, adopted in 2012 by all the Commonwealth member states which specifically refers to the responsibility of governments, political parties and civil society to uphold and promote democratic culture and practices. The Secretary-General encouraged the political leaders and people of Sri Lanka to engage in constructive dialogue and ensure that the country’s constitution and the rule of law is upheld.
