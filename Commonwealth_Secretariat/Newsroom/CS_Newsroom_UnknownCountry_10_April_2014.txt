Statement by the Commonwealth Secretary-General on the passing of A. N. R. Robinson
10 April 2014
Today, we mourn the passing of Arthur Napoleon Raymond Robinson, an exemplary leader and statesman of Trinidad & Tobago, the Caribbean and the Commonwealth. He served with distinction as both President and Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago. His dedication to advancing Caribbean regionalism, initially through the West Indies Federation, and subsequently his strong support for the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) remain worthy of high recognition. ANR Robinson will also forever be internationally recognised for his proposal that eventually led to the founding of the International Criminal Court. Our thoughts and prayers are with the Robinson family at this sad time. On behalf of the Commonwealth family, I also offer condolences to the people of Trinidad and Tobago, who have lost a truly remarkable and inspirational statesman - one who contributed so much to his country, the Caribbean, the Commonwealth and the world at large.
