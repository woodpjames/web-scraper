While in The Bahamas, the Secretary-General will meet Prime Minister, Perry Christie; Deputy Prime Minister, Philip Davis; and the Attorney General, Allyson Maynard Gibson. Mr Sharma will also call on the Minister of Youth, Sports and Culture, Dr Daniel Johnson and the Minister of Education, Science and Technology, Jerome Fitzgerald. The visit comes ahead of next year’s 19th Conference of Commonwealth Education Ministers, which will be hosted by The Bahamas under the theme ‘Quality education for equitable development: performance, paths and productivity.’ In relation to this, the Secretary-General will tour the Atlantis Hotel, which will be the venue for the education meeting.The conference will take place from 22-26 June in the capital, Nassau. Mr Sharma said: “My visit to The Bahamas comes at a time of heightened focus on the Commonwealth’s small states. This follows the recent Small Island Developing States summit in Samoa where the Commonwealth was able to offer a practical tool to help address the vulnerability and resilience issues shared by the bulk of the our membership. “Additionally, I am looking forward to reviewing preparations for 19th Conference of Commonwealth Education Ministers, which is the largest ministerial meeting convened by the Commonwealth.” On 30 September, Mr Sharma will give a public lecture on Youth in the Commonwealth, which links to the 2015 Commonwealth theme: A Young Commonwealth.
