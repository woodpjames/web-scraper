Get creative for Commonwealth Day
26 February 2014
With Commonwealth Day (10 March 2014) less than a week away, schoolchildren and young people around the globe are being challenged to get creative to mark the annual event. Taking place on the second Monday in March each year, Commonwealth Day is an opportunity to promote understanding on global issues, international co-operation and Commonwealth values. To celebrate this year’s theme – ‘#TeamCommonwealth’ – students are encouraged to create their own poster design using pencils, pens, paint or pixels. Designs will be published on the Commonwealth website. The design should focus on the idea of teamwork or friendship. Share your creation with us via info@commonwealth.int, by post or via Facebook or Twitter. Designs should be received by 1 May.
