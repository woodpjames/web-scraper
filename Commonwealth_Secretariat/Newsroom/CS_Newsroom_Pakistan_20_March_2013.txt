20 March 2013
“I have been deeply impressed with Pakistan’s commitment, in the face of immense challenges, to allow the democratic process to come to fruition over the past five years. For this, Pakistan’s political parties, its institutions and its people are to be commended. "The Commonwealth looks forward to the appointment of a caretaker government that fulfils its constitutional obligation of holding timely, free and fair elections and the peaceful transfer of power to the newly elected representatives of the country. "Pakistan is one of the founding members of the modern Commonwealth, and its membership greatly enriches our association. We stand firmly by Pakistan as it continues on its journey of democratic consolidation."
