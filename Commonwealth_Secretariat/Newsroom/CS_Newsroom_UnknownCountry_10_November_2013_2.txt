Calm must prevail in the interests of all Maldivians - Commonwealth Special Envoy
10 November 2013
Sir Donald said: "Regrettably, this decision is not unexpected, despite best efforts of the Commonwealth and the United Nations to encourage the President to stay within the constitution. "I understand people's anguish, but calm must prevail in the interests of all Maldivians. "I naturally hope that the second round of the election will go ahead on 16th November, as pledged by the President in his address to the nation tonight."
