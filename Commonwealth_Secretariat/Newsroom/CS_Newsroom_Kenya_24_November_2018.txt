Kenya is championing the Blue Economy - an action group focusing on the exploitation and maintenance of a healthy marine environment, and is inviting more than 6,000 participants from around the world to its first global sustainable Blue Economy Conference. "The enthusiasm we are getting from governments and the public has really far exceeded our expectations,” comments Jeff Ardron, who leads the Blue Charter project for the Commonwealth Secretariat. “Clearly, the Ocean’s time has arrived.” At the event, each of the eight action groups will report on their activities and progress and a panel discussion on regional cooperation among member countries will follow.
