Commonwealth Games Opening Statement by Kamalesh Sharma
19 July 2014
Todayâ€™s Opening of the 20th Commonwealth Games in Glasgow brings fresh inspiration to people of all ages, and in every member state and territory throughout our Commonwealth family. The majority of Commonwealth citizens worldwide are young people and children. This grand spectacle of sport enables our youth to gain a vision of the convening power of the Commonwealth, and the outstanding potential of its networks as an influence for good. By advancing democracy, development, and respect for diversity, our Commonwealth kinship and affinity help us shape a future in which there is mutual understanding and respect between people and nations, with freedom, dignity and justice, and opportunity for all to fulfil their potential so that none are left behind. Glasgow 2014 is a showcase for friendship, and all to which our member states have committed themselves in the Commonwealth Charter. At places of work, learning, and recreation; between citizens, communities, and nations; in trade and governance; we work together for equity and inclusiveness. On behalf of all Commonwealth citizens I thank the City of Glasgow, the Scottish Government and people, and the Government and people of the United Kingdom for hosting this magnificent gathering and associated events. We pay tribute to the efforts of each competitor and every team for their enterprise and endeavour, and look forward to inspiring feats of performance and outstanding achievement in the days ahead.
