Serious accident in Cameroon
22 October 2016
On learning of the tragic rail disaster near Eseka in Cameroon the Secretary-General of the Commonwealth, Patricia Scotland, expressed condolences and sympathy. At least 55 people are reported to have been killed, and perhaps as many as six hundred people injured. Speaking from London the Secretary-General said, “ I am shocked to hear about the derailment of the crowded passenger train travelling from Yaounde to Douala. The thoughts and prayers of the people of the Commonwealth will be with all those of our brothers and sisters affected by this dreadful event. The families, friends and colleagues of all those who have lost their lives, or who are wounded in body or mind, and all who are working in the emergency or support services to deal with the impact of this derailment can be assured of our deep concern for their welfare at this time of sadness and great stress.” Expressing the hope that national and regional government would receive swiftly any assistance needed and that could be offered by neighbouring states or the wider Commonwealth, Secretary-General Scotland assured the Government of Cameroon and the people of the country that she stood ready to do all she could to help mobilise emergency and recovery assistance
