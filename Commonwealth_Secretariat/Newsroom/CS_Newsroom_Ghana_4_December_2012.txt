Ghana polls: Commonwealth observers call for peaceful conduct
4 December 2012
Commonwealth observers in Ghana for the 7 December 2012 presidential and parliamentary polls have called on all key actors to conduct themselves in a peaceful manner to ensure that the elections take place in a calm environment. Speaking to journalists in the capital, Accra, on 4 December 2012, the Chair of the Commonwealth Observer Group, former Lesotho Prime Minister, Dr Pakalitha Mosisili, said this year’s elections in Ghana present an opportunity for the country to further enhance the country’s democratic reputation. “It is therefore imperative that the electoral process is transparent, fair, credible and free of violence. It is important voters are able to cast their ballots in a peaceful atmosphere and for their votes to count — for as I often say, the voice of the people is the voice of God,” Dr Mosisili observed. He said the Group is encouraged by the recent peace pact by political leaders and various calls by civil society and community leaders for peaceful elections. “We call on all political parties and other stakeholders to play their roles responsibly, live up to their pronouncements and to adopt a constructive approach to the entire process,” he added. “These elections are an opportunity to make Ghana, Africa and indeed the Commonwealth proud.” Caption: Former Lesotho Prime Minister and Chair of the Commonwealth Observer Group to Ghana, Dr Pakalitha Mosisili, speaks to journalists in Accra, Ghana, on 4 December 2012.
