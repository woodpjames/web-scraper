Quiet Reflection soars to Commonwealth Cup victory at Royal Ascot
16 June 2016
Having sparkled on its debut last year, the Commonwealth Cup was a highlight at this year's Royal Ascot. Twelve horses and their jockeys thundererd down the course at 3.40pm today, each vying to be the first to complete the race and win the prize. But it was Quiet Reflection, a three-year old filly, who soared to victory. It is only the second time the Commonwealth Cup has been run since its inauguration in June 2015. Commonwealth Secretary-General Scotland commented: "In advancing the values of the Commonwealth Charter, our 53 member states achieve practical impact in the lives and livelihoods of all our citizens by working together towards excellence and inclusiveness. Royal Ascot has long been a byword for excellence, and the Commonwealth Cup, open to fillies, colts and geldings, is a pleasing reminder of inclusiveness and gender equality!" This year’s racecard ensured today's race was just as exciting as the first in 2015, which was won by Charles Hills’ Muhaarar. The Commonwealth Cup sparkled on debut in 2015 at #RoyalAscot and is a highlight of the Friday action this year https://t.co/hiuHVTP8Kw — Ascot Racecourse (@Ascot) June 10, 2016 Bringing a special Commonwealth focus to the day, the Commonwealth Cup is a Group 1 sprint race. Run over a distance of six furlongs, it is open to three year old colts, geldings and fillies and is the only Group 1 flat race in the UK exclusively for three-year-olds that allows geldings to compete. Well done Quiet Reflection - winner of #CommonwealthCup 2016 at #RoyalAscot https://t.co/zVJso3zh9k — The Commonwealth (@commonwealthsec) June 17, 2016  Photo caption: The Commonwealth Secretary-General and the Commonwealth Secretariat’s Board of Governors stand proudly with the Commonwealth Cup, which will be presented to the winner of the race at Royal Ascot on Friday 17 June 2016.
