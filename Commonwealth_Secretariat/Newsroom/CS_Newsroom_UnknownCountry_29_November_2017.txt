29 November 2017
Commonwealth Secretary-General Patricia Scotland has said thatÂ climate change requires a complete regenerative revolution in the way we interact with our environment. She was speaking at the High Level Segment of the COP23 conference in Bonn, Germany. The Secretary-General said, "When Commonwealth leaders meet in London next April, we will again be considering practical action to tackle climate change, to protect the environment, and increase the resilience of our members through sustainable development in accordance with the values and principles of our Commonwealth Charter." The Commonwealth would continue to "develop a regenerative approach to implement the Paris Agreement and achieve NDCs (nationally determined contributions) as we build towards a Common Earth", she said.
