Jubilee Time Capsule to celebrate Queen’s 60 years as Head of Commonwealth
22 August 2011
To mark the 2012 Diamond Jubilee of HM Queen Elizabeth II as Head of the Commonwealth, the Royal Commonwealth Society is compiling a time capsule of memorable events during those 22,000 days. The charity is calling for people to send in stories about their experiences in Commonwealth countries during the past 60 years. The best contributions will go into the capsule and will be part of a permanent archive for people to learn about life in the Commonwealth. The entries can be text, photographs, audio recordings or videos, which can be uploaded on the Jubilee Time Capsule website http://jubileetimecapsule.org The time capsule was launched at the Commonwealth Day Observance, attended by the Queen, at Westminster Abbey in March 2011. It will be buried in the grounds of Buckingham Palace and some of the content will be used as part of the Diamond Jubilee celebrations around the Commonwealth in 2012. By submitting an entry, you could also be eligible to win prizes including: a trip to London to officially launch the time capsule in the presence of the Queen; tickets; camera equipment; software; internships locally to where you live; cash; and books. Some of the high-profile entries include: - The Very Reverend Dr John Hall, Dean of Westminster Abbey, about officiating at the Royal Wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton; - Ruth Rouse, High Commissioner for Grenada, talking about her speech at former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan's farewell ceremony; - Jean Kekedo, High Commissioner for Papua New Guinea, recalling the Queen’s 80th birthday Service of Thanksgiving; - Chipo Chung, who recently appeared in the BBC television adaptation of Camelot, about her initiation into Zimbabwe politics and spending a night in a Harare prison; - and Debbie Ransome, former Head of the BBC Caribbean Service, about the world’s amazing response to the devastating Haiti earthquake on 12 January 2010. The time capsule will be closed in June 2012. To submit an entry or for details go to http://www.jubileetimecapsule.org/
