Children’s voices sing out in Commonwealth Day premiere
13 March 2018
Among the youngest artists taking part in yesterday’s Commonwealth Day celebrations in London were 400 members of the Commonwealth Children’s Choir, accompanied by the Band of the Coldstream Guards. They were performing a brand new song which will welcome the Commonwealth heads of government when they attend next month’s key meeting in London. The youngsters did not let the rain dampen their enthusiasm as they performed the world-premiere of “To be a Friend”, which is dedicated to the Her Majesty The Queen. It was commissioned by the Commonwealth Youth Orchestra and Choir (CYO) especially for next month’s event.  Also at yesterday’s performance the CYO announced the winners of the Commonwealth Music Competitions for 2017. The top slot for Commonwealth Community Choir 2017 went to the National Youth Choir of Antigua and Barbuda. As part of their prize, 20 members of the choir will enjoy an all-expense paid trip to the United Kingdom to perform with the CYO. The choir will also be made Commonwealth Music Ambassadors for 2018. The award for Commonwealth Children’s Choir 2017 was given to the choir of St Michael’s School in the London Borough of Newham. They too will have an all-expenses paid trip to perform with the CYO, will be made Commonwealth Music Ambassadors 2018 and the school will receive a donation of £1000 from the CYO.
