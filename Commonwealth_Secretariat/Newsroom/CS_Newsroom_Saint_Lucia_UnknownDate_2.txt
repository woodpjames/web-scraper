Supporting national strategic development planning in Saint Lucia
UnknownDate
Saint Lucia faces a number of challenges to its economic development including dependence on a narrow range of exports, resource limitations, and access to major markets, and vulnerability to natural disasters. Exposure to these factors has affected the ability of St Lucia to progress towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). This project reflected the United Nation’s Mauritius Strategy for the implementation of the 'Barbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States' which calls for an integrated approach to sustainable development in small states. This project assisted DEPND to develop a National Sustainable Development Strategy (NSDS) that integrates social, economic, environmental and political aspects to ensure the sustainable use of resources and development. The project aimed to ensure the NSDS encompasses a poverty reduction strategy as one of the main development priorities. The immediate beneficiaries of this project were the DEPND, which has received both the foundationary frameworks and documents as well as strengthened capacity to develop integrated and sustainable development plans. The NSDS itself will support the economic resilience of Saint Lucia across the key resilience components of macroeconomic stability, microeconomic efficiency, good governance and social cohesion. In the longer term the wider public and private sectors will consequently benefit through enhanced coherence and collaboration across the development agenda, and more strategic implementation of national development priorities, responding to the sustainable development challenges across Saint Lucia.
