Thabo Mbeki heads Commonwealth electoral mission in Ghana
21 November 2016
The former president of South Africa, Thabo Mbeki, will lead the Commonwealth Observer Group in next month's general elections in Ghana. This follows an invitation to the Commonwealth Secretariat from the country's independent electoral commission. The polls on 7 December will elect Ghana's president and its parliamentarians. The Commonwealth Secretary-General Patricia Scotland said, "Earlier this week our high commissioners made it clear that one of our core functions is observing elections. So I am delighted that someone as eminent as former President Mbeki has agreed to head this important mission to Ghana. "As a campaigner for human rights and an advocate of the rule of law, I believe these missions are at the heart of seeing democracy in action.Â  To the people of Ghana fewer things can be more important than knowing they are choosing their leaders and their future in a fair and democratic process." After the elections, the Commonwealth Observer Group will transmit its report to Secretary-General Scotland so that she may convey observations and any recommendations to the government of Ghana, all the political parties, and the wider Commonwealth family.
