SDG14 and trade in fish: UNCTAD event at The Ocean Conference
UnknownDate
The call for action of the UN Ocean Conference will set a new direction in the implementation and advancement of Sustainable Development Goal 14, incorporate new voluntary commitments and allow for the development of new multi-stakeholder partnerships. At this event, entitled ‘Trade in fish-related aspects of SDG 14: What next?’ Commonwealth Secretary-General Patricia Scotland will speak alongside the Honorary President of the IOI, the Secretary-General of UNCTAD and the Directors-General of the FAO and WTO. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) will briefly present the findings of their flagship reports, The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture 2016 (SOFIA), and The Trade and Environment Review 2016: Trade in Fish (TER). In addition, the World Trade Organization (WTO) will provide an update on the fisheries subsidies negotiations in Geneva. This high level dialogue will seek to gather the advice of heads of delegation and permanent representatives at the UN in New York on how to transfer this guidance into fresh action and support to member states in the trade in fish and the development of oceans-based economic sectors.
