Democracy not a destination but a journey – Don McKinnon
12 September 2012
He was pleased that all stakeholders have accepted the report despite any reservations they might individually hold.  Sir Donald, who was in Maldives from 8-12 September 2012, met with key stakeholders to discuss how the Commonwealth can best assist Maldives in taking forward the recommendations made by the Commission of National Enquiry. “The Commission’s report provides key recommendations on issues that need to be addressed to strengthen democratic practice in Maldives. I am heartened to hear the commitment of the government to take forward key reforms to strengthen democratic institutions,” said Sir Donald. “Democracy is not just the responsibility of the government, but also of every institution and all citizens. The Commonwealth stands ready to work with the Government of Maldives and its people to enhance democracy, the rule of law and human rights. I am also pleased to hear that the Parliamentary Committees are expected to resume work soon and that the People’s Majlis is scheduled to reconvene on 1 October 2012.” He encouraged the people of Maldives to work together to heal the political divide in the country. “Democracy is not a destination, but a journey. I hope that every institution, political party and individual citizen will make it their business to be part of that journey,” said Sir Donald. Note to Editors Commonwealth Secretary-General Kamalesh Sharma appointed the Rt Hon Sir Donald McKinnon as his Special Envoy to Maldives on 1 March 2012.
