Commonwealth election observers are now in Zambia meeting with key stakeholders as the country prepares to go to the polls on 20 September 2011. The observers are considering all factors that influence the fairness and credibility of the elections. The group has already met with representatives of the Electoral Commission of Zambia. The team will be deployed around the country to observe the voting, counting and poll. At a press conference in Lusaka on 15 September, Chair of the Commonwealth Observer Group General Yakubu Gowon introduced the group to the media. The team comprises 12 members drawn from across the Commonwealth and includes politicians, members of election commissions and representatives of the media, youth and civil society, and is supported by a Commonwealth Secretariat staff team.
