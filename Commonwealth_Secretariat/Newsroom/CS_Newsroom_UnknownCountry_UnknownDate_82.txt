Fostering Green Economies through Trade, Investment and Innovation - UNCTAD 14 Round Table
UnknownDate
The greening of economies will require a transformation of consumption and production patterns. There is an urgent need to find new ways to produce and consume in a manner that respect planetary boundaries, combat climate change, reduce waste, and preserve biodiversity. Trade, investment, and innovation both have to adapt to these changes and can - with the right policies - be important drivers for transformation. Investment can scale up green production, trade can enhance the accessibility and affordability of green goods and services, and innovation can boost green technologies. This round table will discuss what is needed in the areas of trade, investment, and innovation to spur green economies and the development potential of this transformation.
