Statement by Commonwealth Secretary-General on London tube ‘terror incident’
15 September 2017
Commonwealth Secretary-General Patricia Scotland has expressed her sympathy and solidarity with the government and the people of the United Kingdom after the latest terror attack in London. Secretary-General Scotland said, “As we hear the sad news of more innocent people being targeted and injured in a terror attack, my thoughts and prayers are with all those affected by the outrage this morning. “Terrorism respects no religion or boundaries and this incident happened at a time when children would have been travelling to school, or commuters were simply trying to get to work. We in the Commonwealth family stand united against all who would seek to divide us and we condemn all such attacks.” This is the fifth terror attack in the UK this year.
