19 September 2013
The people of Maldives must be the winners of this election said the Commonwealth Secretary-General’s Special Envoy Sir Donald McKinnon. “I was very pleased by the positive findings of the national and international observers, including those of the Commonwealth Observer Group. “This election marks a renewal of the country’s democratic credentials, with an 88% voter turnout. “This displays a determination to get the country back on to a sound democratic foundation. “There are always losers in every election everywhere, but the winners here must be the people of Maldives.  The results of their votes must be paramount to the process and the result,” said Sir Donald. “International opinion is firmly behind the need for the second round of the elections to proceed as planned on 28 September. “I sincerely call on all political leaders to respect the intentions and expectations laid out in the constitution. "I look forward to remaining closely engaged with Maldives as the country affirms its commitment to Commonwealth democratic values in the coming days and weeks, in the lead up to the inauguration of a newly elected President on 11 November 2013,” concluded the Special Envoy.
