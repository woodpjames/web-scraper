The Queen's Commonwealth Canopy
17 November 2016
Her Majesty The Queen hosted a reception at Buckingham Palace on Tuesday to recognise the 20 countries which have already committed to The Queen's Commonwealth Canopy (QCC), a unique network of conservation initiatives that will preserve indigenous forests for future generations and create a lasting legacy of The Queen’s leadership of the Commonwealth. Guests included Sir David Attenborough, Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Boris Johnson, and High Commissioners in London. The QCC was launched at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Malta, in 2015. The QCC is a project designed to create a network of forest conservation initiatives throughout the 52 nations of the Commonwealth to mark Her Majesty The Queen’s service and dedication as Head of the Commonwealth. The initiative is being led by the Royal Commonwealth Society, in partnership with the NGO Cool Earth and the Commonwealth Forestry Association.
