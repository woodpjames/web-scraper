Commonwealth Youth Awards Ceremony
UnknownDate
The Commonwealth Youth Awards for Excellence in Development work project is one attempt to raise the profile and highlight the contribution young people make to achieving development goals. These awards recognise young people whose commitment to development work within a Commonwealth country has made a difference to the lives of others. Designed to help celebrate the role of young people as nation builders and partners in development, the Awards offer young people under 30 an opportunity to share their contribution and inspire others to get involved and international recognition and support for their development project. Young people throughout the Commonwealth undertake projects and initiatives ranging from poverty alleviation to conflict prevention and resolution, in their diligent efforts at promoting and enhancing their democracy and development. This work should never go un-noticed, and therefore the Commonwealth Youth Awards will give international, regional and national recognition and support to those young men and women who have demonstrated that youth have the capacity and potential to make positive contributions to their communities, nations and the world at large. During the ceremony, the awardees will share their experiences in youth development and empowerment work.
