Deputy Secretary-General Masire-Mwamba to visit Cameroon
5 July 2013
Mrs Masire-Mwamba will deliver a speech at the International Colloquium on Civic Education and National Integration, whose theme is ‘Civic Education and National Integration: Stake, Challenges and Perspectives for an Emerging Cameroon.’ The forum is organised by Cameroon Ministry of Civic Education and Youth Affairs with the objective of ‘developing, in a participatory manner, strategies and mechanisms that will cultivate in all Cameroonians, the civic and patriotic spirit and promote harmonious living’. It will take place at the Yaounde Conference Centre. Speaking ahead of her visit, Mrs Masire-Mwamba said Cameroon is a valued member of the Commonwealth, and congratulated the country for organising the forum. “The Commonwealth places strong emphasis on civil efforts and civic education as a means to foster national cohesion, which is a key ingredient for promoting peace, democracy, development and respect for diversity,” the Deputy Secretary-General said. She added: “Through the seminal work of the Commonwealth Commission on Respect and Understanding, practical toolkits for promoting harmonious living in diverse societies were identified. We believe that the findings of the Commission, particularly the focus on the role of young people and civic education can complement the excellent efforts that Cameroon has set in motion through this national integration process.” While in Cameroon, Mrs Masire-Mwamba hopes to make courtesy calls on senior government officials and other stakeholders.
