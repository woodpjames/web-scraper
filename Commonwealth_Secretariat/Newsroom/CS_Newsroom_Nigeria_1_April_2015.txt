Statement by Secretary-General on elections in Nigeria
1 April 2015
Commonwealth Secretary-General Kamalesh Sharma has congratulated Nigeria’s President-elect Muhammadu Buhari on his victory in last weekend’s election. He noted that history had been made with Mr Buhari becoming the first Nigerian opposition leader to be elected through the ballot box. Mr Sharma expressed admiration for the statesmanship and democratic spirit with which President Goodluck Jonathan congratulated President-elect Muhammadu Buhari on his victory, even before this morning's official announcement of the result. “The people of Nigeria have demonstrated their deep commitment to democracy by exercising their right, recognised in the Commonwealth Charter, to participate in democratic processes, in particular through free and fair elections, in shaping the society in which they live. It was particularly heartening to see the active participation of young people in this election process,” Mr Sharma said. He also acknowledged the pivotal role played by the Independent National Electoral Commission, under the leadership of Professor Attahiru Jega, in delivering a credible election. The Secretary-General thanked Dr Bakili Muluzi, Chair of the Commonwealth Observer Group to Nigeria’s elections. In a letter to the former President of Malawi, he said: “My appreciation also extends to the entire Group that you have led so ably. Through your exemplary leadership you have shown a deep commitment to promoting the Commonwealth’s fundamental political values.” Mr Sharma added that the Commonwealth remains ready to support Nigeria in the post-election phase.
