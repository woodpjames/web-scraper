New policy series to help governments and financial institutions
10 July 2018
Commonwealth countries will benefit from a new series of technical papers providing guidance in areas such as remittances, aid, tourism and the impact of Brexit. Titled, the ‘Economics Technical Working Paper Series’, the initiative will use the latest empirical techniques in the areas of econometrics and statistics to contribute evidenced-based policy advice to countries and international financial institutions (IFIs). Specifically, papers will provide a Commonwealth lens through which development organisations can better understand current policy, practice and thinking on the economic development of countries.  Ultimately, the aim of the series is to positively influence IFIs and member governments macroeconomic policies and to help find solutions to current policy challenges. In the first two editions, researchers in the Commonwealth Secretariat’s Small States and Finance Policy team explore the impact of Brexit on Commonwealth tourism, remittances and aid; and present an analysis on debt and natural disasters in small island developing countries. The series is published on a quarterly basis and is available Open Access on the Commonwealth iLibrary.  Researchers in Commonwealth countries and member governments are invited to contribute to the series.
