Leonard Cohen
11 November 2016
Tributes have been paid to one of music’s greats, the Canadian poet and songwriter, Leonard Cohen, who has died aged 82. He was born in Westmount in Montreal on 21 September 1934. Cohen’s father died when the singer was nine but he was left a trust fund so he could follow his literary career. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, led the tributes. “It is with deep sorrow that I learned today of the death of the legendary Leonard Cohen,” he said. “A most remarkable Montrealer, Leonard Cohen managed to reach the highest of artistic achievement, both as an acclaimed poet and a world-renowned singer-songwriter. He will be fondly remembered for his gruff vocals, his self-deprecating humor and the haunting lyrics that made his songs the perennial favorite of so many generations. “Leonard Cohen is as relevant today as he was in the 1960s. His ability to conjure the vast array of human emotion made him one of the most influential and enduring musicians ever. His style transcended the vagaries of fashion.” Cohen's manager, Robert Kory, told Rolling Stone: “Unmatched in his creativity, insight and crippling candour, Leonard Cohen was a true visionary whose voice will be sorely missed. He leaves behind a legacy of work that will bring insight, inspiration and healing for generations to come.” The musician was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2008. His hits included the timeless, haunting and oft recorded Hallelujah, Suzanne, Bird on the Wire and I'm Your Man. Last month, Cohen released ‘You Want It Darker’ his 14th album. Among the songs ‘On Traveling Light’ which has the prescient lyrics: “It’s au revoir. I’m running late. They’ll close the bar. I used to play one mean guitar.”
