Commonwealth Secretary-General expresses concern for Tanzania quake victims
13 September 2016
Commonwealth Secretary-General Patricia Scotland today offered her condolences to the people and government of Tanzania following the earthquake which struck the northwest of the country. The death toll has reportedly climbed to 17 following Saturday’s quake, which measured 5.7 on the Richter Scale. More than 250 people have been injured and 800 families made homeless, as tremors were felt in Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda. A smaller aftershock hit Tanzania again on Monday. The Secretary-General said: “On behalf of the Commonwealth, I offer our deepest condolences to the families of those killed in this earthquake. Our thoughts are with those who have suffered trauma and injury and whose homes have been damaged and destroyed. “The Commonwealth stands in solidarity with the Government of Tanzania as it co-ordinates the relief effort. I am heartened to see material assistance being provided from Commonwealth neighbours and I feel sure other member states will want to join in offering support at this time of great need.”
