CommonTies Autumn Event 2016
UnknownDate
CommonTies was launched by the Commonwealth Secretariat in 2016, as an opportunity for young Commonwealth citizens to engage with the Commonwealth and connect with other young people with similar interests and professional aspirations. The initiative aims to assist young future leaders to develop peer connections, build an understanding of the Commonwealthâ€™s contributions to development and democracy, and interact with prominent leaders or role models relevant to their professional aspirations. The autumnal event will feature a high-level panel of officials from the national and international public service, who will speak about using their skills and expertise to create change in their countries and across the globe.
