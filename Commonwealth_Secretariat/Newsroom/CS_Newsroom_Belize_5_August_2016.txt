Assuring the Government and people of Belize of Commonwealth solidarity at this testing time, the Secretary-General said: "Extreme weather, such as has wrought such havoc and brought such distress to our Commonwealth sisters and brothers in Belize, is an increasing threat as we strive to build resilience and overcome vulnerability in our member states. "In conveying sympathy to the many thousands who have lost their homes, especially the very young and the very old, I know citizens in all our member states would wish me to pledge afresh our Commonwealth support for the people and emergency services in Belize, and our commitment to helping them to rebuild their lives and livelihoods and the vital infrastructure on which they depend."
