Commonwealth Students Congress
UnknownDate
The triennial Conference of Commonwealth Education Ministers (CCEM) enables Commonwealth education ministers, teachers, stakeholders, and students to discuss key education issues in the Commonwealth in relation to a specified theme, and to identify areas for action for the next three years. In addition to the main Education ministers meeting there will be a Youth Forum. The Forum is a major event in its own right, bringing students (18-29 years) from across the Commonwealth to discuss issues of critical importance to achieving progress in education. Student leaders will have the opportunity to interact with Ministers and senior government officials and to present to them statements based on their deliberations. At the Youth Forum the role and contribution of students in education will be explored through an interactive programme designed to inspire and motivate participants. Student leaders will express their opinions, explore and exchange ideas on how to improve student contributions to education systems across the Commonwealth, and take steps to organise the CSA through it the ratification of the CSA constitution and the election of the first CSA Executives.
