Cyclone Pam: Secretary-General calls for Commonwealth-wide support
16 March 2015
Secretary-General Kamalesh Sharma has called on the wider Commonwealth family to provide support to Vanuatu and Tuvalu, following the devastation wrought by Cyclone Pam in the south Pacific last week. “I call on the Commonwealth family at large to see how it can help direct support through coordinated disaster relief efforts,” he said on Monday. This follows his communication over the weekend to the Prime Ministers of Vanuatu and Tuvalu, conveying Commonwealth solidarity with the two Pacific islands struck by the category five tropical storm. The Commonwealth is at the forefront of addressing the vulnerabilities of its 26 small island states, including through its work on climate change and resilience.
