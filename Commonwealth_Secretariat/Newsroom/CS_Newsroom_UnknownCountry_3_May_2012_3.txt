Message from the Commonwealth Secretariat on World Press Freedom Day - 3 May 2012
3 May 2012
On World Press Freedom Day, the Commonwealth Secretariat reaffirms the strong attachment the association places on a free and responsible press in promoting democracy, development and diversity. Commonwealth leaders have consistently re-affirmed their commitment to promoting the fundamental values and principles of the association, which include freedom of expression and freedom of the press. The challenge is to translate these commitments into action â€’ moving beyond declarations to walking the talk. Our priority at the Commonwealth Secretariat is to continue working with member states to assist them to observe what they have agreed to do. There cannot be a properly functioning democracy without a free and responsible press. We shall continue to support the development of responsible and professional journalism, while at the same time working to ensure that there is a conducive political, legal and economic environment for journalists to operate from.  Richard Uku Spokesperson and Director of Communications and Public Affairs Commonwealth Secretariat
