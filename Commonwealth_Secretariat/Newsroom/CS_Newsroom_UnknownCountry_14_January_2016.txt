Commonwealth report brings fresh perspective to global trade issues
14 January 2016
This morning the Commonwealth Secretariat and Trade out of Poverty All-Party Parliamentary Group held a seminar on the subject of the Commonwealth in the unfolding global trade landscape. Speaking at the event, Deputy Secretary-General Deodat Maharaj said the Commonwealth was: "fully committed to supporting its member states in their trade agendas, to deepen the analytical work and continue supporting its member states reaping the benefits on international trade and their integration into the global economy." He stated that "The Commonwealth has been a strong supporter of promoting a fair and equitable global trading system", adding that the "recent release of the inaugural Commonwealth Trade Review brings a fresh perspective to the global trade issues facing our members." The Commonwealth trade flagship report, 'The Commonwealth in the Unfolding Global Trade Landscape - Commonwealth Trade Review 2015' was officially launched at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting held in Malta in November 2015. Since its launch the Review has been well-received with its interesting findings reported in numerous online and print media.
