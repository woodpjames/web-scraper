Ricken Patel, Executive Director of Avaaz, to deliver Commonwealth Lecture
5 February 2013
Founding President and Executive Director of Avaaz, Ricken Patel, will speak on this year’s Commonwealth Theme ‘Opportunity through Enterprise’ at the Commonwealth Lecture on 12 March. Avaaz is a global campaigning movement which has rapidly grown since 2007 into the largest online activist community in the world at 18 million members in 194 countries. 'Avaaz' means 'voice' in many languages, and has a simple democratic mission: to close the gap between the world we have and the world most people everywhere want. Mr Patel was in Foreign Policy magazine's 100 Top Global Thinkers in 2012. He was named a 'Young Global Leader' by the Davos World Economic Forum and was listed 'Ultimate Gamechanger in Politics' by Huffington Post. The 16th Commonwealth Lecture will be held at the Guildhall in London, UK. Tickets are limited and attendance is strictly by prior registration only. The Commonwealth Lecture is organised by the Commonwealth Foundation - a development organisation uniquely situated at the interface between government and civil society. It develops the capacity of civil society to act together and learn from each other to engage with the institutions that shape people’s lives. The Lecture follows Commonwealth Day on 11 March.
