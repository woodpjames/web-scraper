Warmest wishes to the bride and groom
18 May 2018
Young people from the 53 member countries of the Commonwealth wish Prince Harry and Meghan Markle a long and happy marriage, lighting the way to a bright and exciting future for the Commonwealth. During the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in April, the Queen appointed Prince Harry as the Commonwealth’s Youth Ambassador. Speaking at the Youth Forum as he took up his duties, Prince Harry spoke from the heart when he said "I am here to support you, and I cannot wait to see what we're going to achieve together." The Commonwealth’s young people are also here to support their Prince and his bride.  They cannot wait to see what they will achieve together! Prince Harry told young people from all over the world: “I am also incredibly grateful that the woman that I am about to marry, Meghan, will be joining me in this work, which she too is hugely excited to take part in." Young people from across the Commonwealth are rejoicing as the bride and groom begin their journey and forge a new relationship both for themselves and the young people of the Commonwealth.
