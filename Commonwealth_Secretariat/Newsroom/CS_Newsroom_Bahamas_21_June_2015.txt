Bahamas all set for education meeting
21 June 2015
The Bahamas is set to welcome delegates to the Commonwealth’s largest ministerial meeting, which begins in Nassau on Tuesday. Deputy Chair of the organising taskforce, Marcellus Taylor said at the weekend: “Preparations are complete and the pre-conference meetings have begun. The Bahamas is looking forward to fruitful discussions and the opportunity for Commonwealth countries to share ideas and shape policy.  The Bahamas is proud to be hosting this significantly-timed meeting.” The 19th meeting of Commonwealth Education Ministers – or 19CCEM – is held every three years and brings together government ministers, policymakers, teachers, civil society, academics and students. This year’s theme will focus on quality and skills, within the context of new development goals in education. In September, world leaders will meet at the UN to agree on a set of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to replace the Millennium Development Goals, which end this year.  Goal 4, on Education concerns inclusive and equitable quality education and the promotion of lifelong learning opportunities. Dr Joanna Nurse, Head of Education and Health at the Commonwealth Secretariat said the 19CCEM is unique because it provides for a cross-section of ideas from practitioners to policymakers and students. “This overarching approach encourages meaningful debate with input from a broad range of education planners. We are very much looking forward to outcomes that can prepare Commonwealth countries to manage the challenges and harness the opportunities ahead.”
