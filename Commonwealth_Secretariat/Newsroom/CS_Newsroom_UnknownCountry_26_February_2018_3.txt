Historic signing to enhance Commonwealth sustainable education
26 February 2018
The Commonwealth Secretariat, the Association of Commonwealth Universities (ACU) and Commonwealth of Learning (COL) have signed a historic partnership agreement to work even closer together to ensure better education for member states. The signing of the Commonwealth Education Partnership (CEP) for Sustainable Development was witnessed by ministers and delegates to the 20th Conference of Commonwealth Education Ministers (CCEM) in Nadi, Fiji.  Overseeing the concordat’s adoption, Commonwealth Secretary-General Patricia Scotland said, “We sign this under the mandates given to us by the Commonwealth heads of government. I am the Secretary-General, not only for the Secretariat but for the all the accredited organisations, including ACU, and COL, an intergovernmental organisation. “This meeting has been quite clear in asking for an even closer partnership so that we can deliver the Sustainable Development Goals, as well as giving targeted and conjoined support to all our member states. We thought this would be an ideal opportunity to consolidate the commitment to work in partnership and express our determination not to leave anyone behind when it comes to giving them a first-class education.”Read the concordat
