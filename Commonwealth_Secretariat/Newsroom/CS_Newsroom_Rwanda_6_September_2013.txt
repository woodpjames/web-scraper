Commonwealth to observe Rwanda Legislative Elections
6 September 2013
Mr Sharma said the Team will be led by Mr Tiro Seeletso, Secretary to the Independent Electoral Commission of Botswana. He will be joined by Mr Russ Hiebert, a Member of Parliament from Canada. The two will be supported by staff from the Commonwealth Secretariat. The CET was constituted by the Secretary-General at the invitation of the National Electoral Commission of Rwanda. Speaking from London, Secretary-General Kamalesh Sharma said the Commonwealth is pleased to observe elections in its newest member. “Democracy and development are the twin pillars of the Commonwealth, and fair and credible elections are the foundation on which responsive government, inclusive development, and respect for diversity are built in our member states,” Mr Sharma said. The mandate of the Team is to observe the preparations for the election; the polling, counting and results process as a whole and, where appropriate, make recommendations for the future strengthening of the electoral framework in Rwanda. It is tasked to act impartially and independently, and to conduct itself according to the standards expressed in the International Declaration of Principles for Elections Observation, to which the Commonwealth is a signatory. The Team’s report will be submitted to the Commonwealth Secretary-General, who will in turn send it to the Government of Rwanda, the National Election Commission of Rwanda and political parties, and thereafter made public. The Team will arrive in Rwanda on 10 September and stay until 23 September 2013.
