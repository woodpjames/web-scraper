5 December 2014
Deputy Secretary-General, Gary Dunn met with four members of the Parliament of Rwanda on 4 December to explore ways of deepening partnership to advance Commonwealth values and cooperation. Mr Dunn discussed with the parliamentarians the many ways in which the Commonwealth works with governments and elected representatives in member states to address emerging global issues, providing practical assistance to help strengthen democratic processes and to advance development. The delegation was led by Senator Tito Rutaremara and included Senator Jacqueline Muhongayire, Hon. Zeno Mutimura MP, Hon. Clotilde Mukakarangwa MP and Mr. Anaclet Muhire Habarurema. The parliamentarians are in London from 2-5 December, and are being hosted by the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association UK Branch (CPA UK). The Rwandan parliamentary visit is part of a reciprocal programme, following a visit to Rwanda by four UK parliamentarians in April.Â  Their four-day programme in Westminster aimed to strengthen relations between the UK and Rwandan Parliaments, sharing experiences and parliamentary best practice.
