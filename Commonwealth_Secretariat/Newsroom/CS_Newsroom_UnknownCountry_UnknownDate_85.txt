Senior officials plan agenda for 2017 Law Ministers Meeting
UnknownDate
Senior officials of law ministries from across the Commonwealth meet in London from 3 to 5 October to set priorities for next year’s Commonwealth Law Ministers Meeting. The triennial Commonwealth Law Ministers Meeting brings together law ministers and attorneys-general from both developing and developed countries from the 53 member states of the Commonwealth. At their London planning meeting, the officials will look at ways to advance the global goals on sustainable development through policy and legislative responses, as well as issues of crime and criminality where governments can share best practices. To be discussed are issues such as peace and security and countering terrorism and preventing violent extremism, the risks of virtual currencies and money laundering, and climate change and disaster response laws. Taxation, ratification and implementation of the Arms Trade Treaty and legal responses and strategies to address child, early and forced marriage are also to be debated. At their last meeting in May 2014 in Botswana, law ministers supported efforts to strengthen the independence, competence and integrity of the judiciary. Ministers also shared information on progress made in developing legislation and establishing institutions to address violence against women. The theme for the 2014 meeting was: 'Consolidating the rule of law and human rights in the Commonwealth'.
