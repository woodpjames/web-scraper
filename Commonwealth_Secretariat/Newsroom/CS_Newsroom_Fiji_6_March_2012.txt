Commonwealth Deputy Secretary-General Mrs Mmasekgoa Masire-Mwamba has commenced a three-day visit to Fiji, leading a four-member team from the Commonwealth Secretariat. “I am very pleased to be visiting Fiji. I look forward to discussing with the government and others how the Commonwealth can best continue to encourage and support the restoration of democracy here, so that Fiji can return to full membership in the Commonwealth family”, said Deputy Secretary-General Masire-Mwamba. The visit, from 7-9 March 2012, forms part of the Commonwealth’s ongoing engagement with Fiji. The delegation will meet with senior members of the government, non-government interlocutors, and representatives of the international community. Note to Editors: Fiji was fully suspended from the Commonwealth in September 2009 by the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG) At the same time, CMAG has consistently encouraged the Secretary-General to remain engaged with Fiji with a view to assisting in the restoration of full respect for democracy, human rights, the rule of law, and other core Commonwealth values as set out in the 2009 Affirmation of Commonwealth Values and Principles.
