Commonwealth and partners issue joint call for ‘non-violent’ Ghana elections
26 November 2016
International organisations have welcomed efforts to agree a peace accord in Ghana ahead of the 7 December general elections. Representatives of the Commonwealth, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the United Nations today issued a statement calling for “non-violent, transparent and credible elections”. The three organisations are encouraging the presidential candidates to participate in a meeting scheduled by the country’s Electoral Commission on 1 December, at which the peace accord may be signed. “The signing of the peace accord on that occasion will be an important public reaffirmation of the candidates’ commitment to peaceful elections,” the representatives say. “The ECOWAS, the Commonwealth and the United Nations call on all the presidential candidates to commit to participate in the December 1, 2016 event, and to take the responsibility to contribute towards non-violent, transparent and credible elections.” The statement was made by Commonwealth Deputy Secretary-General Josephine Ojiambo, ECOWAS Commission President Marcel Alain de Souza, and Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General for West Africa and the Sahel Dr Mohamed Ibn Chambas. Read the statement in full. The 7 December elections will be observed by a team of Commonwealth observers led by the former President of South Africa, Thabo Mbeki.
