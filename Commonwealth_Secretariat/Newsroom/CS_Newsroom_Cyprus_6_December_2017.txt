They discussed how the Commonwealth was a powerful force for good which focuses on tackling challenges faced by the 52-members states; the usefulness of developing toolkits and frameworks especially through the newly established Office of Civil and Criminal Justice Reform (OCCJR); and preparations for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in London next April. The Cypriot delegation also included its high commissioner in London, Euripides Evriviades, and director-general of the House of Representatives, Vassiliki Anastasiadou.
