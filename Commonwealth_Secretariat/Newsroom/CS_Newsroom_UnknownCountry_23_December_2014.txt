Commonwealth Secretary-General’s New Year Greeting 2015
23 December 2014
With a New Year ahead of us, full of promise and the inevitable potential for the unexpected, the Commonwealth family of nations looks to the future with a renewed sense of purpose to work for the common good of its citizens in a rapidly transforming world. Building resilience is a Commonwealth priority. Together we seek to create societies that are more inclusive, free from prejudice and discrimination. We work towards a world in which all in our societies and among the nations of the world are able to share the fruits of progress and prosperity, with none left behind. The solidarity and team spirit of the Commonwealth give us confidence and respect for diversity as we move forward and support one another. Our shared vision is for a safer and more equitable future with the advance of development and democracy bringing enrichment to the lives of citizens in all our member states. Our aspirations are set out in the Commonwealth Charter which opens with the words ‘We the people of the Commonwealth’. The Charter sets out the values and principles which unite the Commonwealth - democracy, development, human rights and the rule of law, and respect for diversity - and it expresses the collective commitment of our member states to advancing free, fair and prosperous societies. Taking satisfaction and encouragement from progress achieved as members of ‘Team Commonwealth’, we commit to attaining fresh goals in 2015 and to continually raising the standards we set for ourselves.
