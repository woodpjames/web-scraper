Lesotho Parliamentary Elections 2012: Interim Statement
29 May 2012
Following an invitation from the Government of the Kingdom of Lesotho, the Commonwealth Secretary-General, Mr Kamalesh Sharma, constituted an Observer Group, which has been present in the Kingdom since 19 May 2012.   I have been honoured to have been asked to Chair the Group.  During our time here, we have met the Independent Electoral Commission, representatives of political parties, civil society, media, the police, the defence force, the diplomatic community as well as other international and national observers. Over the election period, Commonwealth teams were based in Maseru, Leribe, Mohale’s Hoek, Qacha’s Nek and Thaba-Tseka.  Our teams observed the voting, counting and results aggregation and also met with electoral officials, national and international observers and other stakeholders at the District level in order to build a fuller picture regarding the conduct of the process.  This is an interim statement and it is issued prior to the formal declaration of election results.  We will issue a Final Report containing our conclusions on the entire process at a later stage.
