Ghana to host landmark meeting of Commonwealth Africa anti-corruption agencies
23 May 2014
The conference is being organised by the Commonwealth Secretariat in collaboration with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crimes (UNODC), Ghana’s Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice and the Economic and Organised Crime Office. Ghana’s President John Dramani Mahama will open the conference under the theme: ‘Coordinating the National Anti-Corruption Agenda within the Commonwealth’. The annual meeting is a focal point for the Association of Anti-Corruption Agencies in Commonwealth Africa, a network of national agencies established in 2011 to promote collaboration and peer learning. Commonwealth Deputy Secretary-General Deodat Maharaj said: “Corruption is an obstacle to sustained national development: It adversely affects business expansion and job creation thereby constraining growth.  It undermines public confidence and threatens the rule of law. Addressing corruption will also result in more resources being available to invest in the people of Commonwealth Africa in areas such as health and education.” This fourth meeting further cements the Commonwealth’s commitment to supporting African member countries in their fight against corruption. It will provide a platform for discussion and sharing of national experiences and is an opportunity for agencies to strengthen ties, forge partnerships and cooperate beyond the week-long meeting. Participants will also hear from speakers including Frank Vogl, co-founder of Transparency International and Professor Kwame Frimpong, Founding Dean of GIMPA Law School.
