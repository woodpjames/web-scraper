Visit of the Secretary-General to UNESCO
16 March 2015
"Chair of the Executive Board, Ambassador Mohamed Sameh Amr; Director-General, Madam Irina Bokova; Chair of the Commonwealth Group, Ambassador Ruchira Kamboj; Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen: I am honoured to be given this opportunity by the Executive Board to speak today, representing the Commonwealth, a diverse family of 53 member states which cherish the same values and are committed to many of the same goals as UNESCO. We are two organisations founded around the same time with a shared vision of serving the human community in its diversity. The Commonwealth Charter, which brings together the values, principles and aspirations that unite the Commonwealth are ones that find common cause with UNESCO and its vision. The variety within the Commonwealth, embracing all continents and descriptions of human communities, already makes it a template of the whole world. At the heart of the Commonwealth is an assertion that democracy, inclusive development and our diversity in all its richness are the three stable pillars on which our futures lie. We are a values-based organisation. Our association is not only about member governments; it is also about the 80-odd professional associations and other bodies through whom also our fundamental preoccupation lies with the welfare and dignity of each and all Commonwealth citizens wherever they call home. Serving them through strengthened national institutions and building social and national resilience, and advocating the cause of small and vulnerable states globally in diverse areas is our core strength. This is all well aligned with UNESCO and its missions."
