Let us be the change we want to see
12 August 2011
As the world celebrates International Youth Day on 12 August 2011, Commonwealth Deputy Secretary-General Mmasekgoa Masire-Mwamba has called on governments, the private sector and civil society organisations to continue prioritising youth development and empowerment. Mrs Masire-Mwamba said: “To the youth this year, my message is simple: if you wish the world to change, let the change begin with you. This is an individual and personal call to live and work with purpose, knowing that perhaps the greatest need in the world today is for young people who are willing to get involved, to commit, to give back, and to support actions that will make our world better.” This year’s International Youth Day and its theme ‘Change Our World’ marks the end of the UN-designated International Year of Youth from 12 August 2010 to 12 August 2011. The Pan-Commonwealth Youth Caucus, which represents young people from the Commonwealth’s 54 member countries, said in a statement: “We are confident that we can learn from yesterday, challenge today's world and build a better tomorrow. “We call on decision-makers to recognise and engage with young people to make positive change. Let us be the change we want to see.”
