International Anti-Corruption Day in Mauritius provides ‘critical reflection’
20 December 2017
The Commonwealth joined Mauritius’ Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) to commemorate the UN’s International Anti-Corruption Day on December 9.  The theme for the day was “Values and the Fight Against Corruption”.   It brought together 600 stakeholders from all spheres of society who are committed to fight against corruption. The Commonwealth’s Adviser on Public Sector Governance, Dr Roger Koranteng, spoke on the importance of ethical values in creating a fair and just society. He also presented the winner of the national essay competition on anti-corruption, Marie Angele Anne-Gaelle Christophe, with a certificate. As part of the week-long programme to observe International Anti-Corruption Day, the Commonwealth and the ICAC also delivered a three-day training course for senior managers of law enforcement agencies in Mauritius.  It focussed on inter-agency collaboration in the fight against corruption and money laundering.  Participants came from the Mauritius Revenue Authority, Financial Intelligence Unit, Mauritius Police Force, Gambling Regulatory Authority, Integrity Reporting Services Agency, Anti-Terrorist Cell, Financial Services Commission, Bank of Mauritius and the Mauritius Prison Service. Dr Navin Beekarry, Director-General, Independent Commission Against Corruption, said: “We wish to thank the Commonwealth Secretariat for the wonderful training programme. Dr Koranteng’s experience and the knowledge that he shared with us provided critical reflection about what we are doing, the means and ways of achieving our goals more effectively and efficiently. We look forward to further reinforcing our partnership with the Commonwealth next year.”
