Secretary-General commits to the Caribbean
30 May 2018
Commonwealth Secretary-General Patricia Scotland has reaffirmed her commitment to collaborating with leaders in the Caribbean following a visit to the region. During her mission, the Secretary-General met with leaders to discuss how commitments and agreements made at the 2018 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) can accelerate sustainable development in the region. “Speaking to the leaders in the Caribbean, I felt the weight of shared concerns such as climate change and economy-decimating hurricanes,” said the Secretary-General. “But what is clear is that they are absolutely committed to collaborating with the Commonwealth to address these issues.” “Coming from London on the heels of what was a most successful CHOGM, I was able to offer the Caribbean a full platter of practical initiatives such as our Blue Charter, which lays the foundation for strong collaboration on action to protect our ocean with champions leading on specific issues such as coral reef regeneration, mangrove restoration and ridding the ocean of plastics.” The Secretary-General also signed new agreements with the Caribbean community to improve cooperation on climate change and others challenges.
