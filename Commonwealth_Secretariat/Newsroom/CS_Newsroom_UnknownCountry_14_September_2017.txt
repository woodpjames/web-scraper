Sun removes 'untruthful, misleading and improper' articles
14 September 2017
A British newspaper has agreed to remove from its website a series of articles which sought to discredit both the Commonwealth Secretariat, Secretary-General Patrica Scotland, and others associated with them. The Secretary-General had complained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO) about inaccuracies and untruths written in the Sun between August 2016 and January 2017. In a negotiated settlement, the Sun agreed to remove the online articles and not to repeat some of the claims it had made. A spokesman for the Secretariat said, "We maintained that the allegations made by the Sun were untruthful, misleading and improper. We're glad that the Sun has decided to remove the articles from its website and that we can put this unfortunate episode behind us. " In accepting the offer to remove the offending articles, the Secretary-General maintains the right to issue fresh complaints to both the Sun and IPSO should the newspaper repeat the allegations complained of in any form.
