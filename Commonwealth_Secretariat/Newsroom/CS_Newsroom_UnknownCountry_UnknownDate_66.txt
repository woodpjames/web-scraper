At this ceremony, the Commonwealth Youth Worker of the Year in each region will be revealed. The overall Commonwealth Youth Worker of the Year, drawn from the regional winners, will also be named. The ceremony falls during Commonwealth Youth Work Week 2016, held from 7-13 November, under the theme ‘Empowering young people through sport and arts’. Please note, the ceremony is invite-only.
