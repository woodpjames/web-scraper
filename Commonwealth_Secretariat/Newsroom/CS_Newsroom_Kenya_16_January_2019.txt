Commonwealth Secretary-General statement on the terror attack in Kenya
16 January 2019
The Commonwealth Secretary-General has strongly condemned the cowardly terrorist attack on innocent civilians at Dusit Complex in Nairobi, Kenya yesterday. She said: â€œThe Commonwealth and people of goodwill throughout the world stand in solidarity with the people of Kenya at this time. We are united in our determination that the terrorists will not succeed in their fruitless mission to undermine our Commonwealth Charter values of peace, inclusiveness, tolerance, respect and understanding. We offer our condolences to the families and loved ones of the victims of this attack, and our thoughts and prayers are with the injured for a speedy recovery. I know that in the true spirit of the Commonwealth family our member countries will provide such support as may be required by the Government of Kenya and all those working in support of the people of Kenya at this time of need and distress. "Commonwealth Heads of Government, at their meeting in London in 2018, condemned violent extremism in all its forms and encouraged all Commonwealth member countries actively to share expertise and best practice in confronting the challenges of violent extremism and terrorism. "I shall shortly be speaking with the authorities in Kenya to discuss how we might be of assistance in the aftermath of this terrible crime."
