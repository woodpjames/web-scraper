Statement by Commonwealth Secretary-General Patricia Scotland on attacks in London
4 June 2017
My condolences, thoughts and prayers are with the government and people of the United Kingdom following the latest terror attack in London last night. On a Saturday evening, when friends and families were enjoying a night out or going about their innocent business, they faced another assault on their freedom. But once again they showed their resilience, defiance and unity in the face of adversity. Stories are emerging of those who ran heroically towards the attackers trying to help those being stabbed, sustaining life-threatening injuries as a result. We are hearing how strangers offered shelter to those unable to get home in the confusing aftermath. These acts of kindness show why terror will never win. The UK knows it is a valued member of the Commonwealth and today the Commonwealth family stands in solidarity with all of its people in their hour of grief. All the flags of the Commonwealth and that of the Commonwealth will be flying at half-mast. The attackers' aim is to try to drive a wedge between us, but they will not win. We will do everything to defeat those who wish to cower us through fear and confusion. We remain strong together and united with people of faith and those of none, while we work tirelessly to counter the efforts of violent extremists across the Commonwealth.
