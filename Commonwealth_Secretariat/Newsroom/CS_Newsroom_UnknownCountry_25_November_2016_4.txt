Red Wednesday and a Commonwealth united against religious hatred
25 November 2016
A campaign to recognise those persecuted or killed in acts of religious hatred saw both sides of the frontage of the UK Houses of Parliament illuminated in red this week. Commonwealth Secretary-General Patricia Scotland gave her backing to the Red Wednesday campaign, which saw churches, mosques and synagogues and other landmarks around the United Kingdom lit up with red light on 23 November 2016. She said: “The Commonwealth has long been a torchbearer for tolerance, respect, understanding, moderation and religious freedom. These values are articulated in the Charter of the Commonwealth and are fundamental to the achievement of peace and prosperity.” “As a Commonwealth family, we are united with the victims and families of those devastated by religiously motivated violence, in grief, solidarity and also hope that we may overcome division. Hate is a pernicious and self-defeating feeling which has no place in society today.” “I very much hope that this wonderful campaign will grow and spread to other Commonwealth countries,” she added. #UKParliament is illuminate red to mark the #RedWednesday campaign which recognises those persecuted or killed in acts of religious hatred pic.twitter.com/dFpgMPvG1Z — UK Parliament (@UKParliament) November 23, 2016
