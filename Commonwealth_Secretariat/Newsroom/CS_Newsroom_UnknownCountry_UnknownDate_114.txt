A conversation on 'The Commonwealth in the Unfolding Global Trade Landscape'
UnknownDate
A high-level panel discussion on the Commonwealth in the unfolding global trade landscape. The conversation will draw on the main highlights and findings of the Commonwealth Trade Review, which was launched at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in Malta in November 2015. Fundamental changes are taking place in the global trade landscape, and the Commonwealth, with its diverse membership, is coming to terms with these changes. This shifting landscape offers challenges and opportunities for Commonwealth countries to expand their trade-both between members and their overall trade. This event will be an opportunity to discuss the Review's key findings with Commonwealth High Commissioners and other London-based stakeholders.
