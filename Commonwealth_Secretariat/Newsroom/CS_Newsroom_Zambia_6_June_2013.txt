Commonwealth Deputy Secretary-General to visit Zambia
6 June 2013
Mrs Masire-Mwamba will take part in activities of the Commonwealth Youth Centre in Lusaka - one of the Commonwealth’s four regional youth centres around the world – where she will engage with beneficiaries of the organisation’s training programmes for young people. The Deputy Secretary-General will also meet senior government officials and other stakeholders. Her visit is the first by a senior Commonwealth official to the country since a small team from the Commonwealth Secretariat visited Zambia on a fact-finding mission in March this year. Speaking in London ahead of the Deputy Secretary-General’s visit, Richard Uku, the Secretariat's Director of Communications and Public Affairs and Commonwealth Spokesperson, said Mrs Masire-Mwamba hopes to hold consultations with various interlocutors while in Zambia. "We look forward to continued partnership with Zambia in advancing the Commonwealth’s fundamental values, including democracy and good governance, sustainable development and respect for diversity,” Mr Uku said.
