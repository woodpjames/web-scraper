11 August 2015
Abuja, Nigeria 11 August 2015 Commonwealth Secretary-General Kamalesh Sharma met with the President of Nigeria today - their first encounter since Muhammadu Buhari was elected in March. The Secretary-General reviewed elements of the President’s inaugural address that offered potential for partnership, both within Nigeria and in the wider Commonwealth context. The two leaders agreed that areas for possible collaboration included combatting radicalisation and violent extremism, building transparency and accountable financial management, tackling youth unemployment, and strengthening public institutions to improve resilience and increase democratic accountability. “The recent democratic change of government in Nigeria was historic,” stated the Secretary-General. “It was a high moment for both the Commonwealth and Africa.” He recalled with satisfaction the strong record of collaboration between the Commonwealth and Nigeria on election management, debt management, trade, and police professionalism plus the significant and longstanding contributions made by Nigeria and Nigerians to advance the values of democracy, development, and respect for diversity as set out in the Commonwealth Charter.
