This draft charter will now be submitted to Commonwealth Heads of Government for approval. The ministers agreed to all the remaining recommendations of the Commonwealth Eminent Persons Group, aimed at sharpening impact, strengthening networks and raising the Commonwealth's profile. These recommendations will now also go to Commonwealth leaders for approval. Ministers concluded on previously discussed options for enhancing Commonwealth political values. The Group agreed on a range of measures to support CMAG in its enhanced mandate and the Secretary-General's 'Good Offices for Peace work.' The meeting produced traction on developments for a new Strategic Plan for the Commonwealth Secretariat. This is a plan that will see the Secretariat focus on its areas of comparative advantage, as a modern, dynamic organisation addressing contemporary challenges.
