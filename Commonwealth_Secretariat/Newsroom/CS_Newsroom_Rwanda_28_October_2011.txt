Rwanda supports reform of the Commonwealth
28 October 2011
Rwanda is glad to be able to contribute to the process of reform in the Commonwealth, the country’s leader, President Paul Kagame, told Commonwealth Heads of Government at the start of their three-day meeting which began in Perth, Australia, on 28 October 2011. He said Rwanda is pleased to be part of the 54-member association because “we espouse the values and principles that have shaped the Commonwealth and earned it respect and esteem”. Mr Kagame said the citizens of Rwanda know from experience that peace, security and equal opportunities for all – including gender equality – are important pillars of good governance, and a strong basis for socio-economic development. “The economic and political challenges that the global community has witnessed recently provide more than enough evidence regarding the degree of our interdependence,” said Mr Kagame. He added: “Co-operation and partnership are key; the kind where the rules to be followed are clear, fair and equally applicable to all. And what supports this is mutual respect and understanding – a calling that the Commonwealth of Nations is known to aspire to. We are happy to associate with this attitude and practice.” The Rwandan president pledged support and contribution to the collective efforts to make the Commonwealth a stronger and more dynamic organisation.
