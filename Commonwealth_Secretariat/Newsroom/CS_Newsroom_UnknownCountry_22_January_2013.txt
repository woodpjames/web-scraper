‘Opportunity through Enterprise’ – the Commonwealth theme for 2013
22 January 2013
This year’s Commonwealth theme, to be launched on Commonwealth Day, encourages imagination, creativity, and a positive attitude to grasp the opportunities of our time – at home or with partners beyond our borders, Commonwealth Secretary-General Kamalesh Sharma said today. Mr Sharma said: “'Opportunity through Enterprise’, our 2013 Commonwealth theme, encourages us all to celebrate the ways in which talent and innovation can be supported and put to the best use possible." The Secretary-General urged young people specifically to embrace the 2013 theme to find and maximise innovative opportunities. "Enterprise is about creativity of the mind, as well as a positive attitude, industriousness and energy. National political and economic leadership should nurture it. “The combination in enterprise of creativity and a can-do spirit creates opportunities to improve lives and livelihoods. “The modern Commonwealth is built on the shared values, principles and goals in our Commonwealth Charter. Converting those words into practical action and results can be achieved and indeed accelerated by taking full advantage of opportunities created by enterprising Commonwealth citizens, organisations and governments,” the Secretary-General concluded. Commonwealth Day is traditionally celebrated in events around the world in Commonwealth countries including multi-faith observance services, such as the Observance at Westminster Abbey in London attended by HM Queen Elizabeth II, Head of the Commonwealth. This year, Commonwealth Day will be celebrated across the world on Monday, 11 March. Since 1977, Commonwealth Day has been celebrated on the second Monday in March each year – a day when schools are open in all Commonwealth countries – and is an opportunity to promote understanding on democratic values, the dignity of citizens and opportunities for youth across the Commonwealth. #CWTheme
