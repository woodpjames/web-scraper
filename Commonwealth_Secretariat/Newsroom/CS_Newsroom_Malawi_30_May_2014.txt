The Commonwealth Secretary-General, Kamalesh Sharma, has noted the announcement by the Malawi Electoral Commission (MEC) that it plans to release the results of the recent tripartite elections today, 30 May, within eight days from the last day of polling as required by the law, unless directed otherwise by the relevant court. The Secretary-General has taken positive note of the MEC’s desire to follow due process and respect the rule of law, as well as to investigate and redress the irregularities that have come to light. He calls on all stakeholders to continue to co-operate with and support the MEC in this regard at this critical time. Mr Sharma also reiterated that due process and the rule of law should be upheld in addressing any electoral challenges or disputes. Mr Sharma reaffirmed his hope that the people of Malawi will remain calm and maintain public order, and allow the electoral process to be properly concluded. “It is in the interest of the nation that the stakeholders in Malawi resolve any differences peacefully, through dialogue, and that they approach the outcome of these elections in a conciliatory manner," Mr Sharma said.
