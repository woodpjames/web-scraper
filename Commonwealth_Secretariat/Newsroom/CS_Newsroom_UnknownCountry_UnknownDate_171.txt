Post-2015: Say Yes to Youth Goal
UnknownDate
There are over 1.8 billion young people in the world, many of whom endure pervasive inequality and inadequate social, political and economic opportunities. As global policymakers look to agree a set of sustainable development targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the Commonwealth is calling for the adoption of a Youth Goal. A Youth Goal would ensure the economic, social and political empowerment and participation of young people and help this generation contribute to all aspects of national development, as active participants, champions and custodians. Join the campaign for a Youth Goal. At the World Conference on Youth on 8 May 2014, Katherine Ellis, Youth Director of The Commonwealth, discussed the issue with Alain Sibenaler, UNFPA Representative and a host of other panellists. People sent in their questions for the panellists usingÂ #Yes2YouthGoal. Visit the event page.
