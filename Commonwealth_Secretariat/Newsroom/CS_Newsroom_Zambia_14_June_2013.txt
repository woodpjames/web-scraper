Deputy Secretary-General concludes visit to Zambia
14 June 2013
Commonwealth Deputy Secretary-General Mmasekgoa Masire-Mwamba recently concluded a three-day visit to Zambia, during which she was received by President Michael Sata and Vice President Guy Scott. She also paid a courtesy call on Zambiaâ€™s founding President, Dr Kenneth David Kaunda, and met senior government officials, leaders of opposition political parties and civil society representatives. In all her meetings, Mrs Masire-Mwamba briefed her hosts on current Commonwealth priorities, including the forthcoming Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting taking place in Colombo, Sri Lanka this November, the organisation's reform and renewal agenda, and its new Strategic Plan of advancing Commonwealth values of democracy, development and respect for diversity. Mrs Masire-Mwamba offered to use the services of the Commonwealth Secretary-General's Good Offices to facilitate dialogue between the government and the opposition with a view to addressing contentious issues that have arisen between both sides and which have marked the Zambian political and media landscape for some time now. The Commonwealth Secretariat expects to continue to work closely with Zambia, as an important founding member of the modern Commonwealth. The Deputy Secretary-General also visited the Commonwealth Youth Programme Africa Centre, where young people from the 19 Commonwealth African member countries obtain training in business, entrepreneurial, management and life skills.
