Commonwealth ministers discuss next step to resolve Guyana-Venezuela border controversy
22 September 2017
Commonwealth ministers have met on the margins of the United Nations to discuss the decades-old border controversy between Guyana and Venezuela. The Commonwealth Ministerial Group on Guyana thanked the UN Secretary-General's Good Offices for all its efforts to try to resolve it. Ministers welcomed the UN Secretary-General's decision that he would ask the International Court of Justice to try to resolve the controversy, unless Guyana and Venezuela jointly asked him not to do so, if there wasn't significant progress by the end of the year. They renewed their "unequivocal and collective support" of Commonwealth members states for Guyana. You can read the full statementÂ here.
