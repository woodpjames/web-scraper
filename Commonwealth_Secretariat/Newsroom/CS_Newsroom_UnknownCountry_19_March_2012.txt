How does your food represent your culture?
19 March 2012
Thank you to all those who sent in submissions from every region of the Commonwealth. 2012 Commonwealth Theme ‘Connecting Cultures’ celebrates the diversity of the Commonwealth and its role in bringing together many different peoples on the basis of shared visions and values. We received photos of traditional cultural meals eaten in your country and special foods that commemorate events; stories about how you learned to cook and where your recipes originated; Facebook and Twitter messages about your traditional breakfasts; and even pictures of a specially-made Commonwealth egg cosy. Visit the Connecting Cultures website for a selection of this month’s entries and to see how you can take part in this month’s new topic: traditional cultural dress and how its influenced fashion in your country.
