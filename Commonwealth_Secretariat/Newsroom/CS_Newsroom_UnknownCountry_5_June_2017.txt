Commonwealth Secretariat to hold minute silence for London terror victims
5 June 2017
Flags are flying at half-mast at the headquarters of the Commonwealth at Marlborough House in London today. It is the third time the flags of all 52 Commonwealth nations and the Commonwealth standard  have been lowered following terror attacks in the United Kingdom this year. Tomorrow, staff at the Secretariat will join the nation in holding one minute’s silence as a mark of respect for those who have died and been injured in this and other attacks around the Commonwealth. Secretary-General Patricia Scotland said, “Our thoughts and prayers are with the UK government and its people. We in the Commonwealth family stand shoulder to shoulder and united against all who would seek to divide us. The one  minute-silence and the lowering of all the flags to half-mast are symbols which send a strong message to those who would seek to change our way of life through acts of terror. Nothing will come between us because we are a strong family of nations, with shared values, a shared history and the shared aim of doing everything to defeat those who wish to cause fear and confusion.”
