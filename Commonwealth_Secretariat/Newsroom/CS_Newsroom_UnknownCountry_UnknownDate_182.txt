Commonwealth Broadcasting Association General Conference
UnknownDate
Theme: 'Hitting the Right Note: the Role of Music in PSB' Providing music-based content for radio and TV can require high-level expenditure that’s difficult for a public broadcaster to defend. But music can also be a driver to engage broad audiences in the shared public media space that is Public Service Broadcasting (PSB). The 2014 CBA General Conference will focus on the value of music for public broadcasters, exploring issues such as copyright, music formats and the debate about new platforms for accessing and sharing music. BBC Scotland will host the event at their Pacific Quay headquarters in Glasgow. We hope that many of you will join us to share how you use music to reach and engage audiences. There will be opportunities for networking, discussion and debate – all interspersed with plenty of music of course! Registration will open in the new year, but in the meantime please feel free to submit your details to the CBA for pre-registration to be kept up to date.
