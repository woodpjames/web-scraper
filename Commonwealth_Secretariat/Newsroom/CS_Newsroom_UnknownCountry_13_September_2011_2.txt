Nearly 1,000 media register to attend CHOGM
13 September 2011
Nearly 1,000 journalists have registered to cover the 2011 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in Australia’s Indian Ocean city of Perth. Journalists and their media logistics teams are expected to descend on Perth from 23 October, ahead of CHOGM and parallel events, which include the business, youth and people’s forums. Authorities in Western Australia have also laid out an eight-day arts and culture festival from 23 to 30 October with the revitalised Perth Cultural Centre - which will be known as 'The People’s Space' during CHOGM 2011 - as the centrepiece. Organisers said two major sporting events would also be held in the week preceding CHOGM 2011. On 23 October, the top two netball teams in the world, the New Zealand Silver Ferns and the Australian Netball Diamonds, will participate in a match as part of the Holden Netball Test Series. This will be preceded by a match between South Africa and Malawi. A newly formatted hockey tournament known as the International Super Series, featuring men’s and women’s competitions, would also be played from 20 to 23 October, featuring teams from Australia, India, Malaysia, New Zealand and Pakistan. The CHOGM 2011 Taskforce said accredited media should seek to book their accommodation as soon as possible to avoid disappointment. “The Australian Government can only guarantee accommodation through the CHOGM 2011 accreditation website until 21 September 2011,” said a spokesperson at Australia’s CHOGM 2011 Taskforce.
