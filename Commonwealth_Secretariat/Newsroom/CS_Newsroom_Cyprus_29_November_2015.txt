Cyprus to chair Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group
29 November 2015
Leaders at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in Malta today elected Cyprus to chair the newly reconstituted Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG). Guyana will serve as vice chair of the Group, which guards democracy and rights in the Commonwealth. India, Kenya, Namibia, New Zealand, Pakistan, Solomon Islands, and Malta are also part of the Group, which will serve a two-year term. Established in 1995, CMAG assesses infringements of the Commonwealth’s shared political values, and deals with persistent or serious violations. The Group has the power to suspend a member country or even recommend expulsion from the Commonwealth. The CHOGM communique, issued today, said: “Heads adopted the Report of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG) and noted the Group’s efforts to implement its strengthened mandate that was agreed by Heads in 2011. Recognising the important role played by CMAG in safeguarding the Commonwealth’s fundamental political values, Heads encouraged CMAG to take further steps to implement this strengthened mandate.”
