Summit for Commonwealth-Asia young entrepreneurs
UnknownDate
The Commonwealth Alliance of Young Entrepreneurs-Asia (CAYE-Asia) hosts an annual summit to provide a platform for engagement and networking among regional young entrepreneurs. The summit showcases innovation at work through field visits and meetings with leading industry officials. Held under the theme ‘Business across Borders’, delegates will discuss opportunities and make commitments aimed at boosting trade and commerce in Commonwealth Asia. The summit will also serve as a celebration of five years of sustained work that the Alliance has carried out in the Commonwealth Asia region, covering India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Malaysia, Singapore, Sri Lanka, and Brunei, as well as Nepal, a non-Commonwealth observer country. Highlights include a pitching competition, field visits to London-based companies and business incubators, and a full day event at Marlborough House with high-level speakers, including Commonwealth Secretary-General Patricia Scotland.
