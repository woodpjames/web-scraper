Following an invitation from the National Electoral Commission (NEC) of the Republic of Sierra Leone, the Commonwealth Secretary-General, Mr Kamalesh Sharma, constituted an Observer Group for the 17 November 2012 National and Local Council Elections in Sierra Leone. In line with usual practice, the Secretary-General sent an Assessment Mission to Sierra Leone to evaluate the prevailing situation as well as the pre-electoral environment, prior to his final decision on whether to constitute a Commonwealth Observer Group. The Assessment Team was in the country from 10 to 15 September 2012. The Commonwealth Observer Group was led by Mr Olara Otunnu, former Foreign Minister of Uganda and former United Nations Under-Secretary General and Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict, and comprised nine eminent persons. The Observer Group was supported by a five-person staff team from the Commonwealth Secretariat.
