CABOS to hold annual meeting in London
3 April 2012
The Commonwealth Advisory Body on Sport (CABOS) will meet in London from 3 to 4 April 2012 to discuss strengthening sport for development and peace (SDP) initiatives and protecting the integrity of sport. The 14-member group, appointed by the Commonwealth Secretary-General, will also prepare recommendations for the 6th Commonwealth Sports Ministers Meeting to be held in July 2012. The CABOS meeting will specifically address co-ordinating and developing SDP in the Commonwealth; advancing human rights and protection issues in and through sports; and better engaging the wider development sector in SDP efforts. In addition it will cover governance, transparency and relationships between sport stakeholders and the emerging issue of match fixing and illegal betting. CABOS advises the Commonwealth Secretariat and Commonwealth governments on sport policy, particularly with respect to SDP. The Secretariatâ€™s SDP programme, based within the Youth Affairs Division, works with CABOS to support member governments to integrate sport into development policy, with a particular focus on young people. The Secretariat co-ordinates its SDP work with key international bodies, including the Commonwealth Games Federation, the UN Sport for Development and Peace International Working Group and Sport and Development Platform, and leading Commonwealth governments in this area. SDP involves the intentional use of deliberately planned sport interventions to contribute to international development goals, including basic education, gender equality, the reduction of non-communicable diseases and the prevention of HIV/AIDS. SDP is also used in peace-building efforts and to contribute to addressing difficulties arising from humanitarian crises and in conflict and post-conflict situations.
