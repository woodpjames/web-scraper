Celebrating and connecting the Commonwealth family
16 February 2018
An event which brings together the wide range of organisations that make up the Commonwealth takes place in London next month. In the first of a series of events taking place this year CommonTies, which works to engage and support youth leaders from across the Commonwealth, will host an interactive fair, panel discussion and hear from guest speakers as part of the event to showcase the work of the organisations across the 53 member states. ‘Powering our CommonTies: Connect, Engage and Contribute’ will take place at the Royal Overseas League in London on 14 March. More than 80 affiliated organisations, charities and associations currently make up the Commonwealth family. They work plays a crucial role in representing the Commonwealth’s 2.4bn citizens. Head of Social Policy Development at the Commonwealth Secretariat, Layne Robinson said, “We are once again thrilled to be hosting this event, which celebrates the important role that our networks play right across the 53 countries. “Young people are a big part of this, with more than 60 percent of the Commonwealth’s citizens under the age of 30. That’s why it’s so important that young people join these organisations and play an active part in shaping their future.” Mr Robinson added, “We hope this event will highlight the many ways people can associate with, subscribe or generally explore opportunities to be part of a thriving Commonwealth.” Information about the event Register for the event Join the conversation online with @CommonwealthSec and @ComSecYouth by using: #CommonTies #CommonwealthYouth #Commonwealth
