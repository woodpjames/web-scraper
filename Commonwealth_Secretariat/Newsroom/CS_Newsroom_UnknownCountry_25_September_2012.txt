Commonwealth Secretary-General in New York for Foreign Ministers’ Meeting
25 September 2012
The meeting will review the Commonwealth’s political work and priorities agreed by leaders. Ministers will be updated on Sri Lanka’s preparations for hosting the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting next year. They will also consider the Commonwealth Secretariat’s new Strategic Plan, which outlines the organisation’s scope of work over the next four years, beginning in January 2013. Mr Sharma said: “The Secretariat will undergo a fundamental transformation in the way we work, with a view to sharpening our impact and relevance, and to align the organisation and its strengths with contemporary times.” In New York, foreign ministers will hear from the task force appointed to consider outstanding recommendations made by the Eminent Persons Group. Their report ‘A Commonwealth of the People – Time for Urgent Reform’ was presented to Heads of Government in Perth, Australia last October. On 28 September, the Secretary-General will convene the 38th meeting of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group, which monitors adherence of member states to the association’s fundamental political values.
