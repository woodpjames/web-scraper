Secretary-General Patricia Scotland has paid a courtesy call on the president of Namibia, His Excellency Hage Geingob, who is on official visit to the United Kingdom. The Secretary-General and the president, together with his ministerial delegation, consisting of the deputy prime minister and minister of international relations and cooperation, minister of finance, minister of mines and energy and the high commissioner of Namibia, discussed a range of issues. They included desertification, climate change and its effects on small states, good governance, gender equality, business investment and trade facilitation in the Commonwealth and making the most of its unique potential. The Secretary-General reiterated the importance of putting the Commonwealth at the service of its member states and shared her vision to encourage easier and faster mutual assistance among them. “We share a lot in common. Our language. Our cultures. Our laws. Working together we can help one another,” said Secretary-General Scotland. “We should never forget that together we have access to a huge Commonwealth market and can reach more than two billion people.” HE President Geingob reinforced the great value Namibia places on its membership of the Commonwealth and said he continued to support the Secretary-General and her reform agenda. He said the Commonwealth could play a key role in supporting Namibia’s aspirations for development, good governance, transparency, accountability and the declared “war against poverty.”
