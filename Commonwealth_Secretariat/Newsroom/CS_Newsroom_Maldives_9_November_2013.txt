Commonwealth Special Envoy to Maldives urges swift conclusion to electoral process
9 November 2013
The Commonwealth Secretary-General’s Special Envoy, Sir Donald McKinnon, noted this evening that he was pleased that the 9 November Maldives presidential election was able to take place today in a calm and peaceful manner. “All initial reports suggest that this was a good election, and I look forward to hearing the more definitive reports of domestic and international observers shortly. The Elections Commission should be commended for its consistency in delivering another well-managed and credible election. “I commend all stakeholders for ensuring that the Maldivian people were able to have their say at the ballot box today in a seemingly free and fair manner. “It is important now that the electoral process move forward swiftly to its conclusion, with the holding of the second round. “It is unreasonable and unacceptable for parties to continue to demand changes to an agreed election date. Voters deserve better from their leaders and a greater degree of predictability over something as serious as a presidential election. “Any further delays would create uncertainty for the voters, place extra demands on the Elections Commission and lower people’s confidence in the country’s democratic institutions.”
