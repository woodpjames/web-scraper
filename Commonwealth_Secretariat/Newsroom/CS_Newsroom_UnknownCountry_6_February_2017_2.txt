Secretariat congratulates Queen on her sapphire jubilee
6 February 2017
It is 65 years today since The Queen acceded to the throne, and marks her sapphire jubilee as Head of the Commonwealth. Congratulating Her Majesty, Secretary-General Patricia Scotland said, "Her Majesty The Queen has been an inspirational monarch. It's clear how much she values the Commonwealth, how dear the Commonwealth family is to her heart, and in return how much the people of our 52 member states value and love her. I'd like to thank Her Majesty not only on behalf of the Commonwealth, but personally as well. Her wisdom, advice and wonderful support have been invaluable to me since I was elected to office in April 2016." The Queen will spend the Accession Day, as it is known, at Sandringham, her estate in Norfolk on the east coast of England.
