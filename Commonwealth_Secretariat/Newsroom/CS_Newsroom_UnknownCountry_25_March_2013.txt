Commonwealth explorers officially begin six-month historic polar trek
25 March 2013
The Coldest Journey team have begun their six-month trek across Antarctica marking the official start of the Commonwealth-flagged expedition. The five explorers are undertaking the 2,000 mile journey across the South Pole, in near darkness and with temperatures that could reach minus 90 degrees Celsius in what is considered the last great polar challenge. Sir Ranulph Fiennes, who was leading the expedition, had to withdraw after developing frostbite last month. The expedition aims to raise US$10 million for 'Seeing is Believing' - an international initiative to combat preventative blindness, which operates in 15 Commonwealth countries. The expedition will also enable new scientific research on climate change and its impact on the polar regions. Brian Newham and his team began their remarkable journey across the Antarctic on foot last Thursday and were reported to be making good progress, despite the extreme conditions. Poor weather delayed the scheduled start of the expedition on 21 March. While on the ice, the group will conduct a series of scientific experiments and generate diverse, engaging and real-time educational content for schools through an online work space, competitions and curriculum modules.
