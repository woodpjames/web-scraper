Deputy Secretary-General launches International Public Policy Review at University College London
12 September 2017
‘Borders and Boundaries’ was the theme at University College London’s launch of its journal International Public Policy Review last week.  The keynote speech was delivered by Deputy Secretary-General Josephine Ojiambo. Her speech called for governments, institutions and the private sector to recognise and embrace the increasing complexity of the modern world, and ended with an appeal for a more human, and humane, approach to global citizenship. She emphasized that technology - such as instant communication and data collection - has increased the speed and substance of bilateral and multilateral partnerships as well as technical assistance missions within the Commonwealth. The Deputy Secretary-General pointed to a number of multilateral partnerships in the Caribbean as examples.  They allow public health systems to share data, improve disaster-preparedness, increase flexibility and dynamism, and achieve value for money. Viewing technology as an important enabler for trade, she said: “Many of these innovations offer equal opportunities for developed and developing countries alike; yes, London might be a global hub for FinTech, but soon Nairobi may be, as well. Improved digital infrastructures could soon allow many developing countries to ‘leapfrog’ into the digital age, and create their own fledgling knowledge economies.” The International Public Policy Review is a student-led publication, committed to promoting quality contributions from postgraduate students in the policy and international affairs field, including articles, policy reviews and opinion pieces.
