HRH Prince Harry and Meghan Markle meet youth delegates
18 April 2018
Prince Harry and Meghan Markle spent an hour meeting young people from across the Commonwealth on the final day of the Youth Forum in London today. The Prince and his fianc√©e told delegates they looked forward to seeing the plans and initiatives of the past three days become a reality. In turn, the young people explained how they had worked in groups to develop policy recommendations on projects that can be rolled out across their home countries and the wider Commonwealth. This process had helped to build connections between delegates of different cultural backgounds during the Forum, they added.
