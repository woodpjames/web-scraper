24 September 2015
Commonwealth Secretary-General Kamalesh Sharma has released the report of the Commonwealth Observer Group to Nigeria’s Presidential and National Assembly elections on 28 March 2015. The Commonwealth Observer Group was led by Dr Bakili Muluzi, former President of Malawi. “These elections mark an important step forward for democracy in Africa’s most populous country, and a key member of the Commonwealth,” writes Dr Muluzi in the foreword to the report. “Notwithstanding the organisational and technical deficiencies, the conduct of the Presidential and National Assembly elections was credible, peaceful, transparent and reflected the will of the people of Nigeria.” “Our report includes a number of recommendations which, we believe, could further improve the electoral process in Nigeria. We hope they will be positively considered and implemented,” Dr Muluzi adds. The report has been sent to stakeholders in Nigeria, including the Government, political parties and the Independent National Electoral Commission. Download the report Media Contact:
