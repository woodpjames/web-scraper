Commonwealth Secretary-General congratulates new Antigua and Barbuda Prime Minister
17 June 2014
In a message to Mr Browne, Mr Sharma said he was heartened by the Prime Minister’s announcement of the role youth would play in his Cabinet and development initiatives. The Secretary-General said the Commonwealth, through its vibrant youth programme, also has a strong emphasis on youth leadership and entrepreneurship. Mr Sharma added that the Commonwealth Secretariat remains committed to continuing to provide any assistance that may be needed to support Antigua and Barbuda’s national developmental efforts and to further the Commonwealth’s collectively agreed values and goals. Commonwealth Deputy Secretary-General Deodat Maharaj will attend the CARICOM Summit next month to discuss the collective interests and concerns of Commonwealth small states in important and high-level forthcoming deliberations such as the UN SIDS Summit in Apia, Samoa in September, and the discussions of the UN Post-2015 development framework, to both of which the Commonwealth is making substantive contributions.
