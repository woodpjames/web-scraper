2 February 2012
"We are continuing to watch developments in Maldives closely and have maintained high-level contact with the government and other concerned parties over the last weeks. The Commonwealth is committed to helping its members to uphold the values and principles laid out in the 2009 Affirmation of Commonwealth Values, including the Latimer House Principles on the separation of powers between the three branches of government â€“ the executive, legislative and judiciary. In this context, the Commonwealth Secretariat welcomes the invitation of the Government of Maldives to assist in addressing its current challenges. A Secretariat delegation will visit Maldives shortly for discussions with key interlocutors."
