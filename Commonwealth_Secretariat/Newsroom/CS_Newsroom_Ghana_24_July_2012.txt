24 July 2012
Commonwealth Secretary-General Kamalesh Sharma has expressed his profound sorrow at the passing away of President John Atta Mills of Ghana. In a statement issued in London, Mr Sharma said: "On behalf of the Commonwealth, I convey our deepest condolences to the family of the late President and to the Government and people of Ghana. "President Atta Mills was an inspiring leader of Ghana and a true Commonwealth champion, who will be sorely missed at home and internationally. He was a strong advocate and supporter of the Commonwealth, and our membership benefited enormously from his active participation in Commonwealth life and his wisdom. Ghana, was the first independent nation from Africa to join the modern Commonwealth and made impressive strides under his leadership, in both the fields of democracy and development. I remember with great warmth, my official visit to Ghana in 2009 and the very fruitful interaction that we had. "The Commonwealth stands in solidarity with Ghana at this time of sadness and bereavement. Our thoughts are with the family of President Atta Mills. May his soul rest in peace."
