Statement on Papua New Guinea by Commonwealth Secretariat Spokesperson

â€œWe have been following developments in Papua New Guinea with concern. We deplore the extra-constitutional action taken by some elements in the military, and we are pleased that the situation has been brought under control and the country remains peaceful. The Commonwealth unreservedly rejects any use of military means for domestic political purposes. We urge all concerned to continue to work towards resolving differences through dialogue, and in accordance with the Commonwealth's values."
