14 March 2015
Secretary-General Kamalesh Sharma has written to the Prime Ministers of Vanuatu and Tuvalu following the devastation and loss of life wrought by Cyclone Pam, which struck the South Pacific islands over the past 48 hours. Conveying the solidarity of the entire Commonwealth family, the Secretary-General said he was deeply saddened to hear of the destruction and flooding caused by the category five tropical storm. The Secretary-General, who will be visiting the South Pacific next month, added that the Commonwealth was on standby to assist in the aftermath of the storm. The Commonwealth is at the forefront of addressing the vulnerabilities of its 26 small island states, including through its work on climate change and resilience.
