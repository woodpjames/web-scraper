Condolences for terrorist attack at mosque in London
19 June 2017
Responding to the terrorist attack near Finsbury Park Mosque in London perpetrated early this morning, 19 June 2017, the Secretary-General of the Commonwealth, Patricia Scotland, made the following statement: "On behalf of the Commonwealth, I offer my heartfelt condolences to the government and people of the United Kingdom on the terrorist attack in London today. "This time it was Muslim worshippers in Finsbury Park who were targeted, moments after they had attended evening prayers during the holy month of Ramadan. "The response to this incident shows once again the strength of community, and how, regardless of faith or other affiliation, its members rally and work together in support of those needing medical assistance and emotional comfort. Violence, from whichever quarter, must never be allowed to divide us or divert us from our shared values based, above all, on mutual respect and understanding. "Terrorism is terrorism, and respects no religion or boundaries. We in the Commonwealth family stand united in condemning all such attacks. Motivated by goodwill, we continue to work together as peace-builders towards societies that are fairer and more inclusive, and to defeat those who, driven by hatred, seek to cause fear and division. My thoughts and prayers are with all those affected by this outrage."
