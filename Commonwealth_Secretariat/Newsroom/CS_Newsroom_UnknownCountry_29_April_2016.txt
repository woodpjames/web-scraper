Shortlist for Commonwealth Photographer of the Year announced
29 April 2016
More than 300 photographers entered the Commonwealth’s first ‘Photographer of the Year’ contest. They came from every corner of the Commonwealth, 37 countries in all. Their work was rich and varied, but every photo strove to capture this year’s theme: an inclusive Commonwealth. A selection panel from the Commonwealth Secretariat has now identified a shortlist of 49 excellent entries, using the following criteria to guide them: The shortlisted photos will be judged by two professional photographers, Richard Lewis and Adam Gasson. They will select the Commonwealth Photographer of the Year, who will receive a total £1,000 cash prize. The winner will be announced on 4 May 2016, along with the regional finalists, each of whom will receive a total £500 cash prize. The winning photographs will form part of an exhibition at the Commonwealth Secretariat's headquarters in London throughout 2016. These photos will also feature in a new Commonwealth Calendar for 2017 and be published and promoted on the Commonwealth's website and social media accounts. To view all approved competition entries please visit the Commonwealth Secretariat’s Instagram account. We encourage you to ‘like’ your favourite photos until Monday 2 May 23.59pm BST. The photo that receives the most ‘likes’ on Instagram will receive the ‘Highly Commended Award’ and a cash prize of £100 GBP.
