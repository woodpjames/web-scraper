International Day against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia 2018
17 May 2018
The Commonwealth Charter underscores our common commitment to the values of equality and respect for the protection and promotion of human rights. At the recent Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, Heads agreed that the full social, economic and political participation of all, irrespective of age, sex, disability, race, ethnicity, origin, religion or economic or other status, is essential for democracy and sustainable development to thrive. The 2018 global theme to mark this day is ‘Alliances for Solidarity’. We recognise the importance of multi-stakeholder partnerships as catalysts for respectful and robust dialogue; as platforms for sharing knowledge and expertise to support the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals in the Commonwealth. In working towards full inclusion in the Commonwealth, we continue to work with national human rights commissions, parliamentarians, faith leaders, and human rights defenders. We celebrate one of our most recent successful alliances, with Open for Business. This alliance seeks to strengthen the knowledge base, resources and advocacy capacity to enhance national dialogue.
