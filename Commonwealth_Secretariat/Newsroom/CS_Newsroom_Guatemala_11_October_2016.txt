Ministers encourage Belize and Guatemala to involve International Court to settle border dispute
11 October 2016
Commonwealth ministers have urged all sides involved in the border dispute between Belize and Guatemala to work towards a peaceful resolution and one which is final. A treaty in 1859 established boundaries between the two countries. But in the 1940s Guatemala challenged the settlement. The Commonwealth Ministerial Group on Belize met at the United Nations to discuss the latest developments. The Group said it continued to support Belizeâ€™s claim but encouraged both countries to take the matter to the International Court of Justice in The Hague. Ministers also agreed to share their conclusions with all Commonwealth member states.
