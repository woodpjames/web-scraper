Secretary-General announces new strategy to promote partnerships among accredited organisations
7 December 2018
Secretary-General Patricia Scotland has announced a new approach to boosting collaboration between the 87 accredited Commonwealth organisations, in order to promote democracy, human rights and the rule of law.  She made the announcement at a meeting in Marlborough House, the Commonwealth’s headquarters in London. The Commonwealth family includes 87 partner organisations, officially referred to as ‘Accredited Organisations’ which include a wide range of intergovernmental, professional and civil society organisations. The Secretary-General said the new Commonwealth Secretariat Partnerships Strategy will provide a clear method for engaging with each category of partner from a Results-Based Management perspective. She said: “Most of you will be aware that on becoming Secretary-General, I undertook a review which led to re-organisation of the Secretariat.  Within our reconfigured structure, and so that we are better placed to mobilise the potential of partnerships, a dedicated Innovation and Partnerships team was established within the Strategy, Portfolio and Partnerships Division. “This is an important element in the new structure, because collaborating with international and Commonwealth partners is a key principle in the outcomes-based Strategic Plan to which we are now working and which covers the period until our financial year 2020/21.” She added During the dialogue, representatives received updates on how the accreditation process works, on election observation, the Commonwealth’s cyber declaration and its implementation, as well as an update from the Commonwealth Council for Educational Administration.
