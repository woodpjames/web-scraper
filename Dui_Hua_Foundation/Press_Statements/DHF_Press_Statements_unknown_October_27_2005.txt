Statement on Foreign Observers at Chinese Trials
October 27, 2005
In October 2004, Xiao Yang, President of China’s Supreme People’s Court, paid an official visit to the United States. At a private luncheon hosted by the Asia Foundation in San Francisco, President Xiao stated that, aside from three types of cases explicitly required to be heard in closed sessions (i.e., cases involving juveniles, state secrets, or individual privacy issues), all Chinese trials are open to the public—“including foreigners.”Dui Hua Executive Director John Kamm attended the luncheon. He asked the Supreme People’s Court for a copy of Xiao Yang’s remarks. This was given to him on a visit to Beijing in January 2005.Over the ensuing months, Kamm had several meetings and communications with officials of the Supreme People’s Court and other judicial departments to better understand the policy of allowing foreigners to observe Chinese trials. During Kamm’s most recent trip to Beijing and Guangzhou (October 17 – 25, 2005), a good understanding of the policy was achieved, as follows:Although as a matter of Chinese law foreigners should be allowed to attend Chinese trials, as a matter of practice only trials involving foreigners as defendants or (in civil cases) claimants have been open to foreigners. Representatives of foreign governments whose citizens are tried for crimes committed in China can attend trials in accordance with agreements between China and the foreign countries concerned.The Dui Hua Foundation
