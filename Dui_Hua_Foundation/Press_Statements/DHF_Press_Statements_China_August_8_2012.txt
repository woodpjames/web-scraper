August 8, 2012
HONG KONG (August 9, 2012) — Dui Hua Executive Director John Kamm finalized details of Dui Hua’s third Juvenile Justice Expert Exchange with China’s Supreme People’s Court (SPC) during his just completed visit to Beijing. At 12:00–2:00 PM on Tuesday, August 14, Kamm will be in Hong Kong to discuss the upcoming exchange and the need to continue results-oriented dialogue with China in the spirit of partnership and human rights.The 2012 exchange will bring a delegation of Chinese judges to the United States in September to explore the use of custodial and non-custodial measures. Three of the judges work for the SPC Research Office that is charged with writing the judicial interpretation for new juvenile criminal procedures effective January 1, 2013.Dui Hua’s Juvenile Justice Expert Exchanges in 2008 and 2010 (PDF) contributed to the drafting of the juvenile criminal procedures that were introduced in recent revisions to China’s Criminal Procedure Law—evidence that China’s legal exchanges with the West are an important medium for change.Juvenile justice reform is one of the most important legal reforms to take place in China in decades—affecting the lives of tens of thousands of Chinese youth. It also provides a model for reform relevant to other areas of the Chinese criminal justice system.The talk will be held at the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, 1904 Bank of America Tower, 12 Harcourt Road, Central. AmCham members and non-members are encouraged to attend. The cost of entry is HK$250 for members and HK$350 for non-members.
