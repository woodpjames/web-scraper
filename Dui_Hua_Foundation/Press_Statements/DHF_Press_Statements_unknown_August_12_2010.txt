Dui Hua Makes Research Products Available to Wider Audience
August 12, 2010
SAN FRANCISCO (August 12, 2010) – The Dui Hua Foundation is pleased to announce that it is making Occasional Publications (OP), a core limited-distribution research product issued from 1999 to 2008, available to a wider audience as both a print set and a CD-ROM. Before being retired, the OPs were sent to a small number of professionals worldwide who monitor human rights and criminal justice in China. Dui Hua is now offering governments, academic libraries, research institutions, human rights organizations, and interested individuals the chance to add this unique resource to their collections.With 27 volumes covering nearly 2,000 pages, the OPs represent the fruits of Dui Hua’s pioneering research into open-source documents published or approved of by official government bodies about political and religious crime in China since 1980. The OPs feature an invaluable compilation of data on more than 1,000 detainees—many of whose names were unknown outside of China before their discovery and publication by Dui Hua—as well as groundbreaking research into criminal justice statistics.Having first distributed the OPs as print copies, Dui Hua has developed a digital version that brings together on one fully searchable CD-ROM of the original Chinese-language documents with Dui Hua’s English translations.Buyers of the OP package (print copies plus the CD-ROM) will be sent at no additional cost existing volumes of the research product that replaced the OPs in early 2009—Reference Materials on China’s Criminal Justice System (RM)—and will receive future RM volumes free of charge until the end of 2012.Selected samples from the OP series are available here (PDF).If you are interested in acquiring a set of the Occasional Publications, please send an online inquiry for more information.The Dui Hua Foundation
