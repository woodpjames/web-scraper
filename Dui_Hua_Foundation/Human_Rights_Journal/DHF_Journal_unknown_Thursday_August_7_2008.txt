Op-Ed: "Blinded by the Firewall"

Thursday, August 7, 2008
Executive Director John Kamm submitted an op-ed to The Washington Post that was published on August 7. Entitled “Blinded by the Firewall,” the op-ed makes use of a recent survey of world opinion conducted in 24 countries by the Pew Global Attitudes Project to explore the disconnect between the way Chinese citizens think the world sees China and the far more negative opinions of the country actually held by many people around the globe. Kamm touches on factors that underlie the vast difference in responses, and argues that the positive view of how Chinese people think the world sees the country works against efforts to persuade China’s leaders to take steps to improve human rights.
