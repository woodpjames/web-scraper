The Case of Feng Zhiming: A Question of Accountability

Tuesday, November 8, 2016
On October 18, a court in Inner Mongolia sentenced the former deputy police chief of Hohhot,  Feng Zhiming, to 18 years in prison. Feng’s conviction on charges of corruption, taking bribes, having large amounts of property that cannot be accounted for, and illegal possession of firearms and ammunition made national headlines, in part because of his connection to one of China’s most infamous cases of wrongful conviction and execution of an innocent person—  the case of Huugjilt.
