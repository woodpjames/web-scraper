US-China Rights Dialogue: An Exercise in Insanity?The US Department of State, led by Acting Assistant Secretary Uzra Zeya, participated in the 18th round of the US-China Human Rights Dialogue on July 30-31, 2013. On August 2, the acting assistant secretary gave a press briefing at which she asserted—as is asserted nearly every year—that China’s human rights situation was deteriorating. If that is in fact the case, why does the United States agree, year after year, to continue the dialogue?

Among the banned groups are three Buddhist sects: True Buddha School, Guanyin Famen, and Yuandun Famen. Reasons cited for their prohibition include foreign infiltration, so-called anti-China remarks, and apocalypticism.
