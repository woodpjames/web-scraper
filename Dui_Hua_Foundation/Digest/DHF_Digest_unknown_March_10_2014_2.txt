Chinese Women’s Prisons: Areas for ImprovementAt Dui Hua’s Women in Prison symposium, Renmin University of China Law School Professor Cheng Lei presented independent field research conducted in Chinese women’s prisons and detention centers. Painting a picture of basic quality of life issues, his team focused on physical health and hygiene, marriage and family rights, mental health, and dignity and privacy protection.Bangkok Rules Gain Traction at Hong Kong’s Largest Women’s PrisonDui Hua ended its Women in Prison symposium with a visit to Lo Wu Correctional Institution, Hong Kong’s largest women’s prison. Participants entered the medium-security wing to tour the canteen, workshops, cell blocks, mother and child units, and “psychological gymnasium.” Prior to the visit, Hong Kong Correctional Services undertook an internal review of the prison with an eye towards the Rules for the Treatment of Women Prisoners and Non-Custodial Measures for Women Offenders (the Bangkok Rules), a focus of the symposium.Prisoner UpdateDui Hua recently received information on prisoners in Sichuan and Guangdong from reliable sources in local Chinese governments.
