On that day, troops were ordered into the city to impose martial law and end the more than six weeks of peaceful anti-government demonstrations that had been taking place. Five of these June Fourth prisoners remain incarcerated today, and several are suffering from serious physical or psychological conditions that led to their transfer to Yanqing Prison, Beijing’s special facility for the “old, sick, and infirm.”Clemency on PRC’s 60th anniversary Comes from Provinces, Not Central GovernmentWhile China’s leaders did not issue a national special pardon to mark the 60th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China, thousands of prisoners benefited from provincial-level acts of clemency that coincided with National Day celebrations around the country.Dui Hua welcomes Michael McCune to board; Washington trip includes testimony on China’s human rights, program meetings; Dui Hua moves Hong Kong office, bids farewell to staff member Flora Lee.
