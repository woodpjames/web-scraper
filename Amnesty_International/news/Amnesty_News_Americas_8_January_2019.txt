Guatemala: Termination of CICIG agreement is latest blow to the fight against impunity
8 January 2019
In reaction to the decision of the Guatemalan government to put an end to the agreement with the United Nations on the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG by its initials in Spanish), Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas Director at Amnesty International, said:“This decision from the government of Guatemala is the latest blow to the fight against impunity and clearly shows its worrying lack of willingness to work towards an independent justice system that guarantees the human rights of all people in Guatemala, including the right to justice and adequate reparations for victims of human rights violations.”“Contrary to the government’s claims, the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala is an unprecedented initiative in the region. The achievements obtained with the help of the Commission show that we can fight against impunity and that even the most high-ranking officials can be brought to justice in emblematic cases of corruption and human rights violations.”For further information or to arrange an interview, please contact Duncan Tucker: duncan.tucker@amnesty.org
