Ecuador: Government imposes unjust restrictions on Venezuelans entering the country
29 January 2019
In response to the situation reported at the Rumichaca border crossing between Ecuador and Colombia, where the Ecuadorian authorities are preventing Venezuelans from entering the country, Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas Director at Amnesty International said:“Amnesty International calls on the government of President Lenin Moreno to stop imposing unfair restrictions on Venezuelans trying to enter the country, for example demanding a criminal record certificate. In practice, these measures foment xenophobia and stop people in need of international protection from entering the country.”“These people, among them children, pregnant women and elderly people, are in urgent need of food and shelter and, given the serious human rights crisis now unfolding in Venezuela, it is impossible to obtain the documents that the Ecuadorian authorities are demanding from them, such as a criminal record certificate.”For more information or to arrange an interview, please contact Duncan Tucker, duncan.tucker@amnesty.org
