Gambia: Truth Commission hearings an important step towards justice and reparations
7 January 2019
As the Gambian Truth, Reconciliation and Reparations Commission (TRRC) begins its hearings today, Amnesty International’s West and Central Africa Director Marie-Evelyne Petrus Barry said:“The start of the TRRC hearings is an important initial step towards securing justice, truth and reparations in Gambia and shows a strong commitment by the government to break with a past of systematic human rights violations.“We hope that the testimonies and the information collected during these hearings will enable the truth to be known and made public and contribute to a renewed commitment to justice and accountability for all those Gambians that have been victims of human rights violations for more than 22 years. “The efforts of the government to make this TRRC as inclusive as possible, working with civil society and including all regions of the country, will hopefully give all victims who want to testify the opportunity of expressing themselves publicly and freely.”BackgroundThe Truth, Reconciliation and Reparations Commission (TRRC) was established and launched on 5th October 2018 to look into alleged human rights violations during the 22-year rule of former Gambian President Yahya Jammeh. Its hearings start today in the capital Banjul.
