Kyrgyzstan: Parliament makes welcome first step towards ratifying Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities
20 December 2018
Amnesty International welcomes the first move by the Parliament of Kyrgyzstan to ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD).“This is an important step towards combating the violations of the rights of persons with disabilities. The unanimity of the vote brings hope that the final ratification is fast approaching. When the Convention is ratified, persons with disabilities must be at the front and centre of any action that the government takes to implement the Convention, including on working groups or committees,” said Anna Kirey, Deputy Director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia at Amnesty International.“Amnesty International was honoured to support Kyrgyzstani partners in campaigning for the ratification of CRPD. Together we made tangible progress towards combating prejudices and misconceptions and reinforced the argument that meeting the requirements of the Convention will strengthen the national economy.BackgroundOn 20 December, Zhogorku Kenesh (Kyrgyzstan’s Parliament) passed in first reading a law on ratification of the CRPD. Kyrgyzstan is one of three former Soviet countries that have signed but haven’t ratified the Convention. The two other countries in the region to ratify the Convention are Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.
