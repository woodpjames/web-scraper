Solma Begum finally reaches  home!CH
2017
CHRI celebrates the return of  38 year old Solma Begum to her home in Sunderganj, Bangladesh. It has taken almost a year and sustained effort on behalf of CHRI, police and the media to ensure her joyful reunion with her family. Solma, who went missing three years ago from her home, was found in 2015 in a mentally unstable state by the police at Arambagh, West Bengal. From there, she was sent to a shelter home in Hooghly for treatment. It was only after six months of regular medication and counselling that she was able to identify herself and remember her family. Even then, it has taken one and a half years for her to be verified as a Bangladeshi national and finally repatriated to her family that includes her husband and three children.On Monday, 23rd January 2017 at 4 PM she was greeted by her brother, husband and sisters, who had come to the Benapole /Petrapole border to take her home.Tired of struggling to preserve the hope of seeing her children one day, Solma had repeated, ‘Coming here is easy, going back, difficult’.
