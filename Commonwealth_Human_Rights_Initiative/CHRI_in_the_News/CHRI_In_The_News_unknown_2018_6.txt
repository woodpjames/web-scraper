Mumbai conviction rate: Figures tell a different storyCH
2018
Latest figures belie Maharashtra government’s claims of a crime conviction rate of over 55%.... However, human rights and police reforms experts said the government has not presented a real picture on the conviction rate data for some time. “They just do not put out the real numbers, while mixing the rates from the JMFC and sessions cases. The rate in cases of serious offences of over seven years has just not improved enough. There is room for improvement in implementing major projects, such as coverage of the CCTV network,” said Dolphy D’souza of the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative."
