A shot in the arm: RTI Clinic in Lucknow, Uttar PradeshCH
2017
The cause for transparency and accountability got a shot in the arm on Sunday, 14 May, 2017, when YaishwaryaJ, an NGO in Lucknow, set up an 'RTI Clinic' to help citizens seeking information from the State Government of Uttar Pradesh. The objective of the clinic is to provide ready advice and technical assistance to citizens who use the Right to Information Act to expose corruption and mismanagement of public funds. Copies of CHRI's RTI User Guide in Hindi were distributed free to all participants who attended the awareness camp that launched the RTI clinic last Sunday.Press:  Avadhkiaawaz | Newsindialive | Instantkhabar | Satyamevindia
