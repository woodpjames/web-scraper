2017
To mark World Press Freedom Day (3rd May 2017), the Hoot released a comprehensive report on issues of freedom of speech and expression, and personal freedoms within India. The experience of the last 16 months have demonstrated an atmosphere of shrinking liberty, marked by attacks on those rights that help to facilitate press freedoms: Right to Information and Right to Internet. The report, further, deals with various topics including- attacks on journalists, censorship, dilution of the Right to Information and free speech. CHRI provided the inputs to the RTI section of the report- pointing out the correlation between heightened use of the law and vulnerabilities to attacks, as well as high rate of RTI rejections under the category of ‘Others’.The Report can be found here:
