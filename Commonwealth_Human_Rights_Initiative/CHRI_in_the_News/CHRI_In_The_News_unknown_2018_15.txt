However, the text of these doctrines was not available in the public domain. Now after seven years, since I sought the information under the RTI Act, the CIC has directed the HQ-IDS to make the complete text of these doctrines public within 15 days (see PDF of the CIC’s order).Unlike military strategies and tactics, military doctrines should be publicly accessible

It is authoritative but requires judgment in application.” So military doctrines must be accessible to any citizen without having to ask for it. Read More
