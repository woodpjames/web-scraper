2016
Afghanistan’s Right To Information Law went into effect in December 2014. A country just emerging from nearly 40 years of war has given its citizens access to information on how their government works.
A group of Afghan RTI activists visited Delhi and interacted with the RTI team at the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI) on October 18. India’s RTI law turned 11 just a few days ago on October 12.It was a free exchange of ideas with the Afghan activists. The activists were interested in how RTI laws in India worked and the hurdles RTI advocates in India faced in the years before the law was enacted in 2005 and 11 years since.
Mr Wajahat Habibullah, a former chief information commissioner of India and chairman of CHRI, Ms Anjali Bhardwaj and Ms Amrita Johri both RTI activists from the Satark Nagrik Sangathan, also attended.
