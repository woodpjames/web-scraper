The Central Information Commission (CIC) has directed the army to disclose all proceedings related to the general court martial that was constituted by it in 2013. The court martial was tasked with the trial of the accused in the extra-judicial killing of 3 people in Macchil in Jammu and Kashmir on April 30, 2010. The court martial had later convicted five army personnel for a fake encounter, including a colonel and a captain. The orders of the CIC came on a petition by RTI activist and programme coordinator at the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative, Venkatesh Nayak. In January 2015, he had filed a request for information under the RTI Act, 2005, asking for the details of the court martial proceedings from the army.Press:  The Wire | Indian Express | Financial Express | Deccan Herald | NaiduNia | Rising kashmirThe CHRI trail of inquiry:The CIC's order is in the first attachment, the RTI application and the Central Public Information Officer’s (CPIO's) decision is in the second attachment.
