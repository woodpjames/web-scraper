April 22, 2018
New Delhi,22 April, 2018Remembering the late Justice Rajinder Sachar as a relentless fighter for truth and justice, the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI), described him as a “generous, reflective and courageous heart and mind “.Prominent human rights activist and former Chief Justice of the Delhi and Sikkim high court, Sachar inspired many with his outspokenness on “a range of  rights matters and his concern for minority and disadvantaged groups,” said Sanjoy Hazarika, International Director of CHRI.Among the best known of his public works is perhaps the leadership of a crucial committee to examine the social, economic and educational status of Muslims in India, popularly known as the Sachar Committee report. The findings of the Committee, showed how backward Muslims were, generating a debate on Muslim inequality. But above all, despite his frailty in later years, he unhesitatingly spoke out against abuse, intimidation and State pressure.He began his career as an advocate in 1952, and shortly thereafter began practicing in the Supreme Court. A decade later, he was appointed an additional judge in the Delhi High Court. After being confirmed as permanent, he was appointed Chief Justice in August 1985. He held this position till December 22, 1985. After retiring from service, Sachar demonstrated his commitment to upholding the rights of the downtrodden through his association with the People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL).For details contact:Niyati Singh, Research Officer, CHRIniyati@humanrightsinitiative.org
