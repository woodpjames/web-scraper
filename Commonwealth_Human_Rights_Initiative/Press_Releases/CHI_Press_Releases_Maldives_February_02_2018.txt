Feb 02, 2018New Delhi, IndiaThe Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI) and the South Asia Media Defenders Network (SAMDEN ) welcome the decision by the Maldives’ Supreme Court for the release of all political prisoners. We urge the Government of the Maldives and its security forces to respect the ruling and ensure its enforcement.The Supreme Court’s order for the fair re-trial of all the political prisoners’ is a landmark ruling. The government’s pressure on the court during trials of political prisoners violated the Maldives’ Constitution and international law.We support the strengthening of human rights, democratic institutions, and respect for the rule of law in the Maldives. The latest ruling reaffirms the fundamentals of the separation of powers. We believe this is a step in the direction of bolstering democracy and good governance in the Maldives.Wajahat Habibullah, Chairperson , Executive Committee, Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI)
