Sept 26, 2018New Delhi, IndiaThe peaceful vote for change in the Maldives Presidential elections is an affirmation of ordinary people in democratic processes and in upholding of dignity and rule of law, the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI) said here today.Welcoming the outcome of the ballot which resulted in the victory of the unified Opposition candidate Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, a long-time parliamentarian from the Maldivian Democratic Party, and the defeat of incumbent President Yameen, CHRI commended the citizens of Maldives “for voting in large numbers despite efforts at intimidation, harassment and threats of violence that characterized the environment in the run-up to the elections”.The high voter turnout of nearly 90% is a clear affirmation of the Maldivian people’s commitment to a democratic electoral process and rule of law enshrined in the 2008 Constitution of the Maldives.CHRI urged all stakeholders and institutions to work together to ensure a smooth transition of power following the November 17 inauguration.For further details, please contact:Devyani Srivastavadevyani@humanrightsinitiative.org  PH: +919810447881
