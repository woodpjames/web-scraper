Mr. Habibullah who served as the first Chief Information Commissioner in India and guided the implementation of India's RTI Bill from 2005-2010 said, "The reason why the RTI Act continues to be one of the most popular laws in India is because citizens, civil society groups, academics and the media were closely involved in the crafting of this law..."
