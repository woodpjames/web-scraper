New DelhiMarch 24, 2017The Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative’s (CHRI) inaugural film festival, “Matter of Rights(s)” opened at the University of Delhi today with eminent filmmaker Mike Pandey’s critically acclaimed film, “Not My Life”.The film documents human trafficking across 13 countries including Brazil, Cambodia, Ghana and India, and focuses on multiple forms of modern slavery, such as forced labour and sex trafficking.“Trafficking is a huge issue globally, and is a $120 billion industry. The film seeks to stir people into thinking what we as human beings are doing to each other. It hurts me to see that as thinking human beings we allow such travesties to happen. Instead of being self-consumed, we should think about those around us,” said Pandey, reflecting on the issues raised in the film.The festival is being held at the Arts Faculty, University of Delhi on March 24-25, and at the FTK-CIT Conference Hall, Jamia Millia Islamia on March 27. Exploring issues of marginalization, police excesses and injustice through the lens of cinema, the festival will feature nearly a dozen documentaries from India and abroad, including ‘Candles in the Wind’ by Kavita Bahl and Nandan Saxena, ‘Le Cas Pinochet’ (The Pinochet Case) by P Guzman, ‘What the Fields Remember’ by Subasri Krishnan, ‘Rambuai’ by Sanjoy Hazarika and Preeti Gill, and ‘Diamantes Negros’ (Black Diamonds) by Miguel Alcantud.CHRI is hosting this initiative in collaboration with the Centre for Violence, Memory and Trauma (CSVMT), University of Delhi, and Department of English and Centre for North East Studies and Policy Research, Jamia Millia Islamia.New Delhi/March 24, 2017: The Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative’s (CHRI) inaugural film festival, “Matter of Rights(s)” opened at the University of Delhi today with eminent filmmaker Mike Pandey’s critically acclaimed film, “Not My Life”.The film documents human trafficking across 13 countries including Brazil, Cambodia, Ghana and India, and focuses on multiple forms of modern slavery, such as forced labour and sex trafficking.“Trafficking is a huge issue globally, and is a $120 billion industry.
