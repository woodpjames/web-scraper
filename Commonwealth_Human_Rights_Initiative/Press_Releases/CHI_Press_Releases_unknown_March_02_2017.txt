Anam observed that media pressure was not new, but a worrying current development was the public's lack of faith in them, partly due to journalists allowing themselves to become politicised. Rita Payne agreed with Mahfuz Anam commenting that it is 'troubling that the media is being used to turn on itself.'Speaking last, David Page struck a positive note on recent improvements in Sri Lanka, but in general the panel were in agreement that the situation in the region was deteriorating.The event closed with a discussion with the audience, including on the effects of what was described as the 'tsunami of social media', and the two hour session closed with a warning from Hazarika that terrible things can happen 'on the coattails of populism.'
