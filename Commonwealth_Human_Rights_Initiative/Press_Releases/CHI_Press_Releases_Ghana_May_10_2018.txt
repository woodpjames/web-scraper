May 8, 2018AccraExpressing solidarity with local media organizations about the reported assault on Ghanaian journalist Ohemaa Sekyiwa by Hajia Fati, a member of the ruling New Patriotic Party in Ghana, the South Asia Media Defenders Network (SAMDEN) has also called for an independent investigation into the incident.
In a statement, the Media Defenders Network, which is based in South Asia and anchored in the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI), noted today that “the incident took place within a day of the close of the two-day international Press Freedom Day in Accra”.
CHRI is headquartered in New Delhi and has offices in Accra and London. SAMDEN is building connections with media organizations across the Commonwealth, the organization of 53 former British colonies.
Sanjoy Hazarika, the founder of SAMDEN and international director of CHRI, expressed solidarity with media organizations which have rallied around the issue. He pointed out that Ghanaian government leaders, including the President and Information Minister, who had addressed the Press Freedom conference had consistently spoken of the country’s track record as a democracy. “Respect for a free media undergirds democratic practices and spans boundaries,” he added.Issued by
