October 17, 2017New Delhi, IndiaThe murder of Maltese investigative journalist and intrepid blogger Daphne Caruana Galizia points to the dangers of investigative journalism worldwide, a group of international editors and journalists said today.Daphne Galizia’s killing on Monday comes at a time of a clear increase in violence and intimidation, aimed at journalists and media.   The trends show shrinking space for freedom of expression amidst concerns about a climate of increased intolerance even in ‘democratic’ nations. Galizia was well-known for her fearless investigations into the Panama Papers, an issue which has embroiled many entities and individuals in South Asia and beyond.
 
“Indeed, the news is relentlessly gloomy - week after week brings news of journalists abducted, jailed, prosecuted and killed,” said the South Asia Media Defenders Network (SAMDEN), an association of professional journalists, editors and bloggers. “The latest incident casts a pall on the right of journalists to do their professional work without fear or favour,” said SAMDEN, urging the Government of Malta to energetically and urgently investigate the case so that the killers are identified, caught and prosecuted.
 
The latest killing took place after the murder of twojournalists, Gauri Lankesh and Shantanu Bhowmick in separate incidents in September in India, said the association, pointing out the widespread incidence of such anti-media violence.
