September 21, 2017
New DelhiSep 21 2017The South Asia Media Defenders Network (SAMDEN) condemns the killing of journalist Shantanu Bhowmik, in Mandai in Tripura, saying that the issue goes beyond media freedom and involves the right to life. Bhowmik, a reporter for a local television news channel, Raat Din TV, was killed while covering a political rally of the Indigenous People's Front of Tripura (PFT) on Wednesday.He had been reporting on the PFT agitation when, according to the Press Trust of India, quoting the local Superintendent of Police, the 28 year-old was abducted and killed.Coming as it does only days after the murder of journalist Gauri Lankesh in Bengaluru, this is a reminder of the increasing violence being directed towards mediapersons across India. Reporters on the field in far-flung areas are particularly vulnerable to such attacks and intimidation.As media professionals, we call upon political parties across the spectrum to ensure that the protection of journalists and on the Tripura Government to ensure justice to Bhowmick's family and that the attackers are brought to book to face the full force of the law.The incident goes beyond freedom of expression. It is becoming one of the right to life and liberty, the most fundamental of all rights.Sanjoy Hazarika, Director, Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI), columnist and authorMrinal Pande, Writer and Editor, New DelhiTarun Basu, Director and former Chief Editor, IANS and President, Society for Policy Studies (SPS)Nidhi Razdan, Executive Editor, NDTVJayanta Bhattacharya, Bureau Chief, PTI, Agartala, TripuraSir Mark Tully, Journalist and BroadcasterGillian Wright, independent journalist and authorMahendra Ved, President, Commonwealth Journalists Association, Columnist ,The New Straits Times, MalaysiaJohn Zubrzycki, writer, former Deputy Foreign Editor, The Australian newspaper, SydneySalil Tripathi, columnist, author, Chair of the Writers in Prison Committee of PEN International, LondonRita Payne, journalist and Media Adviser, President Emeritus, Commonwealth Journalists AssociationPradip Phanjoubam, Editor, Imphal Free PressSandeep Phukan, Deputy Editor, The HinduKaran Thapar, journalist and a television commentator and interviewerS.
