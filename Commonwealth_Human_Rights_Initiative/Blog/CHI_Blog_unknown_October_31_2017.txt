The CIC treated NHPC- the Respondent in my second appeal matter, as a 'third party' as well and held that information about the negotiations would fall under the category of "commercial confidence" under Section 8(1)(d) of The Right to Information Act, 2005 (RTI Act).Ordinarily, while disseminating information about my RTI interventions, I only circulate the CIC's order along with the relevant RTI documents without commenting on the decision, out of respect to the wisdom of the CIC.

The NHPC has asserted before the CIC that the negotiations are still going on, in support of their claim to Section 8(1)(d) of the RTI Act.
