MSF publishes study on treatment of Chagas in Honduras, Guatemala and BoliviaMillions of people are infected with Chagas disease and do not know it. They can die in silence, without asking for help, without knowing why. It´s time to act: diagnose and treat now!This year, 2009, marks the centenary of the discovery by the Brazilian doctor Carlos Chagas of the disease which bears his name. In 1909, Dr. Chagas announced to the world the existence of a new infectious disease. The previous year, he had discovered the parasite which causes it and the vector by which it is transmitted. His triple discovery is considered unique in the history of medicine.One hundred years after this discovery, however:Historically, Chagas disease programs have focused on prevention of the disease and on vector control. Now, knowing that the majority of those infected by the parasite can be treated, this focus, which has excluded treatment, is no longer acceptable. In its 10 years of experience in the field, MSF has proved that the diagnosis and treatment of Chagas disease, even in
remote rural environments, is viable, necessary and ethically beyond question.The MSF report, "Chagas: It's Time to Break the Silence," explains the main issues driving MSF to speak out on this disease, including:MSF is calling on the governments of endemic countries to fight on all fronts against Chagas disease.
