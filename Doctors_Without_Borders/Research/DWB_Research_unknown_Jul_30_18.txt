Invisible war: Central America’s forgotten humanitarian crisis

Jul 30 18
Jason Cone, executive director of Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) in the United States, and Marc Bosch Bonacasa, head of operations for Latin America for MSF-Spain, write about the threats facing people forced to flee extreme violence in Central America. The evidence gathered by MSF through our medical clinics along the migration route in Mexico illustrates a humanitarian crisis that demands increased levels of aid and compassion. Instead, misguided policies by the United States and Mexico are increasing the dangers for vulnerable people. This is an excerpt of an essay published by the Brown Journal of World Affairs.A Salvadoran father of four was told by gang members that they would kill his two daughters after he refused their extortion demands. A 27-year-old lesbian from Honduras was gang raped in her home, ostracized by her family, forced to leave behind her child born of rape, and later hunted by gangs because of her sexual orientation. An unaccompanied 16-year-old Honduran boy fled forced gang conscription, was raped along the road in Mexico, and is now battling sexually transmitted infections.These are just a few of the individuals who have sought shelter at La 72, an albergue, or hostel, in the small town of Tenosique, Mexico, 40 miles north of the Guatemalan border. It sits on the front line of a burgeoning forced displacement crisis with 500,000 people fleeing annually from countries of the Northern Triangle of Central America (NTCA)—El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.
