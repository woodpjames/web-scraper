[2.49 MB]The Urban Survivors web-documentary—at www.urbansurvivors.org—takes the visitor on a virtual journey through five slums—in Dhaka, Bangladesh; Karachi,  Pakistan; Johannesburg, South Africa; Port-au-Prince, Haiti; and Nairobi, Kenya—where MSF is actively running projects.Featuring the work of award-winning NOOR photographers, Urban Survivors lets the visitor discover more about the daily lives of people in these slums, the humanitarian issues they face, and what MSF is doing to address these problems.Introduction:In 2009, humanity crossed a profound threshold. For the first time, more than half of the world’s population lived in cities rather than in rural areas. Many people made the move seeking greater economic opportunity, but rapid and sustained urbanization has swelled existing slums, and spurred the creation of new ones in countries around the world.
