Annual Report 2005

Feb 9 14
With your generous support, the US section of Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) was able to increase our funding for field programs by more than 48 percent in 2005. This allowed MSF teams, which included a record 208 aid workers from the United States, to provide vital medical care to people affected by conflicts and crises often ignored by political leaders and the media.
