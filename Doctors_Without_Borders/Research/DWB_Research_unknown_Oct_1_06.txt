HIV renders tuberculosis more difficult to diagnose (due to higher incidence of sputum negative disease), and treat (due to interactions and side-effects). The increasing spread of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and the recalcitrant nature of persistent infections pose additional challenges to treatment with currently available anti-TB drugs.

Resistance to at least two main first line drugs and additionally to three or more of the six classes of second-line drugs makes this form of TB virtually untreatable with available drugs.Read more
