Annual Report 2001

Feb 9 14
This year’s Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) Annual Report is dedicated to the selfless and unfailing work of our medical and non-medical volunteers. The volunteer spirit upon which MSF was founded 30 years ago continues to infuse the relief work the organization performs around the world, as well as its public education and advocacy efforts here in the United States.
