Annual Report 2000

Feb 9 14
It is with great pleasure that we present to you the 2000 Annual Report of the US office of Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF). This annual report is devoted to advocacy—speaking out and raising awareness—and the many ways in which MSF uses its presence and voice to shed light on injustices and abuses observed by volunteers in the course of their work.
