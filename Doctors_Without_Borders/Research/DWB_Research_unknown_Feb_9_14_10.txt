Annual Report 2009

Feb 9 14
msf works in more than 60 countries across the globe, and in each, our job is to use the resources you have so generously entrusted us with—$133.9 million in 2009 alone—to establish structures in which patients can receive the care they need regardless of their race, religion, ethnicity, or affiliation. In 2009 we responded to numerous crises—conflicts, natural disasters, pandemics, and more—while advocating that humanitarian space be respected and that greater attention be paid to places and diseases too frequently neglected.
