Download Report [2.79 MB]This is the 14th edition of Untangling the Web of Antiretroviral Price Reductions (UTW), released at the International AIDS Society (IAS) Conference 2011 in Rome. It demonstrates a growing and deadly divide in antiretroviral (ARV) prices offered to the poorest countries versus lower and middle-income countries that are still grappling with the scale-up of lifesaving HIV treatment.UTW includes information on the evolution in price for each ARV over time, charting the difference between the originator price and the lowest price available from generic producers for developing countries. UTW also highlights access issues for each drug, outlining patent restrictions, pricing differentials (tiered prices) for middle-income countries and the status of pediatric formulations. The 14th edition of UTW additionally covers issues that have emerged in access to ARV and the associated problems with development of pediatric formulations and scale-up using newer drugs.Download the updated report and previous versions of UTW here.Read more about the IAS Conference 2011 here.
