Annual Report 2004

Feb 9 14
Whether treating a severely malnourished child in Sudan, or a woman ﬁghting tuberculosis in Cambodia, the actions of Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) are driven by a sense of responsibility towards people struggling to survive amidst forgotten or neglected conﬂicts, natural disasters, and epidemics around the world. MSF is able to respond to the needs of people caught in crisis, in large part, because of donations from you and other US supporters, who donated an unprecedented $91.4 million to MSF-USA in 2004.
