Annual Report 2008

Feb 9 14
Your generosity to Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) during the 2008 economic downturn permitted us to continue our independent response to an extraordinary range and magnitude of emergencies. MSF-USA was able to commit more than $133 million to fund emergency medical programs in 2008— testament to the determination of supporters across the country to bring assistance and care to the most vulnerable people caught in crises in more than 60 countries.
