Out of Step 2015: TB Policies in 24 Countries

Dec 2 15
The 2015 Out of Step report presents the results of a survey of 24 countries conducted by Stop TB Partnership and MSF. Building on the first edition of Out of Step published in 2014, this year’s survey tracked of the latest tuberculosis policies, guidelines, and tools across five areas: diagnosis and drug resistance testing; drug-sensitive TB (DS-TB) treatment regimens; MDR-TB treatment regimens; models of care; and regulatory frameworks. The results of this survey provide a snapshot of the world’s readiness to defeat the TB epidemic. Although effectively implemented policies and guidelines alone will not be sufficient, they form the foundation for a strong and comprehensive TB response that leaves no one with TB behind.
