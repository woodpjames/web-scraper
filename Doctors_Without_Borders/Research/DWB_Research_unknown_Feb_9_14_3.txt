Annual Report 2002

Feb 9 14
It is with great pleasure that we present the 2002 Annual Report describing the activities of the US section of Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF). None of the year’s accomplishments would have been possible without the strong support of our donors. With your help, MSF volunteers provided urgent medical care to victims of conflict and disaster in more than 80 countries in 2002.
