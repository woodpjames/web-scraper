Jun 9 16
Join MSF for a preview and discussion of Fire In The Blood and current U.S. government trade and global health policies with expert panelists as they examine this history and explain how the battle for affordable medicines and equal access for all patients continues today.The effort to provide the best available treatments for diseases throughout the world has frequently been hampered by various industry and government obstacles like patent laws and trade agreements that drive up prices for medications and protocols. Never was this more clear than in the late 1990s and early 2000s when millions of people infected with HIV in Africa and other developing areas were denied access to drugs benefitting patients in the West. The production and availability of generic versions of these medications revolutionized the nature of HIV/AIDS treatment and made it possible to treat millions of people. The new award winning documentary, Fire in the Blood, provides an in-depth look at the history of that great breakthrough.Join us for a short preview and discussion of Fire In The Blood and current U.S. government trade and global health policies, with expert panelists, including the filmâ€™s director, as they examine this history and explain how the battle for affordable medicines and equal access for all patients continues today, through, for example, the proposed provisions in the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP) which threaten to restrict access to generic competition.Panelists:Els Torreele, Director, Access to Essential Medicines Initiative, Open Society Foundations James Love, Director, Knowledge Ecology International Dylan Mohan Gray, Director/Producer/Writer/Editor, Fire in the Blood Sharonann Lynch, HIV/AIDS Policy Advisor, Doctors Without BordersThis webcast was originally broadcast on September 5, 2013.
