In early 2014, MSF’s hospital in Leer, in South Sudan’s Unity State, was attacked, burned and looted. On May 9, staff and patients were evacuated again in anticipation of another devastating attack.The hospital has served the population of Leer and its surrounding area for 27 years, providing treatment for HIV, tuberculosis, and kala azar (visceral leishmaniasis), malnutrition, and more.The following are photos of MSF’s hospital in Leer when it was active and images of it after it was destroyed in early 2014. MSF calls on all groups to respect our patients, staff and health care facilities.
