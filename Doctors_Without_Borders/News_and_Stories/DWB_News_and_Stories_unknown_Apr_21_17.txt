What Constitutes a Famine? 

Apr 21 17
The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has suffered near back-to-back emergencies for decades. Political instability and violence have forced millions of people from their homes. Humanitarian crises and epidemics have followed, worsened by the lack of available health care and reliable infrastructure.Operating on the basis of need alone, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) provides more emergency medical care in Democratic Republic of Congo than in any other country in the world. Year after year, as conditions on the ground have evolved, MSF doctors, nurses, and midwives adapt to the needs of their patients in order to alleviate as much suffering they can.But there is only so much that MSF can do. For every child cured of malaria, every mother helped to safely deliver a healthy baby, every rape survivor cared for, and every victim of violence treated, there are many more people living in DRC who get no medical care whatsoever. Every day, we witness the suffering of our patients as a result of conflict, the absence of a functioning public health system, and a lack of adequate humanitarian assistance.Find out more about MSF's work in DRC here.
