Trauma Care in Iraq: "Every Day We See the Worst Injuries Inflicted by This War" 

Apr 3 17
The past year was marked by an unprecedented Ebola outbreak in West Africa, but crises elsewhere also pushed our medical teams to the limit. Thanks to your generosity, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) were able to respond. While you are watching this, our teams are saving lives in a crisis somewhere. On behalf of our patients and staff: Thank you.
