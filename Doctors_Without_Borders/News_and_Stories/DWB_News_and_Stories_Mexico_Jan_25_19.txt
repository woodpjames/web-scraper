Jan 25 19
Half a million people cross into Mexico each year from Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras, the so-called Northern Triangle of Central America, one of the most violent regions in the world.Doctors Without Borders/Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) has been working in shelters along the route north since 2012, providing basic medical and mental health care to people who have crossed into Mexico.Our teams have documented numerous stories of violent displacement, persecution, sexual violence, and forced repatriation. This scale of violence is close to what you might see in a war zone.
