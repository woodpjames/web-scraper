Trauma in Gaza: “Nothing can prepare you for this”

Nov 29 18
One year since more than 700,000 Rohingya refugees were forced to flee from Myanmar to Bangladesh, the denial of their legal status coupled with unacceptable living conditions in makeshift camps trap refugees in a cycle of suffering.On August 25, 2017, the Myanmar Army launched renewed ”clearance operations” ostensibly aimed at Rohingya militants but targeting all members of the community, including women and children. Widespread attacks against the Muslim minority group forced more than 706,000 people to flee to neighboring Bangladesh. They joined some 200,000 ethnic Rohingya displaced by previous waves of violence, bringing the total number of Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh to more than 919,000.
