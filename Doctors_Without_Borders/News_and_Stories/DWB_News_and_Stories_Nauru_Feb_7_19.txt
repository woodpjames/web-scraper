MSF launches remote mental health care service for patients on Nauru

Feb 7 19
In late 2018, Ella Baron, a cartoonist on assignment with The Guardian, visited a Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) clinic in Shatila refugee camp in Lebanon. She listened to stories from our patients—mostly Syrian women—and from MSF staff. Her vivid illustrations provide a glimpse into the lives of people living in Shatila, and the range of mental health care needs there. Alongside these pictures, MSF psychologist Miriam Slikhanian shares her personal experiences of working with refugees in the camp.
