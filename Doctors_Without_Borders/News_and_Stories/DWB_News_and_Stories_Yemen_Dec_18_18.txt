PBS NewsHour: Critical Yemeni port city clings to fragile truce

Dec 18 18
The United States government is increasingly turning its back on refugees and asylum-seekers. In this video, Jason Cone, executive director for Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) in the US, talks about the devastating impact of “zero tolerance” policies on vulnerable people forced to flee extreme violence and poverty. The administration is treating Central Americans seeking safety as if they are criminals. MSF runs projects in El Salvador, Honduras, and along the migration route in Mexico and sees firsthand the threats facing our patients. We are urging the US government to uphold the right to asylum and stop sending people back into danger. Seeking safety is not a crime.
