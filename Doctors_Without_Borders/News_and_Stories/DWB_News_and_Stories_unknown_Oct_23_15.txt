Oct 23 15
As cholera continues to affect the people of Haiti MSF teams are working to open additional treatment centers. In the northern-most part of Haiti, the Port-de-Paix region, MSF has opened a large treatment center and a small treatment unit to increase access to treatment. In the treatment unit, a small team of three, two international staff and a Haitian nurse, have been able to offer treatment to people unable to travel to the larger treatment facilities.
