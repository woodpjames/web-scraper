Officially, an unaccompanied minor is a foreign child under 18 who not in the care of a responsible adult; a father, mother, or close relative. Nearly 34,000 unaccompanied minors arrived in Europe in 2016, most from Eritrea, Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Gambia. In France, child welfare services have a legal obligation to protect these children. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is helping to fill some of the large gaps in the system.
