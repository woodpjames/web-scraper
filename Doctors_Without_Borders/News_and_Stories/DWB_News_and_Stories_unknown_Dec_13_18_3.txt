This video is based on the true story of Pedro*, a Honduran man who fled gang violence and received care from Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) at a shelter in Tenosique, Mexico. Pedro still had bullets in his body from an attack by gang members. He and his family were trying to escape extreme violence but encountered many more hardships on the journey north to find safety. The video features illustrations by artist Edel Rodriguez.*Name changed to protect anonymity.
