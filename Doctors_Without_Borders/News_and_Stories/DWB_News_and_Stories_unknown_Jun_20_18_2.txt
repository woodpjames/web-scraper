Video: We are Rohingya

Jun 20 18
More than 32,000 people who fled the Kasaï region in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) have settled in a series of camps in Cacanda, Mussungue, and Dundo in northern Angola. In April, refugees started arriving at the temporary camps, where Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has established two clinics and carried out more than 15,000 consultations in the last four months. Teams carry out obstetrics and neonatal health programs, operate outpatient malnutrition programs, provide mental health services and sexual violence counseling, and refer patients to hospital facilities. MSF has also started collaborating with the pediatric hospital of Chitato, which focuses on caring for acutely malnourished children among both refugees and the local community. In addition, MSF teams will soon provide medical care to refugees at a clinic in the new Lovua camp, located over 60 miles from Dundo.
