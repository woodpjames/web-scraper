Doctors Without Borders Welcomes Pfizer's Pneumonia Vaccine Price Reduction for Children in Humanitarian Emergencies

Nov 16 16
Chagas is a neglected disease that affects between eight and ten million people, mainly in Latin America. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) works in Paraguay's rural Chaco region, going into isolated communities to educate people about the disease and screen them for it. Internationally, MSF fights to improve access to diagnosis and treatment for the disease and advocates for more research and development into its treatment.All photos by Anna Surinyach
