DRC: MSF Assists Victims of Violence in South Kivu 

Mar 30 16
The town of Léogâne lies about 18 miles (30 km) from Port-au-Prince; much of it was destroyed during the 2010 earthquake. Survivors of the quake have found housing for the most part, but the Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) hospital is still the only facility in the region that offers free medical care and 24-hour emergency treatment. Well before January 2010, most Haitians did not have access to free, quality medical care due to lack of money or available services. Despite the the vast amounts of international aid pledged after the quake, little progress has been made in health services, so MSF continues to try to fill this gap three years later.
