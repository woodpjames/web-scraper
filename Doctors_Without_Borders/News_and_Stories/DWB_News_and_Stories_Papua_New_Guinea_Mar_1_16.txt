In August 2011, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) opened a 70-bed emergency trauma center in Kunduz, a city of 250,000 people in the north of Afghanistan. It's the only hospital of its kind in the region, and, like all MSF hospitals, no guns are allowed, and treatment is free. Patients arrive here every day, and with a variety of injuries.
