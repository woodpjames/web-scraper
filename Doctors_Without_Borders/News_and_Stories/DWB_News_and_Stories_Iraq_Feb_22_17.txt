Displaced in Iraq: "Those in Front of Me Have Made It. They are Alive."

Feb 22 17
As the fighting continues to rage in Iraq, 1.8 million people have been forced to flee from their homes. Humanitarian aid efforts are insufficient and come nowhere near to covering people’s most basic needs. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) sees two kinds of displaced people: those who have managed to escape to a region of Kurdistan unaffected by the fighting, and those trapped in dangerous areas like the provinces of Anbar and Kirkuk.
