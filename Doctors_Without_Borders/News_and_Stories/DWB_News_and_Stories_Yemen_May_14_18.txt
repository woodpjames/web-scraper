North Yemen: Living under the daily barrage of airstrikes 

May 14 18
Violence has spread into parts of southern Central African Republic, and communities that were relatively calm until March 2017 are now caught in the crossfire. Villages have been burned and people have been attacked and displaced. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) works in several areas, including Bambari, where communities are cut off from medical care and people have fled their homes and livelihoods.
