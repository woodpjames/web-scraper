MSF Calls for Medical Evacuation of Syrian War-Wounded into Northern Jordan

Jul 20 16
Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) opened a clinic inside this camp sheltering 12,400 Syrian refugees in northern Iraq in September. MSF teams provided nearly 4,000 consultations in October, a third of them for children. As winter sets in MSF is even more concerned about the refugees' health.
