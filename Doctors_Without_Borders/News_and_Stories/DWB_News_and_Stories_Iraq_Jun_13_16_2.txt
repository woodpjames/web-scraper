And this past year, she partnered with Mother Denim to design a pair of faux-leather jeans that will be sold in the US, the UK, and Japan, with a percentage of the proceeds going to MSF.“I find it very gratifying when I can combine my passion for MSF and the work the organization does with my personal and professional lives,” she says. “These are people who go out and save lives all over the world. I’m thrilled to be a donor, and I’ll keep looking for more ways to help.”
