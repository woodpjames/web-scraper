Telemedicine on the Front Lines 

May 31 17
Located in West Africa, Guinea-Bissau is at the bottom of the world development index. The country ranks 188th of 198 countries in the United Nations 2014 Human Development Report, and has an infant mortality rate of 116 per 1,000 children, which puts Guinea-Bissau among the 10 countries with the worst maternal and child health indicators in the world. In November 2014, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) launched a pediatric project in the region of Bafatá in central Guinea-Bissau to provide affordable and effective health care for children. By working with mothers, ensuring that necessary medical equipment is available, and training 200 members of the community, MSF and Medical Coordinator Isabel Grovas hope to improve health conditions for mothers and children.
