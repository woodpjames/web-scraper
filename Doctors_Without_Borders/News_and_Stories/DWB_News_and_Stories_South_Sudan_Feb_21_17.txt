South Sudan: Providing Care to People on the Move

Feb 21 17
Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) treats wounded patients from Iraq, Syria, and Yemen in its hospital in Amman, Jordan. Since the project began eight years ago, doctors have been treating people suffering from infections that are resistant to one or several antibiotics. Today, half of all patients arriving at the hospital already have multi-drug resistant bacteria, and it is posing a serious threat to public health in the region.
