Refugees who have made it out of Syria are pouring into camps in neighboring countries, and international aid is not keeping up. In one camp in Lebanon families must wait weeks or months to be registered, meanwhile having to share tents with other families outside the camp and receiving no food aid. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is treating people suffering from illnesses often related to the living conditions.
