Musical “animators” at MSF’s Drouillard Hospital in Port-au-Prince can play a key role in getting traumatized patients to open up and talk to counselors. MSF psychologists say that patients are often suffering from “accumulated trauma” - the trauma that brings them into the hospital is only the latest in a series of losses and injuries stemming from the earthquake, the ongoing cholera epidemic, and the violence that has long haunted the country. This makes mental health care extremely important; MSF offers group therapy and one-on-one counseling at Drouillard Hospital.This is one of three videos in an MSF Insight video package on the lasting effects of the 2010 earthquake in Haiti.
