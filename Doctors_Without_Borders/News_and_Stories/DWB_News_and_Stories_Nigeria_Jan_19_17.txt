TIME: ‘There Are No Words to Describe the Chaos’: Eyewitness Account of Bombing on Nigeria Refugee Camp

Jan 19 17
Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is scaling up Ebola operations as the outbreak in West Africa continues to spread and a new outbreak in Democratic Republic of Congo has begun. The international response to the outbreak is still inadequate and MSF is overwhelmed by the needs. For example, in its first week, MSF’s new Ebola management center in Liberia’s capital Monrovia, was already at capacity with 120 patients, and an expansion is underway. To try to meet the needs, MSF is also training its own staff, as well as staff working with other non-governmental organizations, in Europe before they fly out to various projects.
