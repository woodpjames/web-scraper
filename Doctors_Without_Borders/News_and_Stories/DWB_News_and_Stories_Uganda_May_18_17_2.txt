South Sudanese Refugees in Uganda: "We Left With Nothing"

May 18 17
Thousands of people fleeing violence, insecurity, and privation at home attempt a treacherous journey through North Africa and across the Mediterranean Sea to Europe every year. Countless lives are lost during the passage. So far this year, more than 1,500 people have been left to drown. In response to the urgent need for maritime search-and-rescue activities, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has partnered with the Migrant Offshore Aid Station (MOAS) to provide assistance to people fleeing crises and risking their lives to reach safe haven in Europe.
