CAR: High Humanitarian Needs, Low International Attention

Nov 4 16
Nearly every hour, one woman in Pakistan dies from complications during birth. In Balochistan, the rate is even higher than the rest of the country. A third of women marry before the age of 15, and two-thirds of them are illiterate. This, along with poverty and the distance from clinics, contributes to the high maternal mortality rate, leaving women to make important prenatal decisions without the power to do so. Only three out of ten pregnant women deliver their babies with skilled health workers there to help them. Doctors Without Borders/ Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is in Balochistan providing comprehensive emergency obstetric care, neonatal nursery, pediatric, and gynecological inpatient care, emergency referrals, and nutrition services to combat the issue.
