Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has treated more than 300 babies for malnutrition in Qayyara, Iraq, since March, most of them under 6 months old. Many of these sick infants arrived with families fleeing the besieged part of western Mosul. Their mothers have often been unable to breastfeed due to the trauma and living conditions they've endured, and in western Mosul there is little access to formula or health care.
