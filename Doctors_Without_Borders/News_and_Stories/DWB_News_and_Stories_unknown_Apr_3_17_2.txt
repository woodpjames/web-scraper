When Antibiotics Stop Working

According to the World Health Organization, 21,000 women died last year in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) due to complications during pregnancy and childbirth: that’s one death every 25 minutes. More than 100,000 newborns (almost five percent of the country’s total) die at birth or just after. MSF works in South Kivu province, eastern DRC, to connect women with skilled care before, during, and after childbirth.
