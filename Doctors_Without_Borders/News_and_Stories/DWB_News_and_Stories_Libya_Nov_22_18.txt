A year ago, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) opened the Baghdad Medical Rehabilitation Center (BMRC) to support victims of war in Iraq. The center provides much needed post-surgical rehabilitation care, including physical and psychological support.Mohammed Hussein, 27, can’t carry his newborn baby in his arms yet. Last year, fighters from the Islamic State group ambushed his car near the border between Iraq and Jordan. Both his legs were fractured and he suffered a severe nerve injury in one of them.“I was lucky because I still have one good leg left,” he said. Four of his friends died in the attack. Mohammed managed to escape and hide. “They burned our car. I activated my phone’s GPS and recorded a voice message for my family. I thought I was going to die.”For more than a year, Mohammed has been going in and out of hospitals across Iraq. Two major surgeries later, he is receiving post-surgical rehabilitation care at the BMRC.
