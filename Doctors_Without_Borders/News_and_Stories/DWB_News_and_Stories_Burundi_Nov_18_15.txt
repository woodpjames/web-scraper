An innovative partnership between MSF and the Zip Zap Circus school in South Africa helped children from Khayelitsha township and Cape Town who are living with HIV take the stage and soar on World Aids Day.Last December, on World AIDS Day, children from Khayelitsha township and Cape Town who have been receiving pediatric HIV treatment from MSF showed what they had learned in a complementary social program run by the Zip Zap Circus School, which is supported by Cirque du Soleil. While MSF manages medical care for the children, Zip Zap's training programs focuses on skills training, team building, and self-confidence enhancement through acrobatics and performance. And, as this footage from the Zip Zap Circus in Cape Town and the O.R. Tambo Community Centre in Khayelitsha shows, they have taken to heart the lesson that they can be stars.
