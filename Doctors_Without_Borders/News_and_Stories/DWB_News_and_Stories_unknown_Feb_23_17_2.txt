Much-Needed Care for Sexual Violence Survivors in Nairobi

Soon there will be 700 beds for treating Ebola patients in Monrovia. But medical staff are among the first victims, and in the Liberian capital, half of the health centers are shut and just one hospital is functioning. Many of the city’s inhabitants—pregnant women, children suffering from malnutrition or malaria, and road casualties—are without access to medical care. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is concerned with protecting health workers providing all kinds of medical care.
