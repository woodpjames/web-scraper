Doctors Without Borders to Open Educational, Outdoor Exhibit on Refugee Crisis in Boston

Oct 12 16
Over a year has passed since the March 2013 coup d'etat by mostly Muslim fighters, called the Seleka, plunged Central African Republic into conflict. Christian armed groups soon formed, initially as a defense, called the anti-Balaka. Fighting between the armed groups has since raged, with civilians across CAR caught in the deadly crossfire. Two Doctors Without Borders/Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) doctors describe working there today.
