Yemen: Land mines take heavy toll on civilians 

Jan 9 19
Since the war in Yemen escalated in March 2015, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has significantly expanded activities there. We have treated some 110,000 patients for cholera, delivered nearly 60,000 babies, and provided medical care to over 800,000 emergency room patients. This timeline shows how years of conflict have decimated the public health system and created a massive humanitarian crisis.
