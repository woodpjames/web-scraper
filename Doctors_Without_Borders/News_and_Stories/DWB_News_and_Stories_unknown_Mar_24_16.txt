Mar 24 16
The town of Burco (also written as 'Burao'), in Somaliland, has the largest public hospital in the area and serves at least 350,000 people.Last year, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) medical teams joined Ministry of Health staff at this eight-ward hospital to start providing high-quality, free medical services. Now, Somali staff work alongside MSF staff from as far away as China and Denmark so that patients with medical emergencies receive quality health care.The hospital's emergency room is the point of entry for many patients. More than 4,500 people were seen there during the first nine months of 2012. This first video in a series of three looks at the emergency room.
