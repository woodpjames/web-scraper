Although tuberculosis (TB) is preventable and curable, it is the second-biggest infectious disease killer behind HIV and claims nearly 1.3 million lives each year.The spread of drug-resistant strains of the disease is increasingly recognized as a public health emergency. Drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) is an umbrella term that refers to tuberculosis strains which resist the drugs routinely used to treat conventional TB.The term DR-TB includes multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), where the patient is resistant to two of the most effective tuberculosis medicines, and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB), which is even harder to cure.This photo gallery offers a glimpse into the world of DR-TB patients and staff at an MSF clinic in Mumbai, India. Treatment is long, complex, and painful, with severe side effects.At the 2014 World Health Assembly in Geneva, Switzerland, former XDR-TB patient Phumeza Tisile of South Africa is calling attention to MSF’s demands for progress against this epidemic. She will deliver the 'Test Me, Treat Me' DR-TB Manifesto and its call to action—supported by tens of thousands of patients, medical practitioners, and advocates—directly to delegates as they discuss the next 20-year global plan to control tuberculosis.For more information, visit the “Test Me, Treat Me” DR-TB Manifesto campaign website: https://www.msfaccess.org/TBmanifesto/*Patients’ names have been changed to protect their privacy.
