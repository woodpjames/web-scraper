Haiti: Assessing Medical Needs in the Wake of Hurricane Matthew

Oct 8 16
As war rages on, 90,000 South Sudanese people have fled their country and taken refuge in camps in the Gambella region of Ethiopia. The conditions in these camps are dire, and are set to get worse as the rainy season sets in. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) works in three camps providing medical consultations, inpatient care and vaccinating children as they arrive. But the teams see that the priority has to be improving living conditions to prevent the refugees' state of health deteriorating still further.
