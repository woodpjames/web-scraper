Jul 28 17
Watch A Month in Focus, a monthly video series that reports on some of Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) current field activities. This month we look at: people on the migration route to Europe, an intervention in Mali, a hospital in Jordan for those caught in regional conflicts, MSF's work in Afghanistan, the evolution of MSF's logistics centers, and the situation for South Sudanese refugees in Ethiopia.
