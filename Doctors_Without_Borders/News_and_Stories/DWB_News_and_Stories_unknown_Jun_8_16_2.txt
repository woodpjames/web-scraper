Doctors Without Borders Remarks on Launch of O’Neill Report on Antimicrobial Resistance

Jun 8 16
In order to prevent the diseases that killed many refugees in Yida camp, South Sudan, in 2012, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has launched a water and sanitation program and begun a vaccination campaign for children. The campaign was pushed back to start now, during the logistically difficult rainy season, because MSF had to engage in lengthy negotiations to get the vaccine at an affordable price.
