Zimbabwe: “If I Don’t Help Mentally Ill Patients, Who Will?"

Feb 16 17
In the Cauca mountains in Colombia, most of the population lives in rural communities that are affected by the conflict between the armed groups and the government forces which has plagued the area for the past 50 years.

	Despite a decrease in the amount of harassment, attacks, and fighting, people continue to live in fear, pain, and silence. Access to mental health services in the isolated villages of the mountains is non-existent. Psychologists from Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) do both individual and group therapy sessions in municipal hospitals and villages.
