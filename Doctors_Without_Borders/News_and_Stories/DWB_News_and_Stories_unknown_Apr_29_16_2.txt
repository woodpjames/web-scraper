MSF’s Questions in Response to the US Military Investigation into Attack on MSF Hospital in Kunduz

Apr 29 16
Life is difficult in Mogadishu, despite recent improvements. More than 370,000 displaced people live in the city with limited access to health care, food and water. Pregnant women in particular are suffering: They give birth in difficult conditions, at the mercy of the slightest complication. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) opened a hospital in Mogadishu in 2011, and the maternity unit has been full ever since.However in the Xadaar district of the city, MSF was recently forced to close its clinic, as security there is tenuous.
