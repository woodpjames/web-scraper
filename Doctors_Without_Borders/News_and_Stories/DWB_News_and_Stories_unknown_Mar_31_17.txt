Mar 31 17
As part of the ongoing emergency response to Ebola in Sierra Leone, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) and the Ministry of Health launched the largest-ever distribution of antimalarials in the country. Teams are providing 1.5 million treatments to residents of Freetown and five districts in the surrounding Western area. The goal is to prevent cases of malaria and also to prevent suspected cases of Ebola during the peak of malaria season.
