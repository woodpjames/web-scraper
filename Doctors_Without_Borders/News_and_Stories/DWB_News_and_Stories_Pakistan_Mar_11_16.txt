The pediatric unit in Niger's Guidan Roumji hospital is overwhelmed. Since the beginning of the year, MSF has treated close to 69,000 malnourished children and 175,000 cases of malaria. Southern Niger is still rife with malnutrition. In July, torrential rains destroyed crops and grain reserves. During the rainy season, malaria-transmitting mosquitoes proliferate. And malnourished children, already weak, run a higher risk of developing a severe form of malaria.
