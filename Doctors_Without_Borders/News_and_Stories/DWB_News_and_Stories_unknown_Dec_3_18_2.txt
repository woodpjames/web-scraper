Report: Indefinite Despair

Dec 3 18
More than 919,000 Rohingya refugees are now in Cox’s Bazar district, living in small bamboo and plastic sheeting shelters on uneven terrain in severely overcrowded makeshift camps. Relocations during the monsoon season, to additional land provided by the government, have prioritized families at immediate risk of landslides and flooding, with limited progress on reducing overcrowding. More suitable land is needed.Hilly terrain also complicates access to health services, particularly for pregnant women, older people, and people living with disabilities. Overcrowding, inhospitable terrain, long distances, and concerns over safety have a disproportionate impact on women’s and girls’ ability to access services. Young, unmarried women in particular are often discouraged from moving beyond their immediate neighborhoods.Access to water, sanitation, hygiene, and other infrastructure is limited. Monsoon season, though milder than expected, brought intense rains that caused flooding and landslides in the camps and local communities and led to injuries, deaths, and damage to infrastructure, including latrines. Cyclone season is now approaching.
