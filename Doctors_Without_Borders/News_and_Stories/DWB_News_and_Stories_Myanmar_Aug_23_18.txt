One year after their forced exodus from Myanmar, Rohingya refugees remain trapped in dire conditions

MSF has now treated more than 4,000 people for diphtheria since December 2017, according to Carla Pla, project medical director for an MSF hospital in Cox's Bazar, in Bangladesh. Nearly 700,000 Rohingya refugees are living in camps in this area.A combination of poor living conditions in the camps and a lack of vaccination coverage for Rohingya children coming from Myanmar has resulted in an outbreak of diphtheria. MSF has responded quickly, treating and vaccinating patients, despite the challenges that come with an outbreak of a disease that has rarely been seen in the last two and a half decades.
