US Signals End to Relief and Recovery Funding for Syria Despite Urgent Needs for Demining and Medical Care 

Apr 4 18
Since the conflict began in eastern Ukraine, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has supported more than 350 health facilities on the both sides of the contact line with donations of medical equipment and medicines to treat war-wounded and people with chronic diseases. MSF teams have also provided mental health counseling, primary health care, and have assisted safe deliveries for pregnant women.Due to the unstable and insecure environment in parts of eastern Ukraine, anxiety-related disorders continue to be the main issue among the patients MSF sees for mental health counseling. Most patients are elderly people suffering from chronic diseases, and MSF has enrolled them in a  program to receive appropriate treatment and longer-term monitoring of their condition.
