Libya: Ongoing Conflict Severely Impacting Medical Care

Apr 26 16
The high number of Syrians registering as refugees at the Domeez camp, near the city of Dohuk in the Kurdish region of Iraq, has overstretched the camp's capacity. Domeez camp was established in April 2012 and was initially designed to host 1,000 families. The population in the camp has now risen above 35,000 people, however. Despite the efforts of the local authorities, the level of assistance is clearly insufficient, and aid workers are struggling to keep up with the needs of all the residents. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is providing thousands of medical consultations every day, has supplied families with water and hygiene kits, and is planning a measles vaccination campaign.
