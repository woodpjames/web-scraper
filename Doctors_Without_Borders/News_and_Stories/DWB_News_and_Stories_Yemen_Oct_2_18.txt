Ahmed was 14 years old when he lost his left arm. “I had gone out to press olives,” remembers the young Syrian. “We were on our way home. A plane flew by and dropped a barrel bomb that exploded, and shrapnel hit my hand. It felt like there was something dripping on my leg. I looked at my arm. It was completely torn off. There was one thread that held my arm to my body. I asked myself, ‘What’s going to happen to me now? It’s finished. I’m dead.’”Ahmed was eventually taken to a hospital run by Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) in Amman, Jordan. Through the hospital’s reconstructive surgery program, Ahmed was among the first patients to receive a custom-designed prosthetic arm created by a 3-D printer. The multi-part device was printed layer by layer, from shoulder socket to fingertips, to fit the teenager’s body and personal requirements. The new arm also goes through an iterative process of testing and refinement to make sure it works well. For Ahmed, it’s a step towards a future he once thought had been robbed from him. “When I grow up, I would love to become an engineer and build a house,” he said. “Just as soon as I go home to our country. I want to live a proper life. A beautiful life. That’s it.”
