May 15 18
Working in a medical post set close to the front line in western Mosul, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) stabilizes trauma patients before transporting them to a hospital with surgical capacity. Between March 25 and early May, 150 people injured by the fighting between the so-called Islamic State and international forces have been stabilized here.
