May 5 16
Salwah, 18 years old, was shot by a sniper in Aleppo, and now she cannot walk. After seeking treatment in several hospitals in Syria, she became a refugee in Turkey where she is now receiving assistance. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is providing her with mental health care. Photographs by Anna Surinyach.
