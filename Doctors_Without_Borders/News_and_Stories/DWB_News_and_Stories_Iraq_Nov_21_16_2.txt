Iraq: As Fighting Intensifies, MSF Bolsters Response Around Mosul

Nov 21 16
South Sudan is the world's youngest country, and many people there count on Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) and others for critical medical care. But on the eve of its third birthday, conflict is tearing the country apart. Over one and a half million people have fled their homes since fighting erupted in December 2013. And as entire towns and villages have come under attack, medical care has also come into the firing line. Violence in hospitals and the destruction of medical facilities are denying medical services to many of South Sudan's most vulnerable people.
