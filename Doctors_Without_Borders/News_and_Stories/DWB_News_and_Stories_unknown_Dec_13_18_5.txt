2018: The Year in Photos

Dec 13 18
This article is part of the Fall 2018 issue of Alert that highlights the urgent medical aid our teams provide to people on the move through Central America and Mexico.There’s no avoiding violence in Honduras, even at home. The streets of major cities like Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula are gripped by crime and conflict. Domestic and sexual violence are also widespread, with women and children bearing the brunt. Corruption, fear of retribution, and limited access to essential health services often leave victims with no protection and few choices but to leave home.To address these issues, MSF launched its servicio prioritario, or priority service, to offer emergency medical and psychological care to victims of violence. In cooperation with the Honduran Ministry of Health, this free and confidential service has treated patients at two health centers and Tegucigalpa’s main hospital since 2011.
