The report "Trapped at the Gates of Europe" raises the alarm about the situation of Sub-Saharan migrants in Morocco. Sub-Saharan migrants making their way to Europe often find themselves trapped in this country, and as EU border nations step up their combat against illegal immigration, the migrants' living conditions worsen. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) staff observed an escalation in intentional violence, and increased numbers of patients abused by Moroccan security forces and sometimes by Spanish security forces. The report also looks at sexual violence endured by female migrants. In the past two years, MSF has treated 700 victims who receive no assistance or protection from the authorities.In spite of the violence, migrants' access to healthcare has somewhat improved, notes the report. With human rights now the number one priority among advocates, MSF has handed over its activities to specialist organizations.
