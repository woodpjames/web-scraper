Displaced People in Nigeria Face Cholera Outbreaks 

Oct 22 15
Since an outbreak of cholera was confirmed in October, MSF teams in Haiti have treated more than 10,000 patients across the country with cholera symptoms. MSF is supporting two Haitian Ministry of Health hospitals in the Artibonite Region, where the cholera outbreak originated. To bolster health clinics in some of the more outlying areas in the north and center of the country—in places such as Gros Morne—MSF is supplying IV solution, oral rehydration salts, IV sets, and hygiene materials. Supplies have also been provided to the hospital in the town of Port de Paix in the country’s far north. MSF is preparing cholera treatment centers in Gonaives and Bassin Bleu. At all four of MSF’s own facilities in Port-au-Prince, teams have treated an increasing number of suspected cases. Two Haitian Ministry of Health hospitals in Port-au-Prince are also receiving support from MSF. A 20-bed cholera treatment center has also been set up in Leogane, where MSF already runs a hospital.In this audio slideshow, MSF epidemiologist Kate Alberti describes what is happening on the ground in Port-au-Prince.
