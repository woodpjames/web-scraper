Dr Abu Huthaifa shares his story as a surgeon working in eastern Aleppo for the past three-and-a-half years.Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) supports eight hospitals in Aleppo city. It runs six medical facilities across northern Syria and supports more than 150 health centers and hospitals across the country, many of them in besieged areas.
