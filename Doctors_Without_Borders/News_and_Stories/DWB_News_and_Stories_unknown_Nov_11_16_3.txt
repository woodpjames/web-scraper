Médecins Sans Frontiėres/Doctors Without Borders (MSF) has been supporting the Mamadou M'Baïki health center in the PK5 Muslim neighborhood of Bangui since December 2013. In May, MSF treated 687 patients for malaria, which remains a primary public health problem in Central African Republic and the leading cause of death among children. It is transmitted by the bite of an Anopheles mosquito carrying the parasite. In 2012, malaria caused an estimated 627,000 deaths worldwide, but is both preventable and curable when caught in time. MSF carries out its activities in Bangui in the constant shadow of violence and also sends a mobile clinic to the Central Mosque of Bangui to assist those unable to -- or afraid to -- visit the Mamadou M'Baïki health center.
