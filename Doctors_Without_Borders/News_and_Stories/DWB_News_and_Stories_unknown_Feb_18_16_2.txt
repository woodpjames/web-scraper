Syria: Statement by Dr. Joanne Liu, International President of MSF

Feb 18 16
The year for MSF draws to a close with uncertainty about the future of health care throughout South Sudan, and uncertainty about the future for the refugees from Sudan. “These people have fled terrible violence in Sudan and lost family members during their arduous journeys for safety,” said Tara Newell, MSF emergency coordinator in Jamam refugee camp. “And now they are sitting exposed in refugee camps on a flood plain and dying from preventable diseases due to horrific living conditions. We have to proceed with a great sense of urgency.”MSF has been active in the region since 1978.
