Australian psychologist Diane Hanna recently returned from her first assignment with Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) in Mosul, Iraq, where she provided mental health care to people displaced by conflict in the city.Here, Diane shares her impressions the powerful artwork she created to help tell the stories of the women and children she met in Mosul.It is impossible to imagine fleeing from your city with buildings burning behind you, gunfire all around you, running with your baby, and the few items you managed to grab.The desperation and hopelessness are depicted in this painting as the sun (or moon) which appears to be the only witness to the suffering, in a culture where public emotional expression is not the norm.
