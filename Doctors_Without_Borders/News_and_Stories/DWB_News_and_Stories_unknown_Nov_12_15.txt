CAR: MSF Reinforces Medical Activities in Bangui Following Renewed Violence

Nov 12 15
MSF set up a mental health care program in the Burj al Barajneh camp on the outskirts of Beirut, Lebanonâ€™s capital, in December 2008. Most of the Palestinian refugee families living here arrived more than 60 years ago, but their mobility has been proscribed and they have struggled to contend with overcrowding, poverty, unemployment, and war. In two years, MSF teams in the project have counseled more than 1,000 patients.
