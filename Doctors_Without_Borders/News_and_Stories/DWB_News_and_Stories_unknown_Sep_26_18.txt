MSF response to first-ever UN tuberculosis summit

Sep 26 18
Domiz refugee camp was established in 2012 in northern Iraq for Syrian refugees fleeing the war. Doctors Without Borders/ Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) launched a sexual reproductive health and maternity project in 2013 to address the risks for pregnant women and babies in the camp. After more than four years, MSF has handed over the project to local health authorities.
