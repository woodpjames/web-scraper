A timeline of crisis and conflict in Yemen

Dec 7 18
Prodjut Roy, 29, is a mental health supervisor with Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF). Since June, he has worked in the primary health center (PHC) in the Nayapara refugee camp in Teknaf, Bangladesh, where tens of thousands of ethnic Rohingya refugees have settled after fleeing targeted violence and persecution in Myanmar. During his time in the camp, Roy has seen first-hand the stigma associated with mental health in the Rohingya community—but also the calm that many patients find through the services of “shanti khana,” which means a place of peace.
