This short video report details a conference co-hosted at Mount Sinai School of Medicine’s Global Health Program in New York by Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) and the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi) that brought researchers, global health experts, and donors together to discuss the profound need for research and development initiatives in the field of neglected diseases. Since these diseases usually affect poor populations, research for finding better drugs and diagnostics for them is scarce.
