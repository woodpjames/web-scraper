The majority of international humanitarian aid is being implemented from the capital city of Damascus and distributed to areas under government control. Aid remains minimal for some seven million Syrians living in opposition-held regions, where conditions continue to worsen.

MSF teams are providing care for patients in neglected areas and training Syrians to give first aid near the front line.
