Fighting to Give Kids "A Fair Shot"

Dec 4 15
The people of Kaabong District, located in the Karamoja region of northeastern Uganda, have the unenviable title of being among the poorest in the country. Large parts of the population suffer from violence and chronic neglect—70 percent cannot access health care. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières' (MSF) purpose in Kaabong is to help strengthen government health services. Teams are supporting nine Ministry of Health centers and the district referral hospital. They also run mobile clinics to isolated areas, offering medical services to the many people who can't reach a health facility on their own.
