The population of Kabul has tripled over the last 10 years. Some people arrive after fleeing conflict-torn areas for the relative safety of the capital, while others, pushed by poverty, are simply trying to make a living. Returnees from Pakistan and other provinces of Afghanistan have also made their way back to the city. For those living in makeshift settlements and camps, the harsh winter makes an already difficult situation even harder. In January 2013, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) started running mobile clinics and nutritional screenings in six locations where hundreds of Afghans have settled.
