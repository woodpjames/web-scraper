The Primary Health Care Center in Pamat, run by Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), is one of very few places in the north of Aweil, South Sudan, where people can get treatment when they are sick. About 1,500 patients are treated per week at the health center and the numbers are increasing with time. During the rainy season, malaria is the most common disease.
