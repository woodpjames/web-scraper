World AIDS Day 2015: Patients and Caregivers in Their Own Words

Dec 1 15
A tribute to photojournalist and MSF friend, Chris Hondros, who was tragically killed in Libya on April 20, 2011.Talented, smart, and immensely generous, photojournalist Chris Hondros, tragically killed on April 20, 2011 in Misrata, Libya, along with his colleague Tim Hetherington, was a friend to many, including Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF).Aid workers and photojournalists often find themselves on the same frontlines, and it seemed that everywhere MSF went in the last decade, Chris would be there too. In Liberia in 2003, MSF doctors treating people wounded during the worst fighting in Monrovia, invited Chris to photograph their work. They trusted his compassion and appreciated his respect for patients and caregivers.Chris never just took photos, he was always thinking about who was on the other side of his lens and what they were experiencing. He wanted his photographs to make a difference, and they did. He donated some of his images to MSF, to help us illustrate the plight of many whose faces and fates might otherwise have remained unseen. A few of those photographs are below.It is with great sadness that we remember Chris. We share our deepest condolences with his family, friends, and colleagues around the world.Kris Torgeson
