DRC: Seeking Shelter from the Violence in Ituri 

Mar 27 18
These photos show the aftermath of an attack on one of the key surgical hospitals in eastern Aleppo during airstrikes on November 17, 2016. The damage was so extensive that the hospital was forced to halt service immediately. The hospital had an emergency room, an intensive care unit, and a number of operating theaters providing orthopedic and general surgery.Access to health care in eastern Aleppo is now nearly nonexistent for a population of more than 250,000 people who desperately need it. They have been trapped under siege for over four months. Since the airstrikes resumed on November 15, heavy bombing and clashes on the ground have left hospitals utterly destroyed.MSF strongly condemns all attacks on civilians and breaches of international humanitarian law perpetrated by all warring parties in Syria.
