Hilde De Clerk is one of Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières' (MSF) most experienced Ebola doctors and has been managing outbreaks of Ebola and similar viruses for more than 10 years. She just returned from North Kivu, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), where the latest outbreak of Ebola has proven difficult to control. New drugs, which might help cure those who have contracted the virus, are available, but offering and administering them is not as easy as it may seem.
