Southern Syria: "We Depend Entirely on Aid"

Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) runs a 30-bed gynecology and obstetrics hospital in Peshawar, Pakistan, that includes a neonatal unit with 15 beds for newborns with serious medical complications. The care offered by MSF is available 24 hours a day and is free, which is much needed considering many private maternity hospitals in Peshawar are inaccessible to women in the region.
