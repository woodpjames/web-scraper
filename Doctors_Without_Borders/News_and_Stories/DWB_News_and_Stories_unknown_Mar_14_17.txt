Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) invited British paralympics champion Richard Whitehead to the MSF trauma surgery project on the Jordan border with Syria to meet patients who have lost limbs in the Syrian conflict. Since September 2013, the MSF team has conducted more than 2,000 major surgeries on over 600 patients.
