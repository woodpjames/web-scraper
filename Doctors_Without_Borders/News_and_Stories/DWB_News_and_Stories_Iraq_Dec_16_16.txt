MSF Treats People Displaced From Mosul, Iraq

Dec 16 16
For Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), the situation in Central African Republic (CAR) was unique: seeing a country descend into violence before its very eyes, being surround by killings and witnessing an entire community being targeted without being able to provide protection.When the Seleka offensive began, MSF teams were already firmly established in the country. This documentary explores many of the questions raised by this situation: Did the teams know what was to come? What did they make of the increasing violence and the events taking place? What operational response was called for? Should MSF call for armed intervention? And what should the international community be doing? What assistance can MSF provide now?
