Greece: Voices from Elliniko

May 25 16
A new drug for the neglected disease sleeping sickness is currently in clinical trials; if the trials are conclusive, Fexinidazole could be registered within two years and sleeping sickness could be eradicated around 2020. This drug would be a vast improvement over current treatment as it's much simpler to administer and thus accessible to many more people. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) and other partner organizations established Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative (DNDi) in 2003 to develop new treatments for neglected diseases, including sleeping sickness.
