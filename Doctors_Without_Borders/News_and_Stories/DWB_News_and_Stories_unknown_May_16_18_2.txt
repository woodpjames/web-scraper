MSNBC: A Look Inside a Hospital in Gaza 

May 16 18
Fighting between Boko Haram and militaries from the areas around southeastern Niger has led to more than 240,000 displaced people and refugees taking shelter in Niger's Diffa region. A third of the displaced people in Diffa have been forced to abandon their homes two or more times due to violence in the last few years. Around the towns of Garin Wazan and Kintchandi, many of the tens of thousands of people who fled Bosso, a town near the Nigeria border last June, have sought safety. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is providing medical and mental health care in these areas but there are still a lot of unmet needs.
