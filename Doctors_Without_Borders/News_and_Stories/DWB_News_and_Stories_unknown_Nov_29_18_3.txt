MSF: Pharmaceutical corporations failing children with HIV

Nov 29 18
A woman screams. Muffled sounds of encouragement from a midwife can be heard through the white door labeled "Delivery Room." It's not long before a baby's sharp cry follows from the room in the temporary health center run by Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) in Likoni, southwest of Mombasa Island. This temporary center is different from most; it's part of an innovative facility called "Container Village," constructed from shipping containers bound together to make a fully functional hospital.
