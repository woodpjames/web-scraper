DRC: MSF treats 20 people after deadly attack in Kasai region

May 25 18
Intercommunal fighting in the province of Tanganyika, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, has displaced nearly half a million people since July 2016. Many of them are living in informal settlements with limited access to health care and alarming shortages of food and water. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is providing a range of humanitarian aid, including medical care and water, but more aid is needed.
