In 1981, starting in refugee camps in Thailand, MSF began developing ready-to-use medical kits custom designed for specific emergencies, geographic conditions, and climates as well as standardized medical guidelines to streamline delivery of care. In 1988, the World Health Organization (WHO) adopted the concept with its “emergency health kit.” MSF now employs medical and logistics kits for a wide range of crisis situations, from quickly setting up an operating room to launching a mass vaccination campaign.
