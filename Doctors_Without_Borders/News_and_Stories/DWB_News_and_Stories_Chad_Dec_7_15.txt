Chad: MSF Teams Provide Support after Deadly Attack in Koulfoua Island

Charles Sako lives and works in Kibera, a deprived area of Kenya's capital Nairobi. He, along with Catherine Atieno and Siama Musine, is HIV positive and receives treatment through MSF's clinic in Kibera. Six years ago, they were all given disposable cameras for a week to document their lives on HIV treatment. From those photos, we created a project called 'My Life with HIV'.Now, ahead of a UN Summit on HIV/AIDS this week in New York, we've been back to visit them and to hear how their lives have moved on. The latest scientific research shows that treating people with HIV/AIDS not only saves lives but also can prevent the virus from spreading. The full, busy and vibrant lives you'll see portrayed here are the living proof of the benefits HIV treatment has brought to individuals, their families and wider communities.
