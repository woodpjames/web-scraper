Phumeza Tisile, a former extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) patient, took the DR-TB Manifesto to the 67th World Health Assembly in Geneva, Switzerland, in May 2014. More than 55,000 people signed the petition that calls for urgent action to improve treatment for people living with DR-TB. After giving a speech to the delegates gathered for the WHA, she handed over the petition signatures to Dr. Mario Raviglione, director of the Global TB department at the World Health Organization.Thank you to everyone who signed the TB Manifesto. The petition is now closed, but you can see the signatures and read more about the disease and what DR-TB patients go through under the currently available treatment: https://www.msfaccess.org/TBmanifesto/
