Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) medical staff who work at projects in the field have seen first-hand the effects of unsafe abortions.MSF is concerned that the reinstatement and expansion of the Global Gag Rule, which cuts US funding from any organization working oversees that even speaks about the option of abortion to beneficiaries, will result in more maternal mortality."When organizations aren’t able to discuss family planning or abortion with patients, the result is more unwanted pregnancies, more abortions and more deaths from unsafe abortion," said MSF OBGYN Veronica Ades.
