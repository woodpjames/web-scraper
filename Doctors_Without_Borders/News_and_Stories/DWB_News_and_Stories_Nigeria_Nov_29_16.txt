Nigeria: Tackling Malnutrition in Borno State

The violent conflict set off by former Ivory Coast president Laurent Gbagbo’s refusal to step down after his electoral defeat morphed into several months of intense fighting between different groups. While it has abated to a certain extent, many of the people who fled their homes are not returning. They fear the conflict could flare up again or have nothing to return to, because their homes and fields were burned.Most health care facilities in the west are not functioning, and in the eastern city of Abidjan, shortages of medical supplies persist. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is working in both areas, and in Liberia, where an estimated 142,331 Ivorian refugees have taken shelter, according to the United Nations.
