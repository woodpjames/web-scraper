Nigeria, meningitis C: “The lack of diagnostics and available treatments are the main challenges” 

May 31 17
One year after fighting broke out in eastern Ukraine, people living in the heavily affected Lugansk region are trying to get back a sense of normalcy. Schools have reopened and residents came out in the first days of spring to sweep the debris of war off the streets. However, with the health care system under intense strain, and medical supply lines cut or severely disrupted since last summer, people continue to struggle to access basic health care and medicines. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) runs mobile clinics in 32 locations in Lugansk region to provide care to residents and to displaced people. Teams carry out an average of 2,275 consultations per week.
