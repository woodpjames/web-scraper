Northern Bahr el Ghazal is South Sudan's poorest state. It has one principal hospital in the main town of Aweil, and Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) runs the facility in partnership with the Ministry of Health. The hospital caters to the entire state - an estimated population of up to 1.2 million.At the end of 2015, a catastrophic malaria outbreak affected Northern Bahr el Ghazal. Many of these patients are in a critical condition as drug shortages in surrounding health facilities have forced people to travel long distances to reach care, thereby reducing their chances of survival.
