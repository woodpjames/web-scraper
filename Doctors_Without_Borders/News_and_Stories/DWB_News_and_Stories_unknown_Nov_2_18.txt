Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) provides essential medical care in this remote corner between the Phow and White Nile rivers, where the land becomes a giant swamp during the rainy season from May to October each year.MSF's hospital in Old Fangak is often the only place where people in the region can receive treatment for serious conditions. In this feature for Exposure, photographer Frédéric Noy documents the many challenges that patients and medical workers face in a difficult environment.
