Greece: "At Home We Had War, But at Least We Had Dignity"

Sep 18 15
Last November, MSF launched the last installment of Condition: Critical, a project aiming to give a voice to the people living through the war in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Since then, nearly 2,000 people left messages of support for the people of Eastern Congo on the Condition: Critical message map. The first of these messages have already arrived in Congo and more are to follow. This video shows messages being delivered by MSF staff and the reaction of local people to them.
