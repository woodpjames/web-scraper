Women and children are extremely vulnerable to sexual violence during times of conflict. Rape is frequently used by armed groups as a weapon of war, and in places where law and order have crumbled, vulnerable people simply have no recourse, leaving attackers to act with impunity. Such is the case in Central African Republic (CAR), where the brutal fighting continues. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) began offering treatment to survivors of sexual violence in Bangui, CAR's capital, in July 2014.
