Daynile Hospital in Somalia's Mogadishu suburbs is open again after a six-month closure due to security concerns. There is very limited health care in Somalia and people from far and wide rely on this Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) hospital. Many patients receive surgical treatment for injuries during sporadic fighting; the team also sees chronic health problems such as diabetes and high blood pressure.
