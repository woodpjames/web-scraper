South Sudan: “I Am Tired of Running”

Mar 16 17
Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) decided to try using unmanned aerial vehicles to gather sputum tests for patients suspected of having TB in a remote area of Papua New Guinea. The tests were then flown back to the hospital where they were tested in a lab. This could be a new, revolutionary model for diagnostics that MSF repeats in other remote areas where roads and waterways are not feasible for travel.
