MSF Statement Regarding the Humanitarian Crisis in Rakhine State, Myanmar

Sep 13 17
Sierra Leone has finally been declared Ebola-free, but many of the 4,000 survivors of this deadly epidemic continue to suffer. They report having painful joints, chronic fatigue, vision or hearing impairment, as well as depression and post-traumatic stress. It is difficult for them to get treatment, and people still fear Ebola survivors. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is working to assist them.
