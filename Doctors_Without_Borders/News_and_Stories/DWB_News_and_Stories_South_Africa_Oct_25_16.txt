South Africa: New Drug Offers Hope for Patients Fighting Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis

Oct 25 16
The cholera outbreak in Juba, the capital of South Sudan, continues to spread. As of late May, 733 cholera cases had been officially reported. The majority of cases continue to be treated in the main Ministry of Health hospital in the city, Juba Teaching Hospital. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) opened a dedicated 100-bed cholera treatment center in the Gudele 2 as well as three oral rehydration points. The plan is to have enough capacity to treat all patients if the epidemic accelerates, and to reduce some of the pressure on the very busy Juba Teaching Hospital.
