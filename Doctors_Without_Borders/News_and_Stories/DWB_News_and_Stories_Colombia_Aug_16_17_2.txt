The conflict in Yemen continues, with the country divided between the Houthi movement, supported by former president Saleh, and an anti-Houthi coalition of mainly Gulf states led by Saudi Arabia. Yemen's President Hadi of the transitional government fled to Saudi Arabia in March.Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is working to provide medical care in Aden, Al-Dhale’, Taiz, Sa’ada, Amran, Hajja, Ibb, and Sana’a. While the political struggle unfolds, civilians are caught in the crossfire. MSF is responding to the needs of civilians affected by violence, but it remains extremely difficult to move within the country to evaluate needs and provide assistance, due to the fighting and the airstrikes.Here, several MSF staff in Yemen describe what they are seeing and the difficulties they face.
