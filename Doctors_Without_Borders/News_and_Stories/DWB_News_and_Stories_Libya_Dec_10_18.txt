Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has deployed a local team to Central Sulawesi, Indonesia, following a devastating earthquake and tsunami on September 28.A team of Indonesian MSF colleagues composed of medical, water and sanitation, and logistics specialists, traveled to the affected areas to assess the situation. In collaboration with the Ministry of Health (MoH) team on the ground, MSF evaluated the needs in remote and rural areas, as the massive government response is concentrated mainly in the areas around the Palu City coastline and Petobo to the south. After initial constraints in transportation and access to various locations, our team managed to reach the affected areas, mainly around the sub-district of South Dolo, Sigi, and further north along the west coast of Donggala district, which is home to over 50,000 people.
