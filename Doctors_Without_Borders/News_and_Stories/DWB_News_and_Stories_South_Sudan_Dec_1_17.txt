Omer from Pakistan gives a terrible account of how refugees are treated in Turkey and how now he has been held in a detention center on Samos, Greece."Back in Syria, I was shot at and hit five times. I was treated by an MSF team in Jordan. I'm on my own here. I'm heading to Germany to be with my uncle. I got hit by a bullet in the arm and another in the chest. It's very cold here and we don't have warm clothes." - These are the words of Saleh, a young Syrian refugee currently held in the detention center in Samos, Greece.
