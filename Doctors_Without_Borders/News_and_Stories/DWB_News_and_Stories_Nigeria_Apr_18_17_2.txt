On their journey through the Balkans to seek safety and assistance in Europe, many asylum-seekers, refugees, and migrants become stranded in forests and abandoned buildings in Serbia. They struggle through the cold weather without sufficient food or shelter, and have limited access to basic medical care. What's more, they are often exposed to criminal networks, physical attacks, and robberies.The European Union (EU) asylum system has so far failed to offer them aid and protection upon arrival. Not allowed to continue through the EU, they have no choice but to use irregular migration routes. Many have already experienced appalling conditions while being detained in Greece and Macedonia. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) teams are providing them with essential relief items and urgently needed medical care, while calling on the Serbian authorities and European Union member states to provide the asylum seekers with aid and protection.
