Refugees Struggle with Biting Cold, Lack of Facilities in Serbia

Jan 18 17
Renewed fighting flared this week in the PK5 district of Bangui, Central African Republic, where some 2,200 Muslims remain. The Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) teams working in Bangui General Hospital received 31 wounded patients in a single day and are trying to manage the high influx of injured patients. Another MSF team in the PK5 health center was forced to suspend medical activities and seek shelter in the safe room before they were evacuated due to the violence. Here is a look at the care the teams have been providing.
