Drones as Humanitarian Tools

Agathe Farini Sena, otherwise known as Maman Agathe, is a counselor at the Village d’Accueil, or Home Village, in North Kivu, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), where women with high-risk pregnancies stay as they wait to give birth. By staying here, they have access to high-quality health care at the adjacent MSF-supported Masisi general hospital, where last year MSF and Ministry of Health teams delivered more than 3,000 babies. Maman Agathe makes sure the 70-odd mothers-to-be staying at the Village d’Accueil are happy, healthy, and at ease in the days before the big event. She helps these women—many of whom have been displaced or otherwise affected by North Kivu’s decades-long war—as they settle into the facility.
