Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), in partnership with the Ministry of Health, is running a comprehensive pediatric program in Konseguela, Mali. One in five children in that country don’t live to see their fifth birthday. This program aims to prevent and treat the main causes of child mortality, including malaria and pneumonia, as well as malnutrition which is a catalyst for childhood diseases.
