MSF Builds New Hospital for Rohingya Refugees

Jan 8 18
More than one year after the first influx of refugees began, some 1,000 people fleeing political unrest in Burundi continue to cross the border each week to Tanzania. They join thousands of others living in overcrowded and ever-expanding refugee camps. Two of the three existing sites—Nyarugusu and Nduta—have already swelled to capacity. A third camp, Mtendeli, is now receiving refugees transferred from the overcrowded Nyarugusu camp, as well as newly arrived refugees from the border areas. There are now approximately 140,000 Burundians living in Tanzania.
