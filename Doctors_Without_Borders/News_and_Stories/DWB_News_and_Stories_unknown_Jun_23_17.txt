This Month in Focus, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières Borders (MSF) highlights our teams' work in Gaza and stories of women living there. We also focus on migrants and refugees crossing the Mediterranean; we revisit MSF's intervention in Bosnia between 1993 and 2003; warn about the implications of EU countries and the U.S. pushing company profits over people's health; and discuss the current situation in Ukraine.
