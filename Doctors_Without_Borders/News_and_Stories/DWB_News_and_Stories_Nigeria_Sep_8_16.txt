Northern Nigeria: Reaching Those Most in Need of Care

Sep 8 16
While there has been much progress in maternal health care in Afghanistan over the past decade, the country is still one of the most dangerous places in the world for a woman to give birth. Insecurity means that many women hesitate to make the long, dangerous, and often expensive journey to health facilities that offer quality maternal care. Too many women still die preventable deaths because they do not have access to the essential care they need.Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) provides emergency obstetric services in three hospitals in Afghanistan—in Khost in the east, Helmand in the south, and in eastern Kabul. Across MSF’s maternity wards in 2013, medical staff delivered more than 33,500 babies.
