Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is setting up an inflatable field hospital in Arughat, Nepal, a town in Gorkha district, approximately 83 miles northwest of the capital, Kathmandu. The 20-bed hospital will come equipped with operating facilities, as well as an obstetrics and maternity unit, and will provide critical health services in the wake of the April 25 earthquake."This facility here is replacing the health center that was destroyed in the earthquake and which provides health care to the 10,000 inhabitants living here in Arughat, as well as the 40,000 people in the small, inaccessible villages in the surrounding health district," says Dr. Jean-Paul Delain.
