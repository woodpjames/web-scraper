Estrella has been pregnant and living in a camp for displaced people in Bangui, the capital of Central African Republic, since violence drove her from her neighborhood in the city. The M’Poko Camp, near Bangui international airport, hosts around 40,000 people. The assistance there is insufficient. People lack water, food, and shelter.MSF is running a field hospital and three health posts in M’Poko Camp.
