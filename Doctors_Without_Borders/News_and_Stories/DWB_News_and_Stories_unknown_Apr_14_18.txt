International Chagas Day: MSF Launches Campaign to Raise Awareness

Severine Caluwaerts is a Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) OBGYN in Khost, Afghanistan, at MSF's largest maternity project. This is her seventh time in Khost."I’m doing exactly the job that made me study medicine so many years ago, to help people who most need help," said Caluwaerts. "Afghanistan is a war-torn country. Our patients are continuously confronted with the war. Families lose husbands, children die, mothers die. And what MSF is offering them is a safe place to deliver."
