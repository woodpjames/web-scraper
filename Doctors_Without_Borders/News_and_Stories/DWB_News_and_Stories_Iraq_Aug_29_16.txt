MSF Treating Iraqis Affected by Civil War

Aug 29 16
As the war in Syria rages and entry restrictions in other countries grow more restrictive, ever greater numbers of Syrian refugees have made their way to Bulgaria. This year, in fact, nearly 10,000 migrants and refugees, the majority from Syria, have arrived in the country, an unexpected influx that has put pressure on the Bulgarian authorities’ capacity to provide proper shelter and health care.Significant improvements are still needed for the winter. After observing terrible living conditions in reception centers in the Bulgarian capital city of Sofia and in makeshift camps in the southern part of the country, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontierès (MSF) began providing medical care in the worst-affected areas.
