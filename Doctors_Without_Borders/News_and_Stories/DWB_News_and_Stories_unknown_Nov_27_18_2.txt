Endemic across the region, acute malnutrition affects children under five in the rural provinces of the Sahel as well as in N’Djamena, the Chadian capital. But this season it has reached alarming proportions in this city of 1.5 million inhabitants.“It has become critical this year, due to a worsening economic situation that followed the drop in oil prices,” explains Chibuzo Okonta, deputy program manager for emergencies for Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF).MSF launched an emergency response on July 26 in partnership with the Ministry of Health, opening an inpatient therapeutic feeding center (ITFC) in the neighborhood of Ndjari. The ITFC has been set up to treat children aged six months to five years suffering from severe acute malnutrition and associated medical complications.
