Southern Syria: "We Are Talking About a War Where the Civilian Population Itself is Targeted"

Apr 11 17
Irina Savchuk is staying with her children at a center for displaced people in the Ukrainian town of Konstantinovka. The center, formerly a shelter for homeless people, was under reconstruction when the conflict started in eastern Ukraine. Although it wasn’t yet finished, the local authorities decided to open the center for people who had to flee the fighting in nearby areas. It’s now run by local people, and eight families live in the center, sharing the small kitchen and old bathroom. Irina shares her story and Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) psychologist Elena Bogatskaya discusses the enormous emotional impact of the violence.
