MSF Report: Eritrean Refugees Dying En Route to Europe

Feb 27 17
The largest outbreak of Ebola ever recorded has claimed 2,811 lives since it was officially declared on March 22. MSF staff working at Ebola projects in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone are stretched to capacity, and in some places they are having to turn away sick patients. After repeated calls to the international community for assistance, some countries have started committing assets and personnel. To date, however, too little action has taken place on the ground. People continue to suffer from and spread the disease.Still, some patients, like those pictured here, have beaten the odds and survived, showing what can be possible with timely care.
