Fighting Ebola in DRC: "It’s a race against time"

Jun 7 18
The Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) head of mission in Libya describes the fate of migrants who fall prey to human smugglers. Those with insufficient money, or luck, can be held prisoner for weeks, or even months. Forced to work for nothing, living in appalling conditions, worse than those in the detention centers, many of them do not survive. MSF is helping to collect and identify these often anonymous bodies and giving them a decent burial.
