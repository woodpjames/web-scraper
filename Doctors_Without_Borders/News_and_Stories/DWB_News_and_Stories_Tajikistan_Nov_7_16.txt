The World Health Organization published a report on resistance to antibiotics at the end of April. The first of its kind, it sounded the alarm on this insufficiently documented issue where infected wounds won't heal despite treatment. Doctors Without Borders/Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) had already observed the phenomena, notably in its surgical program in Amman, Jordan where, three quarters of patients from Iraq have infections due to resistant bacteria.
