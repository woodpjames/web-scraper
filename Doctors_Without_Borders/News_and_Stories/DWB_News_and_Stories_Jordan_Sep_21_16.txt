Jordan: Syrians Denied Access to Lifesaving Medical Care for Third Consecutive Month

Sep 21 16
When Sonia was seven months pregnant, a wave of extreme violence struck Bangui, the capital of Central African Republic. She had to flee her neighborhood with her parents and take refuge at the M’Poko camp near Bangui international airport. Today, the M’Poko Camp hosts around 40,000 people. The assistance there is insufficient. People lack water, food, and shelter and now the rainy season is approaching, which is certain to make things worse.MSF is running a field hospital and three health posts in the camp. Every day, MSF teams provide more than 1,000 consultations and help at least 10 women give birth. Today Sonia was one of those women.
