Nigeria: MSF Scales Up Efforts to Contain Cholera Outbreak in Maiduguri

Sep 1 17
Three weeks after the bombing in Kunduz, Afghanistan, our MSF colleagues gathered together for the first time on the grounds of the ruined hospital.They took this opportunity to send their deep appreciation to everyone around the world who has been standing in solidarity with them since the terrible events of October 3, when repeated aerial attacks that targeted the hospitalâ€™s main building resulted in the loss of 13 colleagues and 10 patients, along with seven others who have yet to be identified.Thank you to everyone who has supported MSF and the Kunduz staff. Please keep up the pressure, and keep spreading the word. We need the world to ask for an independent investigation and to stand up for the protected status of hospitals in Afghanistan, and all across the globe.Sign the petition, because Even Wars Have Rules: change.org/evenwarshaverules
