There are still 50,000 refugees living in M'Poko camp at Bangui airport in Central African Republic. The authorities want them to go home but this is not an option for those who sought refuge at Bangui airport five months ago. The MSF teams have provided 90,000 consultations in this camp since the beginning of the year.
