Feb 25 16
Mirlanda's strength and family support have made her a survivor; MSF medical care has been crucial to her pulling through. When she was 10, Mirlanda lost one of her legs due to the 2010 earthquake. She spent a year and a half in surgeries, recovery, and physiotherapy at MSFâ€™s temporary tent hospital. Today she is a bright and upbeat young girl who looks ahead to the future, but she and her family must live with the effects of the past.This is one of three videos in an MSF Insight video package on the lasting effects of the 2010 earthquake in Haiti.
