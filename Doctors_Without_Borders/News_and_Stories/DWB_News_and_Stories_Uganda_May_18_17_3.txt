South Sudanese Refugees in Uganda: "Starting Life All Over Again"

May 18 17
Heavy fighting between Afghan forces and armed opposition groups in the northeastern province of Kunduz has transformed what had been considered one of the more stable provinces in the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan into a war-zone. Fighting in the province has increased significantly since 2014.Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) provides surgical care for trauma patients, including 7-year old Feroz and his father. They were on their way to the market when they were hit by a bomb blast. They travelled more than 62 miles to MSF's hospital, the only facility able to treat their injuries in their region.
