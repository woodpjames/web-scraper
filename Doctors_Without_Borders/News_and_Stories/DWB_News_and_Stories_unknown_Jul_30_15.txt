In response to chronically high rates of malnutrition in the Northern region of Burkina Faso, MSF launched nutrition programs there in September 2007, in the areas of Titao and Yako. As of June 2008, MSF had treated a total of 13,600 children under five years of age, and 90 percent of them had recovered. Here, MSF staff and parents of malnourished children speak describe the program.
