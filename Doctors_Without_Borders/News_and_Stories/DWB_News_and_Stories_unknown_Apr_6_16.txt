Doctors Without Borders Photo Exhibit Highlights Conflict and Health Needs in CAR

Apr 6 16
The conflict in Syria has forced hundreds of thousands of people to flee their country for neighboring Lebanon. According to a Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) study conducted in May 2012, over half of the refugees are living in unsanitary conditions with no access to desperately needed medical care. MSF teams working in Tripoli and the Bekaa Valley are providing refugees with free health care and distributing supplies, but the medical facilities are often overwhelmed. MSF continues to ramp up its activities in the country.
