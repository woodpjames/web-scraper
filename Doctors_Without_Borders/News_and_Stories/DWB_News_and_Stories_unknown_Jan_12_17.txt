Jan 12 17
Sierra Leone has been hit the hardest with over 450 confirmed cases of Ebola at the beginning of August. In Kailahun, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is running a 64 bed treatment center. Despite the lack of a cure for the virus, doctors are able to treat the symptoms of the disease: diarrhea, vomiting, and high fever. A psychologist is also working with patients and their families. Some 200 community health workers are educating the local population about the disease and the necessary measures to take.
