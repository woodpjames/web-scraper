Tending Deep Wounds in Mexico 

Oct 4 18
As fighting flared in Mosul, Iraq, in late 2016, MSF project coordinator Arnaud Badinier was asked if he could build a mobile surgical facility that could move quickly with the shifting front lines. He had two weeks to come up with the design. Working with a team that included two other experienced logisticians and a nurse, they designed the MUST—a Mobile Unit Surgical Trailer.Within months, the MUST was built and deployed to a village just south of Mosul, making it the closest surgical facility to the front line. The first patients were treated on February 16, 2017. The mobile unit gives MSF staff the flexibility to quickly reach people in need of lifesaving trauma surgery while ensuring hygienic, temperature controlled conditions in war zones and places hit by natural disasters.The MUST was designed to be an operating theater onwheels, said Badinier. “The benefit of this project is the mobility. It’s easier to reach patients in really complex situations, and that gives the team the ability to deploy a full set of tools quickly and efficiently.”
