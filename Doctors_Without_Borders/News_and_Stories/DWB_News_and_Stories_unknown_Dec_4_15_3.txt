It’s showtime for the zip-zap circus in Cape Town. All these children are HIV-positive. But that doesn’t prevent them from living a very active and creative live, because they are all receiving antiretroviral treatment.

	In this five-part video series, MSF demonstrates tools and models that could help make improved treatment accessible to many more. Between June 8 and 10, 2011, world leaders will meet in New York to decide on the future of the millions needing treatment urgently. By sharing this video, help us spread the word that there is NO EXCUSE for governments to leave 10 million people untreated! See www.doctorswithoutborders.org/stopthevirus for more info.
