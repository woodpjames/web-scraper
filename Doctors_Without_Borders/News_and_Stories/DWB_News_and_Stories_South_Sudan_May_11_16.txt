May 11 16
MSF has been providing assistance in Yida since December 2011. The organization currently runs a primary health care center (providing an average of 10,000 consultations per month) and a 60-bed hospital with a malnutrition unit, and sends mobile teams throughout the camp. MSF is also involved in water supply and latrine construction. From May 2012 to May 2013, MSF treated nearly 3,000 severely malnourished children in Yida.
