Hundreds of thousands of refugees have crossed the Aegean Sea this year to get to one of the Greek islands close to Turkey. When they land on Samos island after a grueling hours-long crossing in total darkness, they need to get warm and find out where they are.Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) works with local volunteers and asks them to let the team know when they see boats approaching so they can assist the refugees as quickly as possible.
