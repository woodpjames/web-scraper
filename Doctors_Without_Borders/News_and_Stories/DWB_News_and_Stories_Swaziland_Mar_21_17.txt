More than half of the 5,000 deaths due to the ongoing Ebola outbreak in West Africa have been in Liberia. The strain on the health system makes it difficult if not impossible to get care for anything else, including malaria. Malaria and Ebola share some of the same initial symptoms and people often come to Ebola treatment center with malaria thinking they may have Ebola, which puts them at risk for contracting Ebola. To prevent these issues, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has been distributing malaria prevention kits in West Point, a poor neighborhood in Monrovia.
