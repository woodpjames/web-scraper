Greece: Refugees "Trapped Without a Future" in Elliniko Camp

Oct 3 16
When epidemiologists with Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) recorded a high child mortality rate at the Yida refugee camp in South Sudan, MSF took action. Vaccine-preventable diseases, including pneumonia, were killing the camp’s children.Medical and logistical teams responded with a vaccination campaign that included one of the first uses of PCV pneumococcal vaccine in a humanitarian emergency. To mark World Immunization Week, we are sharing the following images of some of the mothers and their children who MSF vaccinated during the campaign.MSF’s four key goals for improving access to vaccination in the year ahead are: greater temperature tolerance, lower prices, an end to age limits for receiving missed doses, and reduced roadblocks to vaccine use in humanitarian emergencies.
