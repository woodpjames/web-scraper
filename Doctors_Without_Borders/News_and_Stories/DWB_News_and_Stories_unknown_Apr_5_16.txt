In 2011, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) and other researchers carried out five separate retrospective mortality surveys in prefectures accounting for the majority of the country's population. The results showed mortality above what is considered to be the “emergency threshold.”These photos document photographer Corentin Fohlen's visit to the pediatrics, surgery, maternity, medicine, HIV, and tuberculosis wards of Paoua Hospital, where MSF has worked since 2006.
