Chemoprevention is a new prevention strategy for malaria that helps to reduce the number of children becoming ill during the July-to-October peak period. This new strategy has been a success in the Madaoua district in south Niger. It has proved easy to implement and effective in reducing the number of malaria cases. Combined with other ways of combating the disease, such as providing access to screening, treatment, and insecticide-treated bed-nets, it can have a real impact on the number of cases and mortality rates.
