What is Cholera?

May 22 17
A meningitis epidemic is sweeping across Niger and has already infected more than 6,500 people and claimed 443 lives, according to health authorities. The illness is simple to treat but the patient must receive immediate care. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), in collaboration with the Ministry of Health, is providing free medical care for patients. Teams are supporting local health centers in the capital, Niamey, which has been hit hard, to treat simple cases, while referring severe cases to Lazaret hospital, where more than 2,500 patients have been admitted since March 23.
