The autonomous island of Bougainville is slowly emerging from decades of conflict. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) set up medical facilities in Buin, a remote village in the south of the island, in June 2011. Admissions to the maternity unit, have steadily increased since the project's inception.Expectant mothers are referred by small clinics in the area. They spend several days here before giving birth to avoid traveling on rough roads during labor. MSF is also supporting an awareness-raising campaign to teach women about a new program for victims of sexual violence. Up until now, there has been no such treatment available in Bougainville.
