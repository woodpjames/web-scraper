Some 900 people across Haut Uélé province, in northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), have been murdered since the end of 2008, in a string of brutal attacks by the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA), an armed group active in Uganda and Sudan for over two decades. The systematic violence has forced tens of thousands of civilians to flee their homes and shelter in makeshift structures such as this one. They are receiving little assistance.
