Adele is an MSF midwife in the largest maternity ward in in Central African Republic. Every day, she and her colleagues treat women with difficult deliveries and complications from unsafe abortions—with the added pressure of working in a war zone. “As we are working, we hear gunshots,” says Adele. “The helicopters start flying around. So we are really stressed.” Despite the challenges, she says she is determined to continue her work as a midwife. “I am really glad because I have been able to save many lives.”
