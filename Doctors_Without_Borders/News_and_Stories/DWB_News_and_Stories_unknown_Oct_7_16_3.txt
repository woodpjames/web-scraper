Eastern Aleppo: 23 Attacks on Hospitals Since July; No Hospital Left Undamaged

Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) increasingly calls on the services of physiotherapists during its emergency interventions. Integral to post-surgery, their work is key to the delivery of quality care. As is often the case in emergency settings, the physiotherapists don't need sophisticated equipment. Some simple movements can help stave off complications for the patient. In countries where infrastructure has been wiped out, part of the doctor's work is helping wounded people regain their independence. Physiotherapy helps to ensure that when they leave the hospital, patients will be able to go back to their lives and jobs, and look after their families.
