East Aleppo's Few Remaining Medics Struggle to Treat Waves of Wounded

Oct 9 16
On April 26th, a group of armed former Seleka fighters entered the Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) hospital in Boguila in northern Central African Republic and carried out a brutal attack that left 16 people dead, including three MSF staff. In protest, and to underline the need for humanitarian work, the 2,300 people employed by MSF in CAR are reducing their activities to emergency medical care only for a week.
