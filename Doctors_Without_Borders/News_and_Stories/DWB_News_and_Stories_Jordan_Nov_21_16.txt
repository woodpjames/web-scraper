Syria: Desperate Conditions Worsen Five Months After Jordanian Border Closure

The three refugee camps run by the office of the United Nations High Commissoner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Dadaab, Kenya, 50 miles from Somalia, are full. But more and more people arrive here every day. An extension to one of the camps could provide a temporary solution to providing shelter for new arrivals who now must create shelters from nothing in the barren desert. But the extension lies half-built and empty due to a breakdown in negotiations between the Kenyan authorities and the UNHCR. So the new arrivals remain in the desert with nowhere to go.
