Honduras: Mental Health Care for Victims of Violence

Jan 26 17
A camp in a lake, a flooded hospital, and huts under water. With the onset of the rainy season, the tens of thousands of South Sudanese refugees in Lietchuor, Ethiopia, are even more vulnerable. This was Lietchuor refugee camp at the end of Augustâ€”a lake of half-submerged huts. Water stagnates on the flat, bare terrain, making the camp uninhabitable for the 36,000 refugees during the rainy season. The only dry area is alongside the road running through the camp.
