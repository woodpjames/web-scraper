Dadaab refugee camp in Kenya has sheltered refugees fleeing Somalia for over 25 years. Now the largest refugee camp in the world, Dadaab is currently home to some 277,000 displaced people, many of whom were born and raised inside the camp.While living conditions are poor for residents, at least humanitarian assistance is guaranteed for essentials such as food and medical care.  On May 6, 2016, the Kenyan government announced the impending closure of the camp, which would force residents of Dadaab to return to Somalia against their will.Ella Watson-Stryker talks about the findings of a recent MSF study she led in the camp, asking residents how they feel about being sent back to Somalia. The survey revealed that the majority of respondents are afraid to go back; their top fears include the lack of health care services and high risk of sexual violence in Somalia.
