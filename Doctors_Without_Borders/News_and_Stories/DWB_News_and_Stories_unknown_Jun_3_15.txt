MSF Calls on G7 Leaders to Take Concrete Action to Fight Epidemics

Jun 3 15
Over the past 18 months, MSF has vaccinated more than 500,000 children in a continuing campaign against measles in some of the most inaccessible areas of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). MSF nurse Jessica Nestrell is coordinating the vaccination campaign.Over the past 18 months, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins     Sans Frontières (MSF) has vaccinated more than 500,000 children in a continuing     campaign against measles in some of the most inaccessible areas of the Democratic     Republic of Congo (DRC). The next stage of the campaign will cover another     100,000 children in hundreds of villages across     the region of Basankusu in the northeastern Equateur Province; an     area slightly larger than Connecticut, but only accessible by dugout canoe     or, at best, motorbike. MSF nurse Jessica Nestrell is coordinating the vaccination     campaign.On August 14, I left the pollution of Kinshasa, the capital   of the DRC, to head to Equateur Province, where I will be running a measles   vaccination campaign for the next six months.he heat is really striking. Mbandaka, the provincial capital   is situated right under the equator. The dampness in the air rots everything   fast and it is impossible to keep anything dry. Seasoned international volunteers   have told me that the clothes start to rot on the shelf if they are not used   fast enough.The Basankusu area is where we will do the vaccination. There   are 245 villages along the trails in the forest accessible by motorcycle and   251 small villagesâ€”that       we know ofâ€”by the rivers. With an additional number of 41 villages hidden       deep into the forest, extremely inaccessible. It all adds up to 540 villages       in total, although we suspect that there are a lot more along the rivers.       All these villages have to be visited even if there is only a single child       in a village of just a few people. The aim of the campaign is to track       down 100 percent of the target population.But before this can even get         started, we have to plan, which includes identifying the villages, routes,         and staff. So it will begin with a series of exploratory missions, visiting         the health posts to lay the groundwork for the campaign. The map we had         was virtually useless, but we estimated that it would be possible to   visit all 18 health posts in one week.We left Mbandaka in the small MSF Cessna     plane that does all the surveys in the area. Before we left, I had been to     the office to pick up the survival kit and camping gear for living in the   bush. I really do not like flying, but through the front window I was able   to have a good look at the terrain where I will be working for the next few   months. As I sat there and watched everything pass by I began to understand   why this area was a white spot on the map long after all other continents of   the world had been explored. It is just dense rainforest. As the pilot said, "like   a head of broccoli."My team consists of a Congolese logistician, a     driver, and me. I sit jammed between the luggage and the driver. Some of   the rivers we cross are so deep we have to use a dugout canoe. Sometimes there     are the remnants of a bridge, but they are usually half sunken and so narrow     that it is useless, even on foot. As for the bike travel, I hurt my knees   from constantly crashing through branches and vegetation. I finally had to   stop and put bandages over my jeans as protection. After I put some big leaves   in the bandages, it worked quite well.Throughout the journey, we stop at       different health posts and talk to the staff to find out about the population,       complete the number of villages on the map and ask about distances, if it     is possible to use motorcycle, canoe, or if you have to go by foot. You rely     on maps for basic information, but everything has to be checked with the locals.We     also have to try to identify if there are people in the villages around the                   health posts that we might use in the campaign, people with   medical background, or people who can simply just read and write. The years   of war in the DRC have left few people with access to education.Since there     has been a small measles epidemic recently in the Basankusu area we ask at     each health post about how many cases were reported. The information given     was usually an estimate and many of the children who had suffered from measles     had, in fact, already been vaccinated.This is not a good sign as it indicates     that the previous vaccination had been done badly. Another factor may be   that the mothers of the children who are sick just do not remember, or know,   if the child was vaccinated for measles or not. That is why we try to give   different vaccinations in different places of the body; a mark on the bottom   means measles and on the arm, polio.By the time we finish in the evening it     is usually dark and we still have to find somewhere to sleep. We sleep wherever     we can, in consultation rooms,                           tents and in people's huts. One night I stayed in one                           of the two rooms of a villager's                           house that was close to the health post. Since it was                           quite a large family, there were people coming and                           going all the time. I was so tired I wasn't                           even bothered that people were standing looking into                           my tent through the mosquito net. It was actually quite                           cozy to lie there and listen to the whole family talking,             singing, and getting ready for bed.You get filthy after                           a day of riding on a motorcycle through the bush. My                           once white MSF t-shirt is always brown and my body                           covered in a layer of dust. In one place they gave                           me bucket of cold water and I found a spot to take                           a shower. It was a bit out in the open, but nice to             be outside in the moonlight.The noise always wakes                           me up early. It almost seems prohibited to sleep after                           half-past five here. The sounds and the light of the                           jungle grow stronger and stronger. It is as if the             whole jungle wakes up at the very same time.Some villages                           are deep in the forest, only accessible after an entire                           day by canoe. No one seems to know how many people                           are staying in all the different villages along the                           rivers, since they are a moving population. This could                           potentially be a very difficult to try to reach all                           these villages and maintain the cold chain with only                           ice packs and cool boxes for the vaccines, which have             to be kept between 2 and 8Â°Celcius.Back at Basankusu town, we have to organize the     data collected during the 5-day exploration. Not easy since we have a lot   of contradicting information. The health authorities here have some                               data on the map that I jotted down before we headed                               out. But now we have done the long journey, it   turns out that they have different data in their files.     Plus, it is always difficult to get the information out of             the villagers when visiting the health posts.But       the map has improved. We have changed a lot of things from                                 our original as well as the information we started                                 out with. In the end we just decided to trust   what we had seen during the exploratory mission. Over       the next days we will sit from morning to evening to organize                                 the information. My evenings are spent putting     everything in Excel files.I spent some hours comparing different                                 maps and then drawing my own with the correct   distances on it. We have started to make lists of all the     villages. There are hundreds of them. We will use this when       we start drawing up all the different teams and how we             will organize the stock and preparation sites.Karl,     a logistician on the campaign, and I need to go to Mbankdaka to prepare all     the things that have arrived from Lukuto. It takes two days. On the way back       we will probably go together with our vaccination materials                                   (fridges, cool boxes, generators, gasoline).     If we do this, we will be able to see that everything is                                   put on the canoe and we will also be the ones     to unload it.We just received word that the canoe going from                                   Mbandaka to Basankusu and Djolo has tipped   over and all the things sunk. They tried to get the military                                   and the villagers to help out to retrieve everything.                                   For the hospital here this means that all their       medical supplies have probably been destroyed. Maybe it is                                   possible to save some of the medical supplies,       but most likely not.The plan for the moment is to start                                   the campaign in two or three weeks. We will   divide it in three zones and cover each one in about     10             days.The last zone to the north we will probably       not be able to visit beforehand. It is smaller than the one we visited   in this exploratory mission and the only way to get there is by canoe.                                     This will consume a lot of fuel so, for the       moment, it is not possible.We've finally made it back to the     main MSF base in Mbandaka to work on the information sessions for the 147   vaccination teams and the planning for the medical materials we will need                                         for this vaccination effort. We had started           to head back from Basankusu yesterday, at 5:30am,                                         when the sun was rising and we hoped   to make it here before it set. Unfortunately, that didn't                                         quite happen. We didn't arrive at the   port here until after dark, having spent the full day travelling,                                         under the merciless sun, down the Ikilemba,           one of the little tributaries of the larger Congo           river.We had gotten up so early that we didn't have any                                         breakfast before leaving. Instead I bought           12 bananas and planned to buy bread on the market before heading                                         off. In the end we didn't have time to     get the bread and I left all the bananas on the kitchen                                         tableâ€”so             much for my plans.After searching my                                         bag for something edible (13 hours without                                         any food is a lot) I found some chewing                                         gum. We had just one each for breakfast,                                         saving the rest for lunch and dinner.                                         Fortunately, mid-afternoon we did a 10-minute                                         stop with the pirogue at an old Catholic                                         mission station in the middle of the             jungle.This little mission station is                                         little more than a small village with                                         a big church in the centre. However it                                         is a very important toilet opportunity                                         and not to be missed since we could only                                         make one stop during the whole day. Initially                                         I had thought it would be possible to                                         just stop anywhereâ€”after                                         all this is a jungle. But you cannot,                                         since the rain forest is so dense that                                         it is impossible to get into it. Instead,                                         every stop has to be well planned. Oh                                         well. We managed to buy some bananas                                         and bread at the mission station so we             could finally eat something.Each vaccination                                         team will be made up of five people.                                         We have made lists of how many teams                                         are needed and we are still trying to                                         decide where we place the site to stock                                         the vaccines and where to keep the preparation             sites.There will be 100,000 vaccination                                         vials used in this effort and keeping                                         the vials healthy is essential. For this                                         we need to create a 'cold chain', where                                         the vaccinations are constantly kept                                         at low temperatures before use. If the                                         cold chain breaks, the vaccinations will             be useless.The preparation site is the     heart of the cold chain (needed to constantly keep the vaccines between 2Â° and     8Â°C) and                                           that site is then used to supply all             the stock sites.That is where we will       keep the generators used for running the refrigerators, a kin to a spider       in the middle of his web. At the stock sites we keep the vaccines                                             in large cool boxes and go back and       forth from there to the preparation site to                                             supply the stock site with cold ice       packs. It all needs to be meticulously planned,                                             or at least as meticulously as the       realities of Basankusu allow.When the vaccination                                               campaign starts, we will have split         the area in three different pools. Pool One                                               is Waka, situated southeast of   Basankusu. Pool Two is Bokakata to the south     and finally Djombo, Pool Three, is to the                                               northeast. The easiest will be   Waka, so we have decided to start with     that. The last pool, Djombo, is going to         be the toughest since we have to transport                                               everything by river and set everything             up from one preparation site.To       complicate the matter, two thirds of the people                                                 in Djombo live in the bush and     so are only accessible by foot or canoe. The                                                 third that will be reached by   motorcycle seems to be easier, although we     have had reports that some stretches of           the road are in miserable condition and it                                                 will be horribly difficult to   come through with the heavy cool boxes on the back             of the motorcycles.Plus we have         not had the chance to visit the area. This                                                   is not ideal although, with   the help of some people from the area, we         have managed to complete the very inaccurate                                                   map. There is page after page     of information on all the health centres and the villages.                                                   And all of this has to be prepared             for the report due in Kinshasa by the end                                                   of the week.
