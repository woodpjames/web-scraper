Doctors Without Borders Reports at Union World Conference on Lung Health on Use of New TB Drugs

Oct 26 16
Kalemie, in the east of the country, is exposed to cholera throughout the year. To combat the disease, Doctors Without Borders/Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) provides an integrated package including immunization, medical treatment and clean water supply. Cholera thrives in areas with poor quality water and inadequate sanitation. Aware that the solution is to tackle the issue of water supply, the MSF teams who have been treating the disease in Kalemie since 2010 have partnered with the authorities and other aid agencies to repair the supply network.
