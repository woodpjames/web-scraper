Apr 27 18
Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) began working in Likoni, Kenya, in February 2016, collaborating with the Mombasa County Department of Health. While MSF renovates and upgrades the brick and mortar maternity hospital in Likoni, staff provide life-saving care for mothers and babies inside a temporary shipping container structure—the Mrima Health Center.
