Inside Yemen: 5 Days in an emergency hospital

Feb 5 19
As we start the new year, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) looks forward to new opportunities to ensure affordable access to medical innovation for everyone. The MSF Access Campaign is pushing for our teams to have the tools they need to provide the best medical care for people served by our projects around the world and to help pave the way for wider access to medicines, vaccines, and tests.When MSF received the Nobel Peace Prize back in 1999, our international president Dr. James Orbinski called for "change not charity." We used the prize to set up the MSF Access Campaign to help make lifesaving medicines accessible to all people in need, regardless of where they live.This wish list highlights some of the Access Campaign's top priorities for 2019, and also celebrates a milestone achievement.
