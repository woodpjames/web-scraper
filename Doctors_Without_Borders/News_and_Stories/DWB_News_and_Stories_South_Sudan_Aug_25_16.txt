South Sudan: Access to Medical Care Dramatically Reduced Due to Violence

Aug 25 16
Since early December 2013, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has provided medical care to more than 1,000 patients wounded by violence in and around Bangui airport, where approximately 100,000 displaced people have taken refuge from a wave of fighting that has spread across the country. Carrying out medical activities at the camp is a big challenge due to heavy fighting that regularly takes place close to where MSF is working.
