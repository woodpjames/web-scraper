In Tegucigalpa, the capital of Honduras, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is providing medical assistance to vulnerable people facing extreme violence and a lack of access to health care. Many of these patients are young people who live on the streets and suffer the most from what MSF staff call an "epidemic of violence". Photographs and voiceover by Spencer Platt.
