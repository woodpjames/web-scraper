This month, we visit the Ubangi river, where MSF is treating yaws among the Pygmy population; Niger, where the rainy season and food insecurity have exacerbated malaria and malnutrition; and Sri Lanka, where after 32 years MSF is handing over its last remaining project and leaving the country. Additionally, learn about the court case Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis has brought against India, the "pharmacy of the developing world."
