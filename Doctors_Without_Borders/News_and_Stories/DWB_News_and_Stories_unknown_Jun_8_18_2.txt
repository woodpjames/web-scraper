Eugene is one of more than 430 people from over 40 countries treated by the Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) project Victims of Torture in Athens since it opened in 2014. Eugene survived torture when his community in Nigeria found out that he was gay. He is now living in Athens, where he attends the MSF clinic for support, and immerses himself in his new life in Greece.
