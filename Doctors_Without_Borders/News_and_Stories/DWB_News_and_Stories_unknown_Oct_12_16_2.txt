Doctors Without Borders Statement on WHO Global TB Report

Oct 12 16
In March 2013 a coup d'Ã©tat in the Central African Republic by Muslim fighters called the Seleka plunged the country into conflict, and Christian militia named the anti-Balaka soon formed. Caught up in the crossfire are civilians, who face extreme violence, displacement, dire living conditions and a critical lack of access to medical care. So far this year Doctors Without Borders/Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) staff have carried out 315,600 outpatient consultations, and treated more than 3,250 patients with violence related wounds.
