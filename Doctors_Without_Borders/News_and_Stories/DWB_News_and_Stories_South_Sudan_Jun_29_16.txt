South Sudan: Fighting in Wau Displaces Thousands 

Jun 29 16
In the mountainous region of Nagaland, northeast India, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is working with local groups and health authorities to treat people with drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB), a form of the disease that does not respond to the two main drugs used to treat TB. The two-year regimen for treating DR-TB is extremely arduous and can cause patients to become blind or deaf and can cause organ failure. MSF is calling for better diagnosis and treatment for DR-TB.
