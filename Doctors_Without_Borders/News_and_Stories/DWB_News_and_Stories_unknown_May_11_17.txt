Report: Forced to Flee Central America's Northern Triangle

May 11 17
Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) teams have begun running mobile medical clinics by helicopter to remote villages in the mountains to the north of Kathmandu. Many villages have been completely or partially destroyed and people are living under makeshift shelters. The earthquake and subsequent avalanches have cut off access to many villages so people are stuck with no way out.
