MSF responds to Indonesia tsunami disaster

Dec 23 18
Doctors Without Borders is excited to join forces with YouTube, which has just launched new tools for creators to raise money on behalf of great causes. Thanks to a generous gift from Kent and Mary Taylor, donations made via YouTube will be matched dollar-for-dollar, up to $100,000! We hope this initiative makes it easier for people to engage with us, share our videos, and support our work.Check out our YouTube channel and watch the story of Dr. Innocent Kunyuwana, who grew up in a rural area of Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and dreamed of becoming a doctor. He is now the first Congolese physician to lead MSF's emergency team in volatile South Kivu province.
