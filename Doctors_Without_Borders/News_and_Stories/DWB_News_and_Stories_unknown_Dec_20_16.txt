"Last week, we arrived at one village where we had 40 patients in just that village alone. It's unbelievable." The number of Ebola victims continues to increase in West Africa. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) continues to treat and try to prevent new cases from occurring, but staff are overwhelmed. There have now been 603 deaths and a total of 964 cases. The World Health Organization (WHO) announced on July 15 that 68 new deaths were reported between July 8 and 12 in the three countries—Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia—where the virus is raging.
