A Girl from Aleppo: Four Years, 20 Operations, and the Damage Done

Nov 7 16
Nearly every hour, one woman in Pakistan dies from complications during birth. In Balochistan Province, the rate is even higher than the rest of the country. Here, one-third of women marry before the age of 15, and two-thirds of them are illiterate. This, along with poverty and the distance from clinics, contributes to the high maternal mortality rate, leaving women to make important prenatal decisions without the power to do so.Only three out of ten pregnant women deliver their babies with skilled health workers there to assist them. To combat this issue, Doctors Without Borders/ Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) provides comprehensive emergency obstetric care, neonatal nursery, pediatric and gynecological inpatient care, emergency referrals, and nutrition services.
