Doctors of Aleppo: "We Are Under Siege"

A survey in 2012 showed that one person in every four was HIV-positive in Ndhiwa. The epidemic continues to spread as every year sees two in 100 people becoming infected with the AIDS virus. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF)'s program aims to reduce transmission of the virus and the mortality rate of people living with AIDS. The testing campaign will target pregnant women in particular, as treating HIV-positive women reduces the risk of transmitting the virus to their newborn babies.
