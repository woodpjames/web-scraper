Iraq’s health care system was already severely affected by years of sanctions and conflict, but needs have increased dramatically as of late. Two years into Iraq's civil conflict, the country is hosting 3.4 million internally displaced people (IDPs), with no end to the conflict in sight. Iraqis are being forced to flee their homes as a result of fighting that has ravaged the country’s central provinces and is gearing up to move north to Mosul.Doctors Without Borders'/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has been steadily increasing its response in Iraq, with teams of both Iraqi and international staff working in a growing number of locations across 11 governorates to provide free basic health care, mental health services, and essential relief items to displaced families, returnees, impoverished host communities and Syrian refugees.
