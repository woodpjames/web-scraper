Yemen: Cholera Outbreak Threatens to Spiral Out of Control

May 20 17
Saturday, May 23, is the International Day to End Obstetric Fistulas. Every year, an estimated 50,000 to 100,000 women and girls develop a fistula. Though not immediately life-threatening, fistulas come with devastating health and social consequences. Our health care teams provide emergency obstetric care to prevent the occurrence of fistulas, while providing repair surgery to those with the condition in some areas.Read more about MSF's work on obstetric fistulas and other women's health issues at http://womenshealth.msf.org/.
