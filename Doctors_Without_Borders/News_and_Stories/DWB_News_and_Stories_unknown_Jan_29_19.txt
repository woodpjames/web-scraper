Ebola outbreak in DRC: Crisis update

Jan 29 19
A little-known exodus has been taking place for more than a year in western Africa as tens of thousands of people flee the English-speaking regions of Cameroon to seek refuge in southern Nigeria’s Cross River State. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has launched an emergency response to provide aid to both the refugees and the communities hosting them.Political disputes in Cameroon’s Southwest and Northwest regions escalated in late 2016. After secessionist armed forces proclaimed an independent state, they were confronted by the National Army. Since then, daily violence has forced thousands to flee their villages to seek refuge and protection in neighboring Nigeria. Despite concerns over the escalating violence, there has been very little aid response by the international community either inside Cameroon, where access for humanitarian groups is severely limited, or in Nigeria.By the end of November 2018, an estimated 437,000 people were internally displaced within the Southwest and Northwest regions of Cameroon. Most have fled into the bush, where living conditions are poor and there is a lack of adequate shelter and access to food, water, and basic health services. To help meet the medical and health needs of these displaced populations, MSF is strengthening the referral and emergency systems of district health structures in Buea (Southwest Region) and Bamenda (Northwest Region) and developing the capacity of community health workers to provide decentralized care. MSF is concentrating its activities on rural and peripheral areas where peaks of violence prevent large numbers of people from accessing health services.
