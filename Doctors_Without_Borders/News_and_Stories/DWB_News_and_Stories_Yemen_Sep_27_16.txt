Yemen: Detailed Documentation of Two Attacks on MSF Medical Facilities

Sep 27 16
The conflict that erupted at the beginning of December has forced a million people to leave their homes. There are already 55,000 refugees registered in camps around the country, and there are hundreds of new arrivals every day. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) works in a transit camp and in three permanent camps managing water supply and delivering medical treatment. The organization has also opened a hospital and maternity unit and provides treatment to malnourished children close to the camps in Dzaipi.
