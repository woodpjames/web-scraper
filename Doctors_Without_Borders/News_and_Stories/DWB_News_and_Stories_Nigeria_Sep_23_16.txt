Crisis in Nigeria's Borno State: "We Fled to Survive"

The Malakal Teaching Hospital in South Sudan, where Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) had been working, was attacked by armed men in February. The MSF team was forced to temporarily suspend its activities due to the violence. When they were able to return to the hospital five days later, they found a horrifying scene. "There were 11 dead bodies in the hospital – patients murdered in their beds,” says Carlos Francisco, MSF field coordinator in Malakal. “We found three more bodies near one of the hospital gates."
