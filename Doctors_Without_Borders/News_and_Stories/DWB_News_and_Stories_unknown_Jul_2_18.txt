Jul 2 18
As part of the 2017 Photoville exhibition, September 13 through 24 at Brooklyn Bridge Plaza in New York, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) presents a series of portraits of people forced from home in search of safety. Many of these displaced people bear physical and psychological wounds from the dangerous journey, and are exposed to additional threats as countries close their borders and deny them protection.While the debates around global refugee policy can seem abstract, the impact on human lives is immediate and often devastating.The exhibition, "We Have Experienced Calamities," provides a glimpse of the challenges faced by more than 65 million displaced people around the world. These people need protection and access to urgent medical care.Photoville is free and open to the public. Learn more here.
