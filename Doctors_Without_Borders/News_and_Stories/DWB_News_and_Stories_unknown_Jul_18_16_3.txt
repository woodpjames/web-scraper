An attack on the town of Bouca, northern Central African Republic (CAR), on September 9, 2013, spurred yet another wave of displaced people in the country. A military campaign by an alliance of rebel forces, Séléka, took a number of major towns and territory in eastern and central regions of CAR in 2012 and the fighting between armed groups has continued through 2013. An estimated 400,000 people are currently displaced in CAR.
