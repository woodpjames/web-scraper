MSF has been assisting victims of the conflict in Sudan's Darfur region since late 2003. In this slideshow, an MSF team works in Kutrum, nestled inside the rebel-held Jebel Marra mountains. While another team is working in the displaced-persons camps in Zalengei, West Darfur state. An emergency team is also responding to the water and sanitation needs of a nomadic community affected by fighting in South Darfur state.
