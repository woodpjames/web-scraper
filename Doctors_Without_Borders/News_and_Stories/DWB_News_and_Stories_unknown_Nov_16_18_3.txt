Nov 16 18
At projects around the world, MSF teams are working to meet the health needs of women and girls forced from home. Margaret Bell, a registered nurse, midwife, and women‘s health advisor for MSF, describes some of the challenges they face.One of the first babies born at an MSF clinic this year was a little boy at a Rohingya refugee camp in Bangladesh. Our medical staff found that his mother, Raheema, was suffering from preeclampsia, a life-threatening complication that can develop during pregnancy. Fortunately, they were able to provide her with emergency care and helped her to safely deliver a new life on New Year’s Day.
