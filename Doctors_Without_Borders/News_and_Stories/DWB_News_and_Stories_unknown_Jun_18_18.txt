Malnutrition Deeply: Undernutrition is a Community Health Issue

Jun 18 18
At a time when life-saving antiretrovirals are more widely available than ever, an unacceptably high number of people are still dying of AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa. The main causes of illness and death are treatment failure, interruption, or delays.These portraits of HIV/AIDS patients at hospitals supported by Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) in  Kenya,  Malawi  and 
Democratic Republic of Congo  illustrate some of the challenges people face in pursuing effective treatment. Surviving advanced HIV is possible: it requires quick action and investments at the community level and in primary and hospital care.Upon the release today of a new briefing paper at the International AIDS Society Conference on HIV Science in Paris, MSF is calling for the urgent implementation of new World Health Organization guidelines to treat AIDS in low-resource settings, with additional measures to address potential drug resistance and treatment failure.
