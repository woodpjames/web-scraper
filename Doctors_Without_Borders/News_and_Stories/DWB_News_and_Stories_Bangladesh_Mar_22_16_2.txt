Bangladesh: A Remarkable Reduction in Maternal Mortality

Mar 22 16
Hurricane Sandy hit Haiti in late October, bringing with it a rise in cholera cases. Even though the Ministry of Health's response to cholera remains inadequate, many aid organizations are leaving the country. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) runs five cholera treatment centers to respond to the epidemic and teams have increased the number of beds in order to deal with the influx of patients. At the treatment centers, patients receive oral or intravenous rehydration and the most severe cases receive antibiotics.
