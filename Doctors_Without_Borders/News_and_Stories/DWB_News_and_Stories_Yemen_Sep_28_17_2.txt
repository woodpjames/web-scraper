Yemen: Government Health Staff are Saving Lives Without Salaries in War-Torn Country

Sep 28 17
Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) launched an emergency malaria intervention in North Kivu, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), after unprecedented numbers of sick people were reported in October. The MSF teams have been running mobile clinics in at least five villages each week, and supporting two health centers. They see up to 500 patients a day.

	Situated deep in remote forests, the villages of Remeka and Katunda are very difficult to access by road and for parts of the journey everything—personnel, supplies, medicines—must be transported on foot or on motorbikes.
