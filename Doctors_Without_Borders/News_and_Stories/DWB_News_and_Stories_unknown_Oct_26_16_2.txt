On January 2nd, 2014, five members of Doctors Without Borders/Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) were abducted in northern Syria and held captive by an armed group for several months. Almost no aid reaches zones that are not under Syrian army control. MSF's medical facilities are faced with deteriorating security conditions.
