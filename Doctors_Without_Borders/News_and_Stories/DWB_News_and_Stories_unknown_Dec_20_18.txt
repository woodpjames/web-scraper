Central American migration: "I want a normal life for my son"

Dec 20 18
Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) regional advocacy manager Samuel Almeida is part of the team responding to the humanitarian crisis unfolding across the Northern Triangle of Central America and Mexico. Currently based in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, Almeida explains what’s driving the spike in forced displacement and migration across the region and what more can be done to help people at risk.What is MSF doing in Honduras?MSF has been in Honduras for more than 40 years now—we started in 1974 and we’ve been in the country for many different emergencies and crises. Currently we work with victims of violence, including sexual violence, in Tegucigalpa. In Choloma and San Pedro Sula we focus more on sexual and reproductive health care, and we run a maternity ward with the Honduran Department of Health. We also work at a clinic, doing mental health care and health education outreach with the community. Recently, we have started to work with returnees deported from the United States.Why are Hondurans fleeing their homes?In Honduras, economic issues and violence go hand in hand. Criminal violence affects everything—many people normalize it, so when they tell us they’re leaving home for economic reasons, that lack of opportunity could also be because of the violence.
