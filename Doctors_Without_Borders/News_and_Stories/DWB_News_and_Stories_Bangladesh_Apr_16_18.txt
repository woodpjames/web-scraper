Aqila is the 29-year-old Afghan midwife supervisor at the Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF)  hospital in Dasht-e-Barchi in Kabul, Afghanistan. "I’ve seen a lot of women in my life dying during delivery or after delivery because of PPH (post-partum haemorrhage) or a complication of delivery. And I’ve seen children growing without their mother. It’s really a very sad thing for me. And I decided in the future to become a midwife and now since 10 years I’m working as a midwife and I’m really happy about this."
