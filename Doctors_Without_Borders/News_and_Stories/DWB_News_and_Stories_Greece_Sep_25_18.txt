New York Times: Greece’s Biggest Migrant Camp is a Mental Health Crisis, Aid Groups Say

Sep 25 18
More than 100,000 people have been forced from their homes in Ituri province, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), as a result of violence involving the Lendu and Hema communities. Since the resurgence of violence in Ituri began in December 2017 and intensified in February, many people have fled to other parts of DRC, north towards Mahagi, or south towards Bunia, while tens of thousands of others have crossed Lake Albert seeking safety in Uganda. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) teams are working in both DRC and Uganda to help people displaced by the attacks.In DRC, many people are living on informal camp sites or with host families, or sheltering in churches and schools. Some have been surviving in these conditions for over a month now and there is a very real risk that their health could soon start to deteriorate, resulting in cases of severe malnutrition, or a measles or cholera epidemic.
