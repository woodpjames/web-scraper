Growing innovations: MSF’s sapling nursery

Apr 6 18
In Kasese, Uganda, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) runs a recreation center for adolescents. The kids come to play games and make crafts and they also get to know the MSF health staff who give short talks on topics including HIV. Many of the kids who have come to the center have eventually gotten tested for HIV at the adjacent MSF health clinic, and several of those are now receiving treatment.Adolescents are the most vulnerable group of HIV patients for a number of reasons, and they require specific care. As an example, MSF social worker Kathy MacLaughlin tells the story of Timmy, who was 13 years old and HIV-positive.
