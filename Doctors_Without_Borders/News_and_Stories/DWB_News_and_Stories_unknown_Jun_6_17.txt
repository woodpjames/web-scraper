Medical Care in Mosul: “There are No Heroes in This Story, Only Victims”

Jun 6 17
The humanitarian crisis in Yemen grows more catastrophic each day. Fighting and indiscriminate airstrikes have harmed civilians, medical facilities, and critical infrastructure, disabling the only international airport in the country. These attacks, along with an unwavering blockade, have crippled Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières's (MSF's) ability to access people who are in dire need of care, as it is nearly impossible to get supplies and aid workers into the country. Fuel is all but unavailable, making it increasingly difficult for Yemenis to seek medical care, or even access clean drinking water. Since fighting broke out, more than 1,500 people have been killed, and MSF has treated more than 1,600 wounded by the fighting and bombings.
