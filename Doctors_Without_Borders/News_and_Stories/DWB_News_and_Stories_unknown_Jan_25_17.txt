Safe Abortions: An Integral Part of Health Care Services for Women

Jan 25 17
Three years of war, 190,000 dead, three million refugees. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is witness to the human suffering behind the statistics. The war leaves its mark beyond Syria, in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and Iraq, as physical and psychological wounds scar its refugees. MSF teams deliver medical services to Syrian refugees in these bordering countries. See the Reach of War: http://reachofwar.msf.org/
