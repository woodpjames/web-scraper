Arunn Jegan recently returned from his second assignment in Taiz, Yemen, where he was working with Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) as a project coordinator. Here, he describes the situation in Taiz, a city that has been wracked by fighting between armed groups since 2015.Senseless violence, lawlessness, resilient people tired of conflict ... these were my impressions of Yemen before I arrived. It was visceral. And then there was Taiz city, the last bastion of hope for peace.Taiz, the third largest city in Yemen, is separated by a frontline. Yemenis are exposed to violence on a daily basis, and the constant sound of shelling and gunfire crackling through the days and blaring through the nights has become the norm. I remember at one point in January this year, when we were hearing five explosions every minute for a period of two weeks.Today, the main issue for people in Taiz is still insecurity. Day-to-day, there’s the fear of being killed by stray gunfire or shelling in the city.
