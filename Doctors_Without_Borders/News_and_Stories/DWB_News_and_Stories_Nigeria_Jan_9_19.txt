William Hennequin, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) program manager for Libya, wrote an open letter today to Ghassan Salamé, special representative and head of the United Nations support mission in Libya, raising concerns about the forced return of migrants to Libya. The letter provides a detailed account of MSF’s experience treating refugees and migrants forcibly disembarked from the merchant ship Nivin by Libyan authorities in Misrata on November 20.The letter calls on the UN to do more to protect refugees and migrants trapped in Libya, while scaling up existing evacuation mechanisms outside the country.
