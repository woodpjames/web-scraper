Helping Women Survive in Central African Republic

Mar 29 18
No access to health care, except for those that are being provided by aid agencies. Very difficult to find clean drinking water. Prolonged years now of failed harvests, leading to increased food insecurity. And then of course, just the never-ending feeling that violence could rip apart your life and the life of your family.Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has worked in the region that today constitutes the Republic of South Sudan since 1983. Today, we employ more than 3,000 South Sudanese staff and 330 international staff to respond to a wide range of medical emergencies and provide free and high quality health care to people in need in 17 project locations across seven of South Sudan's 10 states and the Abyei Special Administrative Area.
