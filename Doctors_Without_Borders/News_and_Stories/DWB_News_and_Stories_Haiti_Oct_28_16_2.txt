Hurricane Response in Haiti: "There is Still Much Work to Be Done"

Oct 28 16
There are still 50,000 refugees living in M'Poko camp at Bangui airport in Central African Republic. The authorities want them to go home but this is quite simply not an option for those who sought refuge at Bangui airport five months ago. Although life here is tough, the continuing violence in some parts of Bangui means it's still far too dangerous to go back to the city. The MSF teams have provided 90,000 consultations in this camp since the beginning of the year; a third were related to malaria.
