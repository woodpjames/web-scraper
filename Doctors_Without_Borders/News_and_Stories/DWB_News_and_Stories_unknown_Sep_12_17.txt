DRC: After 10 years, MSF Is Still Needed in Masisi

Sep 12 17
Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is working in "the Jungle" makeshift camp in Calais, France, where some 6,000 people are sheltering after making the dangerous journey from Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq, Sudan or Eritrea. "We have a large team working on waste management, both raising awareness and collecting rubbish because rubbish has been accumulating for weeks and weeks, months even. We’re also working on providing shelters," said head of mission Pauline Busson.
