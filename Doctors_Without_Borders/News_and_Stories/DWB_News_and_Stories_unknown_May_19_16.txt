CAR: MSF Condemns Violent Attack and Killing of Staff Member

For more than a year, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has been providing medical assistance to neglected populations, particularly drug addicts, prostitutes, and street children, in Tehran’s Darvazeh Ghar neighborhood. Though they share the streets with merchants and vendors during the day, they can rarely access medical care as easily as most others in Iran's capital, despite significant health care needs.
