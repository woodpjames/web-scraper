This center served   as a base for us to refer the most urgent cases identified during our time   running mobile clinics in the area. We also supported a primary health care   center in the village of Chansolme. Since we initiated this support, the number   of consultation has tripled at the center. It should be noted that we provided   assistance and medicines free of charge. This makes a huge difference for people   since most Haitians cannot afford the 10 gourdes (approximately $0.25) that   consultations usually cost.
