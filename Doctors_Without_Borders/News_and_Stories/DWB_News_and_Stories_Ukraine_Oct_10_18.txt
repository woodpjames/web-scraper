Living with trauma amid conflict in eastern Ukraine

Oct 10 18
The old town area of Mosul, in Iraq, experienced intense shelling, aerial bombing, and attacks with explosive devices during the most recent violence. Though much of the area is still in ruins, thousands of people have returned to their homes. MSF has responded by distributing 550 hygiene kits with items including soap, toothbrushes, shampoo, and water containers.
