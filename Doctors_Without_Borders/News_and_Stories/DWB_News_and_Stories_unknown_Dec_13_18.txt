This page was updated on October 29, 2018As the Ebola outbreak in northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) continues, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is responding on multiple fronts to treat patients and protect health workers. The outbreak likely began in May but wasn’t declared until August 1 after a case was reported in Mangina, North Kivu. As of October 27, the number of Ebola cases has reached 267 (232 confirmed). Of these, 170 people have died (135 of which were confirmed cases), indicating that the outbreak is far from over.The epidemiological situation is worrisome. So far, health officials in North Kivu and Ituri provinces—including Mandima, Mabalako, Beni, Oicha, Butembo, Kalunguta, Komanda, Masareka, Musienene, and Tchomia—have reported confirmed or probable cases of Ebola. The epicenter has now moved from the small village of Mangina to the much bigger city of Beni, where the number of confirmed cases has shown a clear increase throughout October. MSF is particularly concerned about the scattered pattern of the outbreak and the fact it has now spread to larger cities. Worryingly, cases have also been confirmed in Tchomia, near the Ugandan border.While more than 8,000 contacts have been identified and more than 2,732 are being followed up by the Congolese Ministry of Health (MoH), epidemiological teams are still working to identify all active chains of transmission.
