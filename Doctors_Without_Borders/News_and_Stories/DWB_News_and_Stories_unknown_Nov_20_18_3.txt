Around 17 million people in the Lake Chad region live in areas affected by violent conflict between non-state armed groups and military forces. Across Cameroon, Chad, Niger, and Nigeria, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has witnessed an increasing need for mental health support for those living amid the violence, as well as the 2.3 million people forced to flee their homes.An important part of MSF activities in this region is aimed at reducing psychological suffering for people caught in the conflict. Many are in need of psychological support, having experienced violence, witnessed atrocities, or lost family members and belongings.Even in places where violence may have decreased, the consequences of displacement, hopelessness, and despair continue to affect people’s lives and can lead to chronic mental health problems.
