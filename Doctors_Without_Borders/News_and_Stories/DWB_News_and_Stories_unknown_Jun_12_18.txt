Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) began supporting Abs Hospital in northern Yemen in July 2015. A year later, an airstrike by the Saudi-led coalition destroyed part of the complex, killing 19 people, including one MSF staff member, and wounding 24 others. After rebuilding the hospital in November 2016, MSF resumed medical services.Currently, the MSF team runs a treatment center in response to the ongoing cholera outbreak in Yemen, which is spreading due to poor sanitation, a lack of safe drinking water, a devastated health care system, and the ongoing conflict. About 200 Yemeni staff and a dozen international staff work in Abs Hospital. MSF also runs emergency services, a pediatric unit, a maternity ward, a nutrition center, a mobile clinic service, and psychosocial counseling sessions serving the local community and large numbers of displaced people in the area around Abs.
