A cholera epidemic is rapidly spreading along the Congo River in western Democratic Republic of Congo. The disease is affecting towns and villages along the waterway, which is the population's main mode of transportation. More than 250 people had died as a result of the disease by July 21, and the epidemic is expected to soon reach the country's crowded capital, Kinshasa.Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) emergency medical teams are running a free cholera treatment center (CTC) in the city of Mbandaka that has been receiving around 20 new patients a day.Photos by Robin Meldrum/MSF
