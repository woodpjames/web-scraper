CNN's Amanpour: MSF President: U.S. must show it respects 'rules of war'

Oct 14 15
In Mozambique's Tete province, MSF is working with an innovative model for HIV/AIDS treatment that depends on the patients themselves to help facilitate the use of antiretrovial (ARV) drugs. The patients form small groups to support each other, nominating one member to pick up their ARVs and collectively helping each other adhere to the treatment program. This creates a support network for the patients and alleviates strain on Mozambique's under-resourced health system. It also provides a model for scaling up ARV treatment in developing countries with high HIV/AIDS burdens.
