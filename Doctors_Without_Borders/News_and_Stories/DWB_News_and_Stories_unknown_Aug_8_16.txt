Aug 8 16
Typhoon Haiyan struck the Philippines on November 8, 2013, killing more than 5,000 people and displacing more than four million, wiping out homes, hospitals, and infrastructure. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has been providing medical and mental health care, focusing on the most remote parts of the country, for the last three months in inflatable and tented hospitals and through mobile clinics, reaching isolated communities by air, land, and sea.
