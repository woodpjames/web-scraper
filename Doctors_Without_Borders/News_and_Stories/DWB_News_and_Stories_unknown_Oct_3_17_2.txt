Doctors Without Borders Brings Interactive Exhibition on Global Refugee Crisis to Seattle

Oct 3 17
Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) delivered a petition signed by more than 547,000 people to the White House, calling for President Obama to consent to an independent investigation of the deadly U.S. airstrikes on MSF's trauma hospital in Kunduz, Afghanistan. The airstrikes on October 3 killed at least 30 people, including 14 MSF staff members, and destroyed MSF’s hospital. The MSF petition calls for President Obama to consent to an investigation by the International Humanitarian Fact-Finding Commission (IHFFC), the one body established specifically to investigate potential violations of international humanitarian law under the Geneva Conventions.
