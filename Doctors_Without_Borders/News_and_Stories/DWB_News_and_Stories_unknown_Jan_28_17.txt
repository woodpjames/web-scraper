MSF: Suspension of U.S. Refugee Resettlement Endangers People Fleeing War Zones

Jan 28 17
For 50 days, health staff and patients at Gaza’s Al Shifa hospital, where Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has been providing support, lived and worked in a cycle of fighting, ceasefire, and renewed fighting. However, on August 26, an open-ended ceasefire went into effect, bringing a massive sense of relief to health workers and to the population of Gaza as a whole. Though the fighting has ended, activity in the largest hospital in Gaza continues, unabated. MSF surgical teams continue to work alongside staff from the Palestinian Ministry of Health at Al Shifa, as they have been doing since the Israeli army launched Operation Protective Edge on July 8.
