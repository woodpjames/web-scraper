Kerri Ann Kelly is the head of mission for Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) in Nigeria. She explains how the complex humanitarian situation in Borno State, in the northeast of the country, will only get worse with the rainy season and widespread malaria.Seventy-year-old Musa Kime arrived in Rann, a town in Borno State, a few weeks ago. Along with other people from his village, Kime walked 13 miles on foot at night to reach the safety of this small town in northeast Nigeria.  “I just want some food and a place to stay,” says Kime. “I have not much hope.”Others like Kime continue to arrive in towns across the region every day, fleeing the long-running conflict between the Nigerian military and armed groups. According to the United Nations, 1.7 million people have been displaced in northeastern Nigeria, 78 percent of them in Borno State.
