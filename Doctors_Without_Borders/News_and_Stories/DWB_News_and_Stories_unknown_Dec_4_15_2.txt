Mapping the Refugee Crisis

Dec 4 15
New research is showing that there are clear benefits of having HIV patients start antiretroviral treatment before their immune system drops to very low levels. There is less risk of them developing co-infections, such as tuberculosis, and hospitals will receive fewer severely ill patients.

	In this five-part video series, MSF demonstrates tools and models that could help make improved treatment accessible to many more. Between June 8 and 10, 2011, world leaders will meet in New York to decide on the future of the millions needing treatment urgently. By sharing this video, help us spread the word that there is NO EXCUSE for governments to leave 10 million people untreated! See www.doctorswithoutborders.org/stopthevirus for more info.
