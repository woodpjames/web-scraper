South Sudan is set to be officially recognized as an independent nation on July 9, 2011. But hundreds of thousands of newly displaced people in the world’s newest country are facing emergency needs.In May, violence between northern Sudan and South Sudan forces in the contested border region of Abyei pushed some 100,000 people from their homes. Many saw family members killed during heavy bombardments and military ambushes. Some people, terrified of the violence, traveled as far as 10 days from home seeking safety.Photos by Gaël Turine/VU.
