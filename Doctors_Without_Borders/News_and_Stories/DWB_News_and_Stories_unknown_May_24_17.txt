In Aden, in southern Yemen, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is independently running a hospital that is now located in the middle of the fighting. Despite this, medical teams are still receiving and treating injured patients on a daily basis. About 1,000 patients have been treated since the beginning of the clashes on March 19. Movement in Aden has become extremely difficult due to fighting and fuel shortages.
