Our wish list for a happy and healthy new year

Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) humanitarian affairs officer Alex Dunne writes from Yemen, where years of conflict have decimated public health systems and left millions without access to care. A version of this article was originally published in the Irish Independent.Some days, as I get ready to go to work here in Sana’a, I hear the deep drone sound of fighter jets from the Saudi-Emirati Led Coalition (SELC) fly overhead. Since the escalation of the current conflict in 2015, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) medical facilities have been hit by airstrikes several times, with deadly and life-changing consequences for patients, staff, and the communities which depend on the services.MSF staff have also been detained and shot at. An explosive device has been planted in one of our hospitals, and, in perhaps the most egregious attack, armed men entered an MSF-supported hospital and shot at a patient while he was lying on the operating table. Miraculously, he survived.
