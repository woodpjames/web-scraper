On World Aids Day, MSFÂ  launched "Positive Generation: Voices for an AIDS free-future" - a collaborative project based on songs from HIV support groups in Zimbabwe mixed with the voices of international artists who have volunteered their talents and support.

	This project aims to raise awareness about the reality of HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa, which has two sides: people can live highly positive lives with HIV/AIDS treatment, which can also prevent further transmission of the virus; but shortfalls in funding for HIV programs in developing countries threaten the recent progress made in the fight against the virus putting the lives of thousands of people at risk.

	The 'Positive Generation' project includes a CD, book, documentary, and a website. This preview shows how MSF uses music to pass important messages about the virus in Zimbabwe, to explain to patients that they are not alone, that treatment can stabilize the illness, and that the stigma must be broken.
