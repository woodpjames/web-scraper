Yemen: Heavy fighting threatens civilians and health facilities

Nov 21 18
For the past four months, the March of Return demonstrations in Gaza have been met with lethal force by the Israeli army. While protests and casualties have now decreased, the violence is not over—fresh gunshot wounds occur every week. New violence in recent weeks has resulted in the death of one Israeli soldier in mid-July and continuing deaths and injuries among Palestinians.Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has been heavily involved in the emergency response since the beginning with both surgical and post-operative care. The biggest challenge today is treating a massive number of patients with extreme, life-changing injuries that require advanced medical intervention.In the operating room at Friendship Hospital in Gaza City, two MSF doctors, Camille Rodaix and Jan Wynands, struggled with a patient’s shin that had been shattered by a bullet—the bone was shredded and a big chunk of flesh blown away. The plan had been to take some healthy muscle from the calf to help fill the wound. However, once they opened the calf they found the muscle was also damaged: riddled with bits of shrapnel and toughened by areas of scar tissue.“I operated on this patient before to remove a bone fragment that was sticking up into the skin,” said Dr. Rodaix, an orthopedic surgeon. “I will work with Jan—the plastic surgeon—to check for any remaining bits of dead bone and to close the wound.”Though this was not the patient’s first operation, it would also not be his last: the orthopedic surgery necessary to permanently heal the wound is extremely difficult, according to Dr. Rodaix. “We don’t have the tools to do it, and we cannot try to fix the bone while the wound is still open anyway,” she said.
