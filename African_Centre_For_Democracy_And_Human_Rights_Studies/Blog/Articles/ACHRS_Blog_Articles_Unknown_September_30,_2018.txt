The UN theme this year is celebrating older human rights champions, marking the 70th Anniversary of the Declaration on Human Rights. For us, it is about recognising the lives and work of older campaigners globally, and moving toward a convention on the rights of older people.Over the summer, HelpAge have collected and translated a series of moving and inspiring personal ‘untold stories’ of campaigners from 20 countries, and this week, published them on a dedicated ‘photo-wall’ on our website.We believe these stories testify to the incredible achievements older campaigners have made, as well as the challenges that they – and we as a global community - still face.Although older campaigners have made great strides, their everyday experiences of age discrimination are evidence that we need a legally binding UN convention on the rights of older people, and we are continuing to advocate and campaign for this.Please feel free to use these stories, for example at events you are organising or speaking at, in a speech, blog or article you may be writing, or sharing through your own social media channels.Follow us on Social Media:Face book: https://www.facebook.com/ACDHRSTwitter: https://twitter.com/acdhrsorgYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOs0PVfNXcbD5uSEA2GZrCQFor further information or clarifications, please contact:John Gbenagnon, Communication and Information Officer, Email: communications@acdhrs.org; WhatsApp: +220 7237273The African Centre for Democracy and Human Rights Studies (ACDHRS)Website: www.acdhrs.orgEmail: admin@acdhrs.orgZoe Tembo Building Kerr Serign,
