UNGA73: The African Centre and its Partners urge the UN Human Rights Council not to engage in vote trading or privileging political considerations over fundamental human rights.To the Permanent Representatives of Member States of the UN General AssemblyExcellencies,Ahead of the next UN Human Rights Council (“HRC” or “the Coun­cil”) election, we, the undersigned national, regional, and international civil society organisations, write to urge your delegation to refrain from voting for candidates that blatantly fail to fulfil the Council membership standards outlined in UN General Assembly (UNGA) resolution 60/251.Paragraphs 8 and 9 of resolution 60/251 state that the UNGA:We are concerned that several of the States that are running for election fail to fulfil minimal 
requi­re­ments with regard to both the pro­motion and pro­tection of human rights and cooperation with the Council and other UN human rights bodies and mech­anisms. Some of these candidates show a pattern of non-cooperation with the UN human rights system and attacks against UN Special Procedure Man­date-Holders that is in­compatible with Council membership. Furthermore, some of this year’s candi­da­tes have engaged in acts of in­ti­midation and repri­sals against human rights defenders and civil society organisations, who play a key role in the Council’s work. Voting for these can­didates would undermine the Council’s credibility and institutional integrity.We urge you to treat human rights considerations and the substantive Council membership criteria out­lined in resolution 60/251 as paramount in electing members to the Council, rather than engaging in vote trading or privileging political considerations over fundamental human rights.In October 2018, the next HRC election will determine which States sit as Members of the Council in the next three years (2019-2021). Considering that States must receive a simple majority of votes (i.e., 97) to be elected, that voting takes place by secret ballot, and that electing States are under no obligation to vote for each and every can­didate within a regional group, we urge your dele­gation to simply refrain from voting for unfit candidates. Doing so will require leaving the ballot blank for those candidate States your delegation considers unfit.Sincerely,African Centre for Democracy and Human Rights Studies (ACDHRS)African Centre for Justice and Peace Studies (ACJPS)Americans for Democracy & Human Rights in Bahrain (ADHRB)ARTICLE 19Asian Forum for Human Rights and Development (FORUM-ASIA)Asian Legal Resource Centre (ALRC)Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy (BIRD)Cairo Institute for Human Rights StudiesCentro de Estudios Legales y Sociales (CELS)CIVICUS: World Alliance for Citizen Participation
