Mrs. Hannah Forster, Director, African Centre for Democracy and Human Rights Studies (ACDHRS) , pointed out that the potential and significance of the Protocol goes beyond the African continent. While complementing the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights in ensuring greater respect for observance of the human rights of women in Africa, it addresses gaps in the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination against Women, and underlines the need to put in place effective policies and other measures to back up legislation. Commendation is, therefore, due to the 41 states that have ratified. We urge them to domesticate and implement the Protocol, especially the acceleration of legislative reforms to enhance policies and programmes to this end.

Without universal ratification, domestication, implementation and enforcement of this important document for the attainment of the human rights of women, not much progress would be achieved to address the dismal and discriminatory experiences of women in all spheres in Africa.
