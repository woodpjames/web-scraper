Encouraging the Ethiopian authorities to reconsider several of the restrictive provisions of the Charities and Societies Draft Proclamation ensuring an enabling environment for NGOs and that the policy formulation process should be one that allows for the active participation of the civil society community and other stakeholders;2. Calling on the Ethiopian authorities  to end all practices which threaten freedom of expression and prevent human rights defenders and particularly journalists from pursuing their legitimate work;3. Calling on the Ethiopian authorities to carry out  prompt, impartial, effective and independent investigations into all cases of human rights violations, both past and present, particularly those affecting human rights defenders and most notably the human rights abuses which took place in the aftermath of the general elections 2005;4. Encouraging the Ethiopian authorities to allow for independent and unimpeded access by national and international human rights groups and the media to regions of particular concern;5. Calling on African Union member States to support initiatives by HRDs in Ethiopia aimed at strengthening their position, notably through join initiatives and networks;6. Recommending to AU member States to ensure that all HRDs in particular journalists that have been forced into exile can pursue their vital work by providing them with assistance and protection;7. Recommending to AU member States that all forthcoming assistance to the Ethiopian government from the African Union, notably given its key position, should demand human rights accountability.Done in Abuja, November 9th, 2008The African Centre for Democracy and Human Rights Studies (ACDHRS)Website: www.acdhrs.orgEmail: admin@acdhrs.orgZoe Tembo Building Kerr Serign,
