We participants to the NGO Forum in the 51st Ordinary Session of the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights and 25th African Human Rights Book Fair held from 14th-16 April, 2012 in Banjul, The GambiaConscious that Freedom of Expression plays a vital role in the effective enjoyment of all other human rights and conscious that the assuring safety and security of journalists forms an integral part of the protection of the rights to informationHorrified by the killing of four journalists in Somalia these last five monthsDenouncing the increasing of physical attacks of journalists/media houses by both state agents and non-state agents in African state like Tunisia, Guinea Conakry, Angola, Sudan, Senegal, Mali, Guinea BissauNoting that these physical attacks are systematic in critical periods or situations such as of electoral campaigns, demonstrations, coups, etc.Concerned by the persistence of lawsuits against journalists affiliated and human rights activists in most African countries as it is the case in Côte d’Ivoire, The Gambia, in ZimbabweNoting that these lawsuits are favoured by the existence in these countries of inadequate legal frameworks touching to freedom of expression and access to informationFurther concerned by the prevalence of illegal arrests and detentions of journalists on the continent, namely in The Gambia, Côte d’Ivoire and in Eritrea where 32 journalists are still in jail with some of them reported deadNoting that journalists continue to be seriously threaten, discredited, humiliated or impoverished in relation to their work by the state machinery using comprehensive systems to weaken or suppress independent journalism as it is the case in Ethiopia and Burundi where terrorism charges are used against journalists; in Sudan with the government security agents systematically raided private media houses after publication and confiscated large publication forcing these media houses to lose lot of revenue while at the same time prosecuting journalists . In the same vein the government is also buying out some of the private media, with a mission to entirely change the editorial line and focus. Journalists are specifically targeted and attacked with impunity while covering demonstrations.Recalling the 2002 Declaration on Principles of Freedom of Expression and Access to Information in Africa and previous resolutions, particularly the 2011 resolution on freedom of expression, access to information and protection of journalistsWe recommend the African Commission to:Done in Banjul- 16th April, 2012The African Centre for Democracy and Human Rights Studies (ACDHRS)Website: www.acdhrs.orgEmail: admin@acdhrs.orgZoe Tembo Building Kerr Serign,
