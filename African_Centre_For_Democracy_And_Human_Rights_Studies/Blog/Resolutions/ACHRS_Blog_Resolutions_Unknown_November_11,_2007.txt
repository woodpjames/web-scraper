By the separation of children breaching the law in detention with adults in jail.2. By the settlement of these children in specialized and sufficiently equipped reformation and reinsertion centres, considering the specificity of these children and their training under the control of specialized teachers with the assistance of health workers.3. By the training of children judges as well as their teachers.4. By penalizing the acts and behaviours encouraging and providing grounds for juvenile delinquency in all its forms.Done at Brazzaville, November 11th, 2007The African Centre for Democracy and Human Rights Studies (ACDHRS)Website: www.acdhrs.orgEmail: admin@acdhrs.orgZoe Tembo Building Kerr Serign,
