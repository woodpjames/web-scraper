The attack on the freedom of expression has also been widespread and has lead to over 25 journalists leaving Gambia since 1994 and is depriving Gambians everywhere of their right to access objective and unbiased information.Recalling that unlawful arrests and detention, torture while in detention, unfair trials, poor conditions of detention, extrajudicial executions, enforced disappearances  without access to a fair trial and in deplorable, life-threatening conditions and the denial of the freedom of the press and expression contravenes national, regional and international law.Recalling the continued ill-treatment of non-Gambians, especially West Africans, in particular the case of the unsolved killings of fifty migrants, including 44 Ghanaians, who were allegedly killed and/or disappeared in the Gambia.Hereby call on the African Commission Human and Peoples’ Rights to take all the necessary measures to ensure that Gambia complies with its obligations under the African Charter by undertaking the following:1. Investigating and ensuring accountability for reported cases of human rights    violations in the Gambia.2. Immediate and unconditional release of all victims of enforced disappearances – including Chief Ebrima Manneh and Kanyi Kaniba who have been unlawfully detained for more than two years-, as well as other detainees  including prisoners of conscience who are confined in various prisons and unknown detention facilities across the country or offer them public and fair trial;3. Realizing and implementing the constitution of the country especially with respect to Gambians right to liberty; freedom from torture, right to a fair trial, and freedom of the press and association.4. Ceasing all acts of torture in detention, interference in the judiciary especially in cases of political trials, and all extrajudicial executions.5.
