November 9, 2008
We, the participants of the Forum on the Participation of NGOs in the 44th Ordinary Session of the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights resolve as follows:Considering the provisions of the Constitutive Act of the African Union, the Charter of the United Nations, as well as those of the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights and other regional and international human rights instruments to which the Sudan is a state party;Restating that Sudan is legally bound to fully implement the provisions of its own constitution, the Interim National Constitution, and regional and international instruments to which it is signatory; and particularly to respect and promote the human rights and fundamental freedoms set therein, without discrimination on any ground;Further considering Sudan’s obligations under the 1998 Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognised Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders), particularly to ensure the rights of human rights defenders to assemble, associate, express themselves and participate in the government of the country and the conduct of public affairs;Recalling relevant decisions and communiqués adopted by the UN, the AU Assembly of Heads of State and Government on the situation in Darfur;Appreciating the decision of the International Criminal Court to issue arrest warrants against individuals accused of organizing, planning, supervising, executing or encouraging the commission of ethnic cleansing, war crimes and crimes against humanity in Darfur;Deeply concerned at the continuing grave violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in Darfur; notably the recent attacks on civilians in operations carried out against rebel forces which have once again forced thousands to flee from their homes;Regretting the apparent failure of the United Nations-African Union Mission to Darfur (UNAMID) to offer civilians the protection they require;Condemning the widespread violence against women and children in Darfur, most notably at the hands of armed groups;Deeply concerned by the measures taken by the Sudanese Security Services following the attacks on Omdurman by the rebel Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) on the 10th May 2008; these measures have included mass arrests, prolonged periods of detention without charge, torture and disappearances of civilians, primarily of Darfuri origin;Dismayed by the continued use of laws which are at odds with the Constitution and with international human rights standards; notably the National Security Act which is persistently used to interfere with freedom of expression and human rights activism through arbitrary arrests and detentions;Concerned by the increasing restrictions on freedom of media and expression notably in Khartoum, restrictions which are of particular concern given that Sudan is at crucial stage in the roadmap to democratization with the initiation of a country-wide census which should pave the way for national elections in 2009.NGO Forum-Net calls upon the ACHPR to take all necessary measures to pass a resolution:1.
