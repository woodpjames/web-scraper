Next year and year after, many other African counties will engage in decisive electoral process, on which depend the reinforcement of democracy and rule of law in Africa.Your Excellency, Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen,Allow me by concluding my statement to address all my congratulation to all of you, particularly to the NGO Forum Steering Committee, to the Executive Director of the Center on the work done to organize and to improve the NGO Forum every six months. With all those effort, I have no doubt that your deliberations during three days will be fruitful for your own work and the work of the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights.Thank You for your attention.The African Centre for Democracy and Human Rights Studies (ACDHRS)Website: www.acdhrs.orgEmail: admin@acdhrs.orgZoe Tembo Building Kerr Serign,
