Moreover, we are all here today, witnesses at this momentous silver jubilee session of the African Commission and would like to take this opportunity to salute, most especially, all past and present Commissioners.  We congratulate the current Chairperson, HE Catherine Dupe Atoki and Members of the African Commission; the Secretary and Members of the Secretariat for continuing to keeping the torch of human rights shining; to all State Parties and indeed the people of Africa for whom this treaty body was established.The role of the African Union in strengthening the continental framework to promote and protect human and peoples’ rights in Africa has spurred the pursuit of human rights which has become an integral responsibility, by ensuring that the Human Rights Strategy for Africa is at the heart of the African Governance Architecture. The increased involvement of civil society organisations in the consultative processes are exemplary and commendable and have indeed gone a long way to enhance partnerships and promote ownership of the various processes by the African people.While applauding these developments, the Forum asserted that Africa continues to face serious human rights challenges characterised by conflict, insecurity and violence.  Poverty, disease, internal political strife, resulting in the taking up of arms by rebel groups, arbitrary detention and extrajudicial killings continue to bring hardships to the majority of citizens of the affected countries, especially the women and children.  The situation in some States have remained a cause for concern, including Mali, Sudan and DRC where serious and massive human rights violations are being perpetrated against civilian population, serious challenges which call for a constant and increasing strengthening of the protective and promotional mandate of the Commission. The ‘Marikana incident’ in South Africa; the increasing and continuing Boka Haram attacks in Nigeria were also among the issues discussed.Furthermore, the treatment of prisoners especially those on the death row brought the recently related cases that took place in The Gambia to the fore.  As a result the Forum called on States to respect the right to life and the moratorium on the death penalty.The Declaration of the Forum will be forwarded, for the kind consideration of your august body, as our contribution to your deliberations at this 52nd Session.Your Excellencies, Distinguished Ladies and GentlemenOn behalf of the participants, please allow me to reiterate the readiness of the NGO community to work with these mechanisms in the realization of their mandates. As partners in the process, we are committed to putting all our expertise and resources at the disposal of the African Commission in the realization of the various objectives.In the true spirit of the African Union’s Constitutive Act in which the Heads of State of Africa professed a ‘common vision of a united and strong Africa, energised by partnership between governments and all segments of civil society’, representatives at this Forum reaffirmed their commitment to the reinforcement of this partnership with the African Union and all its organs, not the least, the African Commission, in the furtherance of human rights, good governance and the rule of law in Africa.  The Forum participants have continued to demonstrate their  dedication to the work of the African Commission by their enthusiastic and passionate contributions to the preparations leading to their participation in this Session.The Forum, while pleased with the progress made by the African Commission notes that serious challenges with the potential to affect its effectiveness persist. I would like to take this opportunity to launch an appeal to states and indeed the international community to continue to support the strengthening of this institution, which will, no doubt, go a long way towards the effective implementation of it mandate.Your Excellencies, Distinguished Ladies and GentlemenOn behalf of ACDHRS and indeed the participants of the Forum of NGOs, allow me to wish The Honourable Chairperson and all the Members of the Commission, fruitful deliberations and a successful silver jubilee session.Thank You for your kind attention.HJF,
