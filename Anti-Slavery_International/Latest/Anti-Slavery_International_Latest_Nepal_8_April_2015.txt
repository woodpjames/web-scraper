Call on Nepal to address bonded labour
8 April 2015
8 April 2015Anti-Slavery International, Informal Sector Service Centre (INSEC) and Backward Society Education (BASE) have called on Nepal to tackle bonded and forced labour of adults and children.Forced and bonded labour continues to persist in Nepal, despite government promises to ensure the system is eradicated. A recent ILO report found approximately 143,000 adults and 30,000 children still subject to forced labour.
