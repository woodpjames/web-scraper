26 June 2009
26 June 2009A new report by Human Right Watch has accused the Zimbabwean military of using forced labour in the Marange diamond fields in the east of the country.The report accuses Zanu-PF controlled soldiers of forcing hundreds of children and adults to mine for diamonds, as well as torturing and beating villagers suspected of supporting illegal miners or not working for the army.The report also gives details of the alleged massacre of more than 200 people during a brutal three week take over of the diamond fields by the military in October and November 2008.Human Rights Watch estimate that a properly regulated diamond industry could generate $200 million a month for the cash strapped country.
