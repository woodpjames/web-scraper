Modern Slavery Act comes into force
31 July 2015
31 July 2015Press releaseAnti-Slavery International welcomes the Modern Slavery Act coming into force on Friday 31 July but stressed it is only a modest step to eradicate modern slavery in the country.Director of Anti-Slavery International Dr Aidan McQuade said: “Although some elements of the Act have the potential to make a difference for people affected by modern slavery both in Britain and abroad, those elements are not enough to feel too excited about the new law. History has showed that laws alone are not sufficient to eradicate slavery if there are not accompanied by a wider shift in policies”The act introduces some victim protection measures, in particular legal advocates for trafficked children that will provide children greater specialised protection, and possibility for victims to be protected from prosecution for crimes they forced to commit whilst in slavery. Other positives include consolidation of all slavery related offences  introduction of an Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner and a requirement on businesses to report on efforts to tackle slavery in their supply chains.However, there are glaring black holes that remain unaddressed: the law does not guarantee minimum standards of protection of victims’ rights, requirement on migrant domestic workers to prove they have been trafficked before they can leave their abusive employers and find new ones, the lack of extraterritoriality of the slavery offence, and a loophole which allows companies hide their supply chains overseas as long as the goods they produce don’t end up in Britain.Dr McQuade said: “This law is simply not enough. If we want to prosecute traffickers, we need the victims to act as witnesses in courts, and it won’t happen without them being fully protected and their rights being recognised.“The government gave de facto license for trafficking to the employers of overseas domestic workers by forbidding the workers to change the employers even in abusive situations”“Businesses having to report on slavery in their supply chains is welcome. But surely the British Government should have the power to exclude any goods produced with the use of forced labour from entering into UK markets.“It’s good the government has put slavery on its agenda and certainly some changes are positive but there still a long way to go, particularly in aligning aid, trade and diplomacy on this issue.”For more information and to arrange interviews please contact Anti-Slavery International Press Officer Jakub Sobik on 07789 936 383 or at j.sobik@antislavery.org.
