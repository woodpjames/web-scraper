Transatlantic Slave Trade seminars – resources, training and 
27 March 2008
27 March 2008As part of the 2007 bicentenary commemorations, Anti-Slavery International launched the Recovered Histories project, an outreach and resources programme. 2007 provided a basis for creating dialogue about the Transatlantic Slave Trade and its legacies, Recovered Histories seeks to continue this work beyond 2007.Anti-Slavery International is inviting participants to a series of free regional seminars in April and May 2008 to bring together a wide range of groups and organisations who are working on these issues and interested in making links, creating sustainable networks and sharing appropriate practice. These will include grassroots community organisations, youth clubs and associations, women’s groups, faith groups, schools, libraries, local authority departments, development education centres and museums. The seminars will also introduce participants to the available free resources (including an education pack and exhibition) and look at how to use them effectively in a variety of local and national settings.It is vitally important that the legacies of the Transatlantic Slave Trade which continue to affect all of us today are addressed with accurate information in order to foster greater and more effective community cohesion. Recovered Histories will link groups and organisations from across the UK in dialogue and practical work around these issues.To register, download a registration form and return it to us by email at j.howarth@antislavery.org, fax 020 7738 4110, or post to Recovered Histories, Anti-Slavery International, Thomas Clarkson House, The Stableyard, Broomgrove Road, London, SW9 9TL.This project was supported by the National Lottery through the Heritage Lottery Fund.For further information information on the seminars or to arrange an interview please contact Gemma Wolfes, Communications Officer, Anti-Slavery International, on 020 7501 8936, or email j.howarth@antislavery.orgFor further information about the project and resources, please visit http://www.recoveredhistories.org
