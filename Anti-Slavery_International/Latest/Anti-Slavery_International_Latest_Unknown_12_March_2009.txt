Clinton and Obama honour Hadijatou
12 March 2009
12 March 2009Hilary Clinton and Michelle Obama have honoured a former slave in recognition of her courage in combating slavery in her home country of Niger.The US Secretary of State and First Lady presented 24-year-old Hadijatou Mani with the International Women of Courage Award in Washington DC, yesterday (Wednesday 12 March 2009).Though the practice was criminalised in 2003 at least 43,000 people remain in slavery across Niger. Hadijatou was born into a slave ‘caste’ and sold to her master at the age of 12 for the equivalent of $500. She was made to work without pay and was used as a sexual slave.After failing to receive justice from local courts Hadijatou took her case to the Community Court of Justice of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), which made the historic decision to condemn the state of Niger for failing to protect her from slavery.US Secretary of State Hilary Clinton said: “Hadijatou is such an inspiring person. Enslaved by being sold at a very young age, she never gave up on herself or on her deep reservoir of human dignity. When she finally escaped from slavery, she didn’t forget those who were still enslaved. For her inspiring courage in successfully challenging an entrenched system of caste-based slavery, and securing a legal precedent that will help countless others seek freedom and justice, we honour and salute her.”Hadijatou was assisted in bringing the case by INTERIGHTS, the International Centre for the Legal Protection of Human Rights, with support from Anti-Slavery International and Niger NGO Timidria.Hadijatou was one of the eight recipients selected from across the world to be presented with the Secretary of State’s Award for International Women of Courage. She was nominated by the US Embassy in Niger for her extraordinary work in advancing human rights.
