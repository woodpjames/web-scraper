UK establishes national slavery memorial day
28 January 2008
28 January 2008The Government has announced that the 23 August — UNESCO’s day for the International Remembrance of the Slave Trade and its Abolition — will be adopted as the focal date for national commemorations in the years to come.A national slavery memorial day was one of the goals of Anti-Slavery International’s Fight for Freedom campaign and we believe the establishment of such a day will provide an important platform for building on the awareness that has been raised during 2007.The Government has said that groups looking to mark the 23 August in the coming years will be able to apply to the Heritage Lottery Fund for support as well as the Big Lottery Fund and Arts Council England.In September 2008, the slave trade will also become a compulsory element in schools (under Key Stage 3 of the history curriculum) and pupils will learn about the history and impact of slavery alongside other important events in the last century, such as the World Wars and the Holocaust.Speaking at the Museum in Docklands in December last year, Communities Minister Parmjit Dhanda reflected on the bicentenary and noted:“People across the country have been reminded of the suffering of millions who were enslaved; celebrated the courage of those who struggled for emancipation; and recommitted this country to the struggle against the unacceptable forms of slavery which sadly still persist.“This year we have also rightly had an opportunity to celebrate the enormous contribution Black African and Black Caribbean communities make in Britain. However, we need to take targeted action to deal with the legacy of inequality in relation to education, employment and race still faced by some parts of those communities.”
