22 August 2007
22 August 2007On 23 August, International Day for the Remembrance of the Slave Trade and its Abolition, Anti-Slavery International launches its newest website. Recovered Histories: Reawakening the narratives of enslavement, resistance and the fight for freedom www.recoveredhistories.org provides insight into the Transatlantic Slave Trade and the struggle between those seeking to maintain the trade and those fighting for its abolition.Containing over 40,000 digitised pages of literature on the slave trade, Recovered Histories makes Anti-Slavery International’s collection of literature on the Transatlantic Slave Trade widely available on the internet for the first time. www.recoveredhistories.org will be live from Thursday 23 August 2007.It covers over 100 years of campaigning in Europe and the Americas, capturing the voices of the enslaved, enslavers, slave ship surgeons, abolitionists, parliamentarians, clergy and rebels.The website chronicles enslavement as an institution and an enforced way of life; the Middle Passage; and Triangular Trade. Included are arguments condemning and supporting the slave trade, evidence gathered to present to Parliament in the 18th and 19th centuries, illustrations of life on the plantations, and details of slave uprisings in the Caribbean and the attempts by many enslaved Africans to liberate themselves and determine their own futures.“In this bicentenary year of Britain’s abolition of the slave trade, it is important to recognise the significance of slave resistance to the success of this crucial struggle. Recovered Histories sheds light on the realities of this brutal chapter and the legacies that affect our world today,” Jeff Howarth of Anti-Slavery International said.A clear and simple layout enables the reader to navigate easily through texts, access explanatory background pages, activities and a glossary of terms.A hardcopy exhibition based on the Recovered Histories website will be available from October 2007 and will support a comprehensive outreach programme for community groups, schools and the general public. Educational resources will be available from November 2007.This project was supported by the National Lottery through the Heritage Lottery Fund.
