17 July 2007
17 July 2007A man was sentenced to death and 28 others imprisoned on 17 July for using forced labour in brick kilns in Shanxi province, China.Those found guilty include a brick kiln supervisor who was sentenced to death for killing a man and a kiln foreman who was sentenced to life in prison for illegal detention and intentionally hurting workers. A kiln owner, son of a local Communist Party official, was sentenced to nine years in prison.Over 570 adults and children were freed from slavery in raids on brick kilns; many had been abducted and sold as labour.They were forced to work 16 to 20 hours a day for no pay and meagre food, housed in squalid conditions, locked in and kept under guard. They were only allowed out for work, were regularly beaten and suffered a range of injuries. At least 13 died from overwork and abuse, reports say.Ninety-five officials have been punished for dereliction of duty in supervising the kilns. According to reports 35,000 police carried out raids in June against 7,500 brick kilns across Shanxi and Henan provinces. The investigation was prompted after parents of missing children posted a petition on the internet demanding action after officials ignored their pleas for help. More trials are expected.
