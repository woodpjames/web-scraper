Despite promising them US$200 and US$100 per month, they received nothing. They were forced to work from 4.00am to 1.00am, seven days a week. They were only allowed out at night in order to empty the rubbish and were treated with brutality.The women said they were fed so little that in desperation they had to take extra food from their employer and hide it.The Sabhnanis are charged with two counts of forced labour; the trial date is 10 September.
