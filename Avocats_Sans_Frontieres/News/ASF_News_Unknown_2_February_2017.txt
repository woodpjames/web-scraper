Fostering respect at ASF events
2 February 2017
2 February 2017The events and conferences run by Avocats Sans Frontières are notable for their warm and friendly atmosphere, based around the enthusiastic manner in which knowledge and experiences are shared.Wishing to make our guests feel as safe and relaxed as possible, and in line with the organisation’s values, we have recently adopted an anti-harassment and anti-discrimination policy.Where necessary, this policy aims to govern the behaviour of all participants at ASF events – members of the team, speakers, volunteers, suppliers, etc.We would encourage you to consult the policy and to let us know if you have any questions about it.We hope you will enjoy reading it and look forward to seeing you at our next event!
