ASF opens new headquarters in Brussels
23 February 2017
23 February 2017Brussels, 23 February 2017 – The start of 2017 has been marked by a sense of renewal for Avocats Sans Frontières. For the past eight years, our premises on the rue de Namur have served as the base for the work of our dedicated team, but this Monday our Brussels headquarters relocated to a different quarter of the city: avenue de la Chasse 140, in Etterbeek. Our new base is more central than ever, allowing us to remain at the heart of the capital and its affairs, with the Belgian and European institutions just a stone’s throw away.When choosing a location for our new premises, ease of access for our Belgian and international visitors – particularly those using public transport – was one of the key criteria. A new map is available on our site.Although our address has changed, our values and mission remain the same. They will always be a fundamental part of who we are, not only in Brussels but in Kinshasa, Tunis, Bangui and N’Djamena – because that is where the work of Avocats Sans Frontières and its partners in support of access to justice for the most vulnerable really takes place – in the field.Your support is more vital than ever if we are to ensure that every person seeking justice is able to assert their rights.Thank you in advance
