Rwanda : Opening of a New Legal Clinic
26 April 2011
26 April 2011On the 2nd March 2011, the ASF team in Rwanda officially inaugurated the legal clinic in Muhanga (Southern Province).The clinic – the second, after that of Gisenyi, to have been established in the country – is located in the town centre. Two days a week, the population of Muhanga and of the surrounding area may attend the clinic to receive free legal advice. As the Southern Province is the most densely populated area of the country, there is no doubt  that the clinic will fulfill a very real need in the community with regard to information and to legal representation.A mobile team, composed of lawyers who are collaborating with ASF, also attends the three principle prisons in the province (Gitarama, Huye et Gikongoro) in order to provide legal advice to the detainees and to run information and awareness-raising sessions on their rights.The inauguration of clinic took place in the presence of representatives of the Govenor of the province, the Vice-Mayor of the district, the President of the Bar of Kigali, representatives of our principle sponsors (USAID et PEPFAR), as well as a large number of civil society representatives.
