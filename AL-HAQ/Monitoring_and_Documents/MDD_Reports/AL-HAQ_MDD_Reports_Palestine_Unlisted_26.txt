MONITORING AND DOCUMENTATION UNIT: JANUARY-MARCH 2005 REPORT
Unlisted
IntroductionThis is the first of regular three-monthly reports which Al-Haq’s Monitoring and Documentation Unit intends on making available on the organisation’s website, to highlight specific human rights violations and/or patterns of abuse that come to the attention of the Unit.First-hand documentation by Al-Haq’s Monitoring and Documentation Unit constitutes the backbone for all other projects and activities of the organisation, and is gathered throughout the West Bank by Al-Haq’s five fieldworkers from its primary resources through getting data and affidavits from victims of human rights violations and/or eyewitnesses.i While the unit documents only a certain number of human rights violations in a comprehensive manner (namely killings, punitive house demolitions, those due to lack of license, curfews and deportations), other violations are documented regularly but not comprehensively through affidavits, and could vary depending on the needs and ongoing activities of Al-Haq’s other units. Subsequently the information gathered is channelled into Al-Haq’s various activities, such as campaigns; interventions at the local and international levels, press releases and research reports.The Human Rights Situation Since the Beginning of the Current IntifadaIn order to understand the human rights violations that are taking place in 2005, it is important to put them within the context of the deterioration witnessed in the general human rights situation since the beginning of the current intifada in 2000, and the continuous disregard by Israel for international human rights and humanitarian law in the OPT.As an Occupying Power in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Israel remains in effective control of the territory, and therefore has legal obligations towards the protection of the Palestinian civilian population therein. Nevertheless, Israel persists with serious violations of human rights in the name of security and counter-terrorism. Since 2000, the majority of these measures have also failed to fulfil the principles of necessity and proportionality, and have in most cases amounted to collective punishment or measures of intimidation, which under international law, are prohibited at all times.According to Al-Haq’s documentation, from the beginning of the intifada until the end of 2004, 1,460 Palestinians were killed, 276 of which are children, and 83 of which are women and young girls. In addition, it is estimated that 228 were killed by in targeted assassinations. Moreover, Al-Haq’s fieldwork confirms that in the majority of cases killings were committed either by Israeli occupying forces or by Special Undercover Units, and occurred in situations where there were no confrontations taking place. In the case of house demolitions, Al-Haq noted that during the same time period, 425 homes were totally demolished in the West Bank, thereby displacing an average 2,940 persons. So far, both Hebron and Nablus registered the largest number of houses demolished as a punitive measure. Israel also carried out a large number of house demolitions on the pretext of lack of license. By end of 2004, 138 houses were administratively demolished for lack of license, 60 of which took place in East Jerusalem alone.
