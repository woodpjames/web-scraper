MONITORING AND DOCUMENTATION DEPARTMENT JULY - SEPTEMBER 2007 FIELD REPORT
Unlisted
This is the third quarterly field report of 2007 by Al-Haq's Monitoring and Documentation Department, covering the period from July to September 2007. Al-Haq’s field reports cover human rights abuses committed by the Israeli Occupying Power and the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and Gaza. Each field report highlights a particularly important and disturbing trend observed by the Monitoring and Documentation Department concerning the ongoing violations of human rights and international humanitarian law during the reporting period.On Wednesday, 19 September the Israeli Security Cabinet unanimously voted to declare the Gaza Strip an “enemy entity,” ostensibly paving the way for the imposition of collective penalties on the 1.5 million Palestinian civilians living in the Gaza Strip. These include intensifying the already severe border closures, limiting the provision of essential supplies, and dramatically reducing the supply of electricity, all of which will exacerbate the existing dire humanitarian crisis.On 14 July 2007, President Abbas took further steps to consolidate the position of the emergency government by allowing the Prime Minister and his cabinet to resign, and then immediately re-appointing them as an ‘interim’ government. It is this ‘interim’ government that currently constitutes, for practical purposes, the PNA, although it exercises no control in the Gaza Strip. Hamas, which is in full control of the Gaza Strip and has refused to accept the dismissal of Ismail Haniyeh and the current government or accept the legitimacy of the successive emergency and ‘interim’ governments, has repeatedly called President Abbas’ actions unconstitutional and illegal.In the days and months following the take-over both the ‘interim’ government in the West Bank and the de facto Hamas government in the Gaza Strip have continued to act without due regard for the rule of law or fundamental human rights guarantees.The field reports are based on first-hand information gathered by Al-Haq's Monitoring and Documentation Department, covering a broad range of human rights abuses, including comprehensive coverage of killings, house demolitions and curfews. Al-Haq’s specially trained fieldworkers visit sites of alleged human rights violations, draw maps, draft reports and take sworn witness statements (affidavits) from victims and eyewitnesses. The affidavits excerpted or referenced in field reports are available on Al-Haq’s web site www.alhaq.org, as samples of those gathered during the reporting period.The Human Rights Situation since the Outbreak of the Second IntifadaThe human rights violations committed during the reporting period must be analysed in the broader context of the deteriorating general human rights situation since the outbreak of the second intifada on 29 September 2000, and Israel’s persistent failure to apply international human rights and humanitarian law in the OPT. Al-Haq has only recently dispatched a fieldworker in Gaza and therefore does not have comprehensive statistics similar to those of the West Bank.According to Al-Haq's documentation, from the outbreak of the second intifada until the end of September 2007, Israeli occupation forces killed 1,796 Palestinians in the West Bank, 346 of whom were children, and 93 of whom were females. It is estimated that 294 Palestinians were killed in the course of targeted assassination operations. During the same period, Al-Haq documented the demolition, for punitive reasons, of 547 homes in the West Bank (whereof 491 were totally demolished and 55 were partially demolished, and two totally sealed), leading to the displacement of 3,276 people. Israel has also carried out a large number of administrative house demolitions on the pretext that the houses were built without the required licence. Since the beginning of 2004, 498 houses have been demolished for lack of licence, 220 of which were in East Jerusalem.
