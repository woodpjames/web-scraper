According to Al-Haq's documentation, from the outbreak of the second intifada until the end of June 2010, 1,911 Palestinians were killed in the West Bank, 374 of whom were children, and 105 of whom were female. It is estimated that 313 Palestinians were killed in targeted assassinations. During the same period, Al-Haq documented a total of 575 punitive house demolitions (506 completely demolished, 63 partially demolished, and 6 completely sealed) in the West Bank, leading to the displacement of 3,357 people. Israel has also carried out a large number of house demolitions based on claims that the houses were built without the required permits (administrative house demolition). Since 2004, the Israeli authorities have demolished 685 houses due to lack of building permit; 292 of whom were in East Jerusalem.Violations committed by the Occupying Power:Highlighted Trend: Wilful Injury along the Northern Gaza Strip Borders
