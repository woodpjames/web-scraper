Five Palestinians Killed with Live Ammunition Among Incidents Documented by Al-Haq’s Field Research Team as Part of Ongoing Israeli Operations in the West Bank
Unlisted
Following the recent disappearance of the three Israeli settlers on 12 June 2014, Israel has been engaged in extensive searches, closures, raids and arrests across various cities in the West Bank. Israeli authorities labelled these collective actions and investigations as “Operation Brother’s Keeper”. In the operation’s course thus far, Israeli forces have shot and killed five Palestinians, including one child. According to Addameer Prisoner Support and Human Rights Association, Israel has arrested approximately 500 Palestinians across the West Bank since the start of the operation. Fifty-one of the recently detained Palestinians were previously released during the 2011 prisoners’ exchange with Israel. Approximately 77 of the Palestinians arrested are being held in administrative detention. In total, 12 members of the Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC) have been arrested since 12 June. The operation has also included late-night raids and ransacking of Palestinian homes, destruction and theft of private property, and the closure of checkpoints which further restricted the freedom of Palestinian movement. Additionally, settler violence has significantly increased since the beginning of the operation through deliberate targeting of Palestinian civilians in their homes and on the streets. The summaries below represent information, by governorate, which the Al-Haq field research team documented between 13 – 22 June 2014.
