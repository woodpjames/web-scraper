20_09_2016
On 5 September, Mustafa Nimer, a 27-year-old from Shufat refugee camp in Occupied East Jerusalem, was shot dead by Israeli Occupation Forces (IOF).The IOF alleged Mustafa was attempting a car ramming attack. Video evidence and eyewitness testimony emerged showing that Mustafa posed no threat to the IOF at the time of the shooting and the IOF police quickly retracted their story claiming that his killing was a mistake.There has been no prosecution initiated against the Israeli forces who fired the deadly shots. Instead, the driver of the car, Ali Nimer, is being charged with involuntary manslaughter for the death of his cousin.
