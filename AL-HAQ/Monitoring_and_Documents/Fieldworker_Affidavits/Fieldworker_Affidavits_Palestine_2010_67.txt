Affidavit No. 5413/2010
2010
My name is ‘Ayesh As’ad ‘Ayesh al-Sous. I am 25 years old who is married and a father of three children. I live in my family’s house which is located on the Thaknat Aslan Street west of Beit Lahiya town in the Northern Gaza governorate. To make a living and support my family, I collect stones on land of al-Muharrarat (former Israeli settlements) and sell them to merchants to be reused in construction.At around 8:00 am on Sunday, 2 May 2010, twenty fellow workers and I were collecting stones from land which was where the settlements of Nisanit and Eli Sinai were formerly located, in the northwest of Beit Lahiya town in the Northern Gaza governorate. We were at a distance of almost 400 metres from the Israeli border. We are used to collecting stones near the border because that is where plenty of stones are available. We, the workers, are cautious not to come as close as 300 metres to the Israeli border so as not to get hurt. While we were collecting stones and loading them on carts (drawn by donkeys) approximately 30 heavily armed Israeli soldiers of the Special Forces unit came out from inside the Separation Fence, opened intensive fire, and chased us. As I was running away with my peers, I sustained bullet wounds in my feet. My fellow workers carried and transported me to Kamal ‘Adwan Hospital in Beit Lahiya. After I arrived at the hospital, doctors offered me first aid and stitched my wounds. They told me to report to the hospital a month later because I needed to have a surgical operation to remove the bullet shrapnel on my feet.Before I left the hospital, I requested that the Hospital Administration give me a medical report on my condition but they refused. They claimed that they need to investigate the validity of my statement which explained that I had been injured by Israeli soldiers while I was collecting stones. Now, I am staying at home and cannot move. I can only move around the house using crutches.
