Affidavit No. 1968/2004
2004
On Tuesday, 7 September 2004, at 7:30  in the morning, I took my 42-year-old wife ManalYousef Hamad, and my  children Sundos (age 10), Sajida (age nine), to the bridgeconnecting  Halhoul to Hebron in order to get to the Al-Safa school. Located in the  Ein Saraarea of Hebron, my wife works at al-Safa school as a teacher and  my daughter attends theschool. As I was trying to turn my car due to  military barricades separating Halhoul fromHebron at the bridge where  there were a lot of students, officials, and residents waiting forthe  Israeli army to give them permission to pass, I heard gunfire and the  shouts of my twodaughters who were in the company of their mother. I  looked behind, fearing for my family,who were about five metres away.I heard my wife yelling that my  daughters have been shot. I hurriedly ran towards them, andfound Sundos  with her hand on her wounded chest, crying and shaking with fear,  whileSajida was crying and had put her hand on her bleeding. I carried  the first daughter and puther in the car while my wife carried the other  and immediately drove to the Palestinian RedCrescent Society clinic in  Halhoul, two kilometres from the place of the shooting. When thedoctors  examined the injuries, it appeared that my daughters were shot with  rubber bullets,and that Sundos’ injury was more serious. The doctors  offered them the first aid requiredand kept them under observation for  24 hours. Then we continued their treatment at home.But the psychological pains that the  two girls, their mother and I experienced were the mostdifficult, and I  took the two girls to school on the second day to overcome their fears  andtheir psychological state. It is worth noting that movement is  usually allowed past barricadebefore the day my daughters were injured,  but on that day movement was completelyprohibited.This is my declaration and hereby I sign, on 15 September 2004.Signature: Muhammad 'Abd-al-Fattah Hasan Shahin
