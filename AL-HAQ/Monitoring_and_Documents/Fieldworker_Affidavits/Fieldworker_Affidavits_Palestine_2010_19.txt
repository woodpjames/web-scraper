Affidavit No. 5866/2010
2010
At around 3:30 pm on Friday 12 November 2010, I was on my way to play football in a playground near my house, which is in al-Farahin neighbourhood of ‘Abasan al-Kabira town, in the eastern Khan Younes governate. An armed, masked man intercepted me. He was in military uniform and was wearing a ribbon with ‘Izz-al-Din al-Qassam Brigades written on it. A number of other armed, masked individuals were in the area. The man stopped me and claimed that I had attacked a Hamas member who, along with others, had been attempting to disperse an event held the evening of the previous day in the area, marking the anniversary of the death of President Yaser ‘Arafat. Children had participated in the event and had let off fireworks. I denied what he said, and a quarrel broke out between us that developed into a fight.A number of armed individuals approached me and tried to hit me. In the meantime, a police force and two Magnum (police) jeeps arrived in the area. The police were carrying batons and sticks. I escaped from the armed individuals and ran back to my house. A number of armed men and police officers pursued me. A few metres from my house, a police officer hit me on the head with a stick, with such force that I fell to the ground. My eldest brother Wafiq (who is 30 years old) came out of the house. I saw him approach the armed men and the police officers and ask what had happened. As he approached them, an armed, masked man pointed his weapon at my brother. I heard the sound of two bullets and saw my brother Wafiq fall to the ground. “I am injured, I am injured” my brother shouted several times.I discovered later that my father and a number of relatives had taken my brother in a civilian car to the Nasser Governmental Hospital. Police officers and members of al-Qassam Brigades remained positioned in the area for several hours. They withdrew later. My brother sustained two bullet wounds - one in the pelvis and the other in the left thigh.
