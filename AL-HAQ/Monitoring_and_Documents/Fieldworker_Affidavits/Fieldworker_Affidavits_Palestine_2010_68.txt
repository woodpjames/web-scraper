Affidavit No. 5439/2010
2010
My name is Muhammad Mahmoud Saleh Abu-Warda. I am 23 years old, married, and father of three children – a boy and two girls. I live in the area of Bir al-Na’ja in Beit Hanoun town near the ‘Abbi Mosque and the Force 17 post in the Northern Gaza governorate. I collect stones on a cart and sell them to merchants to be used for construction purposes. I do so to make a living and provide for my family. The Israeli authorities deny access to construction materials to the Gaza Strip.At around 8:30 am on Saturday, 15 May 2010, six other fellow workers and I were collecting and loading stones on carts in the area of al-Maharrarat; the former Israeli settlements of Eli Sinai and Nisanit northwest of Beit Lahiya town in the Northern Gaza governorate. We were at a distance of almost 400 metres from the Israeli border. We were cautious not to come closer than that to the border because the Israeli occupying forces prevent residents of the Gaza Strip from being closer than 300 metres to the border.Suddenly, the occupying troops who were positioned on military watchtowers behind the Separation Fence opened fire on us. I sustained a bullet wound in my right foot and fell on the ground. Blood gushed out heavily from my foot. My fellow workers carried and put me on a cart and a worker called for an ambulance. After the cart travelled for about 10 minutes, an ambulance arrived and transported me to Kamal ‘Adwan Hospital in Beit Lahiya. After I arrived, doctors provided first aid and told me I had sustained a bullet wound in my right foot with an entry and exit. I had a surgical operation and my foot was fixed by installing a metal plate. I am due to have another operation in two months. I am now staying at hospital for medical treatment.
