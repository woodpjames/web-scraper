Affidavit No. 1641/2004
2004
I am a  resident of Beit Duqqo, one of the seven villages located northwest of  Jerusalemwhich are: Beit Duqqo, Beit Ijza, Beit 'Anan, Qattana, Khirbet  al-Lahem, al-Qbeiba, BeitSourik, and Biddo. On the morning of 5 December  2003, I found pamphlets thrown on theground and roads of our village,  stating that in accordance with a military order, certain areasof lands  will be seized from the lands of Beit Duqqo. Unfortunately, this order  will besiege1500 dunums of our land such that we will be unable to reach  these lands, which form ourbasic livelihood, especially under these  difficult economic conditions which the Palestiniansgo through. One  thousand dunums of our land are planted with olive and vine trees  inaddition to certain types of fruit trees.This order comes in benefit of the  Separation Wall, which in turn will besiege the abovementionedseven  villages and separate it from Jerusalem and Ramallah at the same  time.This situation will increase unemployment rates in these villages,  which will also raise thepoverty rates because most of the citizens in  these villages will lose their basic livelihoodsespecially that the  majority of the labour force in these villages had worked in Israel  beforethe Intifada. Now they have lost their work in Israel and there  are no job opportunities forthem to work in the West Bank. This  strangulating Wall comes to protect the security ofGiff’at Zi’ev and  Hadasha settlement. The occupation forces allege that the Separation  Wallwill pass and be constructed through the lands of the seven villages  but most of these landsare uncultivated and that the occupation forces  have made their best to minimize thedamages as much as possible. But the  fact is that 80 percent of the seized lands areagricultural lands  planted with trees and that these lands are the first economic pillar  forthese villages. The damage sustained by these villages is tremendous  “confiscation ofhundreds of dunums and siege of thousands.”This is my declaration and hereby I sign, on 14 February 2004
