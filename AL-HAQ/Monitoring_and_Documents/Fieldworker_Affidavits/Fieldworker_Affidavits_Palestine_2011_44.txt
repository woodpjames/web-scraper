Affidavit No. 6092/2011
2011
I am a resident of al-Ma’sara Village, southern Bethlehem. The Israeli settlement of Efrat is constructed on parts of our village lands as well as those of other nearby villages. Since 2006, the residents of our village have participated in weekly peaceful demonstrations against the Wall and settlement expansion. These demonstrations take place every Friday and are organized by the Popular Resistance Committee, of which I am a member. The Israeli army usually disrupts our peaceful demonstrations that are normally joined by Israeli and international peace activists, with the use of force.On Friday, 14 January 2011, the protestors participating in the weekly peaceful demonstration took off at 12:10 pm from the village school and headed towards the Wall, which separates our village from Efrat Settlement. The demonstration moved about one kilometer within the village before reaching the main road leading towards the aforementioned settlement. There, we found an Israeli force of about 40 soldiers and border policemen, who prevented us from reaching the main road. For this reason, we  stopped and started chanting slogans. While my back was in the direction of the soldiers, one of the soldiers suddenly pushed me powerfully. I fell about three meters far.I then stood up once again feeling pain in different parts of my body. I returned home afterwards where the pain intensified, especially in my lower back. As a result of the pain I experienced from the push, I couldn’t go to work for two consecutive days. I am gradually recovering, but still feel some pain in my lower back.
