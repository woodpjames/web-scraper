Affidavit No. 5175/2009
2009
Several hours after I was detained and the firing ceased, Mr. Jihad, the owner of the house, entered the room. He told me he was surprised to see me in the room and he thought that I had been arrested. Immediately, he removed the blindfold, cut off the handcuffs, and said that the soldiers had left the house. I got out of the house and went to our building. At this time, I saw soldiers withdraw from the street. It was about 7:00 am. As I entered the first floor, I saw a blanket covering an area of about 10 metres in the yard on the first floor of the building, located over the roof of a store. When I lifted the blanket, I was shocked to see the corpse of my brother „Anan, which was covered in blood. As I started to shout, a number of my neighbours shortly arrived and carried the dead body to the street. An ambulance arrived and transported my brother to the Rafidia Hospital in the city of Nablus. Having examined the corpse, doctors found out that my brother had sustained several bullet wounds and shrapnel all over his body.It should be noted that my brother, who was a Palestinian Preventive Security officer, had obtained an exemption for his role in the intifada from the Palestinian Authority and Israel several months ago. Conditions of the exemption stated that he must not leave Nablus or stay overnight with his friends. His friends must not stay overnight with him either. My brother complied with these conditions.
