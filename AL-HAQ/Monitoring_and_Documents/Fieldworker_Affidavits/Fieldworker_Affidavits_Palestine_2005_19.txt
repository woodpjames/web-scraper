Affidavit No. 2463/2005
2005
On 2 July  2005, I left my birth village Wadi Burqin, Jenin Governorate, going  towards Allenby Bridge in Jericho and from there to Jordan for receiving  medical treatment because I suffer from acute pain from my heart  although I had earlier in 1996 undergone a heart surgery in Jordan  Hospital in Amman. But due to the pains that returned to me during the  last period, doctors advised me to go to the same hospital in Amman for  making medical tests.I arrived  at Allenby Bridge at ten in the morning. While I was in the Israeli  Hall where Israeli soldiers verify the identity cards and passports, I  was surprised when the Israeli female soldier told me that I am banned  from traveling for security reasons and asked me to return to the West  Bank. This incident surprised me because I am not an activist in any  Palestinian resistance movement. Bur I was arrested by the Israeli army  on 9 January 2003 and remained in detention until 7 February 2003 and  since then I have not been arrested nor has the army broken into my  home. I am in pressing need for traveling to Jordan for medical  treatment, which is only available in Jordanian hospitals. Every day of  delay will expose my health to danger. For this reason, I appeal to  Al-Haq requesting its assistance in obtaining a travel permit for me to  Jordan for treatment, knowing that I pay all the costs and expenses of  treatment. As you see, I am suffering from severe pain, inability to  move and work. I would like to note that I am a father of eight children  and I am the only breadwinner for my family and I work in Jenin  Governmental Hospital as a labourer.This is my declaration and hereby I sign, 19 July 2005Signature: Bassam Ahmad
