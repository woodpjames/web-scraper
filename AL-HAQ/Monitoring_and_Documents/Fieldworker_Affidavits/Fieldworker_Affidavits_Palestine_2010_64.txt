Affidavit No. 5378/2010
2010
I am a resident of the city of Jenin. I own a 2008 Volkswagen taxi and work on the Jenin-Jericho route transporting passengers to and from the waiting area near the Allenby Bridge.I was, at most, 50 metres from the man who began to approach my car while I was waiting for instructions from the Israeli soldiers.“I have been here for a long time. I need to go, but the soldiers refuse to allow me to cross because I am a French citizen and do not have a Palestinian ID card.” He told me.At al-Duyuk checkpoint, vehicles heading out of Jericho are subjected to thorough searches but it is usually the case that the checkpoint is open for vehicles going into Jericho and Israeli troops positioned there do not normally search passing cars. I tried to approach the checkpoint to get to the hospital, but a soldier threateningly pointed his weapon at me. I shouted that I had a sick man with me and that he should be transported to hospital immediately.
