Affidavit No. 4107/2008
2008
I live in Zbuba village located west of Jenin city. The Separation Wall has been partly constructed on the lands of this village or in the vicinity of the houses of Zbuba village. As you can see, the Wall is no further than 20 metres north of my home and of that of my brother Mahmud Sa’id Jaradat.The Wall in Zbuba village is composed of electronic barbed wires, concrete and sand roads as well as ditches. Therefore, our suffering because of the Wall is continuous and permanent. Israeli soldiers constantly raid the village and carry out inspections, especially in houses located in the vicinity of the Wall. For example, the Israeli army raids my house at least once a month under the pretext of searching it for people who throw stones at the fence.Since the beginning of 2008, the soldiers started to target the children of the village under the pretext that they throw stones at the fence and try to dig holes in the iron fence to sneak out to the territories occupied in 1948. The last victim of this new practice was my 16 year old nephew, Saddam Mahmoud Sa’id Jaradat, born on 3 February 1992, who was arrested by the Israeli military force. This force raided Zbuba village at around 8:00 pm on 24 February 2008. At the moment of his arrest, Saddam Jaradat was at a barbershop for men which the Israeli soldiers raided in order to arrest him and take him to Salem military camp, which is located one kilometre west of the village.Since his arrest, we have not heard from or anything about Saddam Jaradat. The Israeli soldiers said that they arrested him because he was charged with throwing stones against the iron fence and at the Israeli military patrols, which are continuously present behind the Wall in the vicinity of the village. I wonder if that gives the Israeli soldiers the right to arrest children and move them to the Israeli prisons and detention centres under difficult and harsh circumstances.
