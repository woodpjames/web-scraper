Affidavit No. 4919/2009
2009
My name is Saleh Muhammad Mahmoud al-Zmara. I am a farmer, 66 years old, married, and the father of seven children: five boys and two daughters. I live on al-Nafaq Street in al-Tuffah neighbourhood near al-Hilal Sports Clubs east of Gaza city. I own a piece of land measuring 4,500 square metres, which is located on the Abu-Ramadan orchard “Damra land” north of the town of Beit Hanoun, in the northern Gaza Strip. My land is located at a distance of approximately 800 metres from the northern border between the Gaza Strip and the 1948 territory, which is under the control of the Israeli occupying forces.About 6:10 pm on Wednesday, 3 June 2009, I was working on my land as usual. I was harvesting the wheat crops with my brother ‘Ali, 63 years old as well as 15 people whom I hired to cultivate the land. I was surprised when all of a sudden the occupying soldiers opened intensive fire on us from behind the Wall. I sustained a bullet wound in my left hand and my brother in his back. My horse, which I use to cultivate and plough my land, also sustained a bullet wound in the face. The occupying soldiers continued to fire at us heavily. As a result of the shooting, the hay caught fire and an estimated 1,900 Jordanian Dinars worth of wheat crop burnt to the ground.Several days ago, the occupying forces dropped flyers on the Border Line in Beit Hanoun, warning citizens not to approach the Border Line and to keep a distance of at least 300 metres. My brother, workers, and I ran away in fear that someone else may be injured. My brother ‘Ali and I reached ‘Ali’s car and drove to Beit Hanoun Hospital.Having received first medical aid, we were transported to Kamal ‘Udwan Hospital in Beit Lahiya. My brother and I had surgery, which lasted for about two hours respectively. We also received other necessary medical attention. I stayed at the hospital for four days and then returned to my house.
