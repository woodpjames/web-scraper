Affidavit No. 2375/2005
2005
I work in  the old town of Hebron on the rehabilitation of the house of late  Yousef al-Sharabati, which is located beside the small settlement known  as Abraham Avino. The settlers had seized the Sharabati house by force  and ruined it. Currently, I and nine others are working on the  rehabilitation and repair of this house through the Hebron  Reconstruction Committee. During our work which started approximately  two months ago (in March 2005), we are subjected on a daily basis to the  throwing of stones, garbage and empty bottles and sound bombs by the  settlers. These settlers who are mainly girls of ages 14-16 throw these  things from the windows of their homes in the settlement or from the  roof of their building which is six floors high. I know these girls  because they repeatedly throw stones, garbage and bottles on the workers  who are working on the repair of al-Sharabati house.At  approximately 11:00 a.m on Thursday 26 May 2005, while I was doing  repair work on the house, stones were thrown on me. One of the stones  directly hit my head. I felt dizzy and had severe pain. I fell down on  the ground and shouted. A soldier was nearby and saw what had happened.  Then the Israeli army came and one of the soldiers gave me first aid  because I was bleeding heavily. After five minutes a military ambulance  arrived and offered me first aid. I stayed in this ambulance for 15  minutes until an ambulance of the Palestinian Red Crescent Society came  and took me to Hebron Governmental Hospital where I received six  stitches. I would like to mention that I have been hit with stones  several times on different parts of my body but I have never been as  severely injured as I was this time.This is my declaration and hereby I sign, 28 May 2005Signature: Majed Zuheir
