Affidavit No. 2031/2004
2004
At around 6:00 p.m. 6 September 2004,  the Israeli army besieged my home where I live with mynine-member  family. I am married from Ahmad 'Isa Naji 'Amr, 58 years old. We own a  buildingnear our home that consists of three floors and a basement,  inhabited by four families. Thesoldiers asked orally us to enter the  building, and at first my husband refused. But after theythreatened to  use force, my husband opened the door for them. Their presence lasted  until 23September 2004. During this time, we were subjected to thorough  searches when we movedfrom one apartment to another.Moreover,  from time to time they opened fire on the cars and passersby, because  our house ison the main road between Dora and Hebron. Also during their  presence in the house, theyurinated in glass bottles and threw them in  front of our home, adjacent to the building that theyoccupied. And many  times they used plastic bags for their stool and threw these bags at  theentrance of our home. We complained to the officer about these acts,  only once did the soldierscollect their garbage. The soldiers left on 23  September 2004, at 1:00 a.m., without giving usany military order that  they used our home. After their departure, we found the fourth floor to  befull of garbage, and they still haven’t returned our keys that they  took when they used thebuilding. This was the first time that the  Israeli soldiers used our building, but we do not know ifit is the last  and only time.This is my declaration and hereby I sign, on 28 October 2004Signature: Rasmiyya Khalil Abu-'Amr
