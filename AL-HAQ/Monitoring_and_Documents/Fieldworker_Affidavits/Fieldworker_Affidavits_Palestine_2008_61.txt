Affidavit No. 4396/2008
2008
At about 7:30 am on Monday, 28 July 2008, my wife, Majida ‘Abd-al-Latif Ja'afra, 24 years old, was about to give birth. I borrowed a Subaru car from a friend of mine to transport my wife to the Hebron Public Hospital ('Alia Hospital). When I arrived at the overpass leading to the town of Beit Kahel on the outskirts of the Hebron city, I was shocked to see it closed with a dirt barricade by the Israeli army. The overpass is the regular road in which we travel on to access the city of Hebron.Then, I decided to travel to the town of Halhoul in order to access Hebron. As I shifted my direction, I met two drivers who told me that the road to Halhoul was also closed. At that point, I decided to return to the dirt barricade on the overpass to the town of Beit Kahel. Because the road to the dirt barricade was overcrowded, it took me much time to reach it. There, I called the Palestinian Red Crescent Society to send an ambulance transport my wife to hospital. The ambulance arrived at about 9:00 pm.However, Ten minutes before the ambulance arrived, my wife had given birth in the car. My mother and mother-in-law who were in our company helped my wife deliver the baby. My wife gave birth to a baby boy. We named him Layth. In about ten minutes, medics offered first aid treatment to my wife and baby. Then, they carried them on a stretcher over the dirt barricade to the ambulance. At about 9:30 pm, we arrived at the Hebron Public Hospital. There, medical examinations were conducted on my wife and baby. Both were in good health. I should note that the road from my house to Hebron Public Hospital usually takes about half an hour in normal circumstances. The overpass to the town of Beit Kahel was closed with a dirt barricade abruptly, and so was the road to the town of Halhoul. Three days after my wife gave birth to our baby, both roads were open again.
