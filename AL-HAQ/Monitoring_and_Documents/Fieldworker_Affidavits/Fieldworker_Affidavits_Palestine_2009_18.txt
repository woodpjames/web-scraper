Affidavit No. 5119/2009
2009
I live in a two-storey house in the Zuqaq al-Masarwa neighbourhood, which is located near the main roundabout in the centre of the city of Jenin. My brother Bassam „Abdallah „Ubeid, who is 45 years old, married and father of eight children, lives on the first floor. My wife, three children, and I live on the second floor.“I will visit you again.” Captain Ayyoub told me in a threatening tone.When we returned to our house, we saw that some of the contents were destroyed because the soldiers had searched the houses in a brutal and savage manner. Later, I went to the Jenin Governmental Hospital and received necessary treatment. Because the Israeli occupying soldiers beat me, I sustained contusions in the left leg and chest as well as scratches on the left hand. I should note that I suffer from heart disease.
