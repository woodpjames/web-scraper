Affidavit No. 5106/2009
2009
At around 12:10 am on Monday, 19 October 2009, my colleagues and I concluded a wedding party for the Labad family on al-Yarmouk Street in al-Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood north of Gaza city. We loaded musical instruments and equipment and climbed into our yellow Volkswagen car in order to return to our houses. Having travelled along al-Yarmouk Street for a distance of almost 150 metres, we were surprised by a dark blue Volkswagen Golf car obstructing our way. I saw five masked individuals wearing black uniforms and armed with Kalashnikov rifles and pistols leave their car and approach us, pointing their weapons at our car. A masked individual hit our driver Zuheir Abu-Samra on his head and seized the car key from him. Other masked individuals opened the car door and I heard an individual ask for my brother Khaled.
