Sworn StatementAfter having been warned to tell the truth and nothing but the truth or else I shall be subjected to penal action, I, the undersigned, Mukhlis Naim Hafeth Maseed, of Palestinian nationality, holder of ID No. 935970343, born on 25 February 1975, a farmer, and a resident of Khirbet Yarza, Tubas governorate, would like to declare the following:Khirbet Yarza is a very small village located to the east of Tubas city in the area of the Jordan Valley. This small village is about 9 kilometers away from Tubas, with a small population of at about 60 people. The Palestinian inhabitants of Yarza make their living from livestock and agriculture, while they live either in houses built of brick and cement, or in tents made of steel slides.Yarza is continuously subjected to the demolition of property by Israeli occupying forces under the excuse of lack of building permits. This is what happened recently:At about 9:00 pm, the Israeli occupying forces left the area. There were no clashes between the people of Yarza and these forces. This was the third time in this year that the Israeli occupying forces demolished the Yarza mosque due to the lack of building permit; the mosque was demolished for the first time on 25 November 2010, then on 17 February 2011 it was subject to demolition and sabotage, and for the third time on 11 October 2011. This is the one and only mosque in Khirbet Yarza.We suffer from repeated raids, demolitions and acts of sabotage against our property. We did not receive any warning before the most recent demolition. It took place suddenly and quickly.This is my declaration and hereby I sign, 13 October 2011
