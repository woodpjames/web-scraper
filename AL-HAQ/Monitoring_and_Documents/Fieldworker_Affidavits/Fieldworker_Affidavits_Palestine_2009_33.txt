Affidavit No. 5007/2009
2009
I live in the town of al-Sila al-Harithiyya, West of Jenin City. I am married to Falastin „Abd-al-Razeq Jaradat, 26-years-old, and am the father of four children: Hiba 12-years-old, Yafa 11-years-old, Tawalba six-years-old, and Anas, who was born on 8 May 2007. Anas is now two–years- old.The last time the Israeli authorities refused applications for my wife and I was on Thursday, 16 July 2009. Again, we were denied access to al-Maqased Hospital in order to conduct the necessary medical examinations to determine his condition and prescribe treatment.I was arrested and detained by the Israeli occupying authorities three years ago (from 2003 through 2006) under administrative detention (arrest without charge or trial). Nevertheless, this is not an excuse to deny a child access to health care facilities. I am afraid that if this situation persists I will lose my son. I need to be able to access al-Maqased Hospital in order to conduct necessary examinations and identify the proper treatment for my son Anas.
