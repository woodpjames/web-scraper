Affidavit No. 4530/2008
2008
At about 2:00 pm on Tuesday, 2 December 2008, I was sitting with my friends ‘Umar Mousa Hammad, who is 15 years old and Hani 'Awwad Abu-Sheiban, also 15 years old, as well as with my cousin Ramzi Ibrahim al-Duheini, who is 16 years old. We were present near my house along the road leading to Gaza International Airport, about 700 metres east of Salah al-Din Street and about 2,000 metres away from the Israeli border fence in the town of al-Shoka south east of the city of Rafah.I heard the sound of an Israeli reconnaissance aircraft, which patrolled the skies over the area for almost ten minutes. Suddenly, I heard a sound approaching us. It was like the sound of a whistling tin sheet when it falls from an elevated place. As it was close to us, it produced a noise and was followed by a very strong explosion in the area where we were present. I felt like I was pushed for several metres away from my place. I also sensed that I was injured. I lost consciousness for a while. After I regained consciousness, I saw my friends lying on the ground at a few metres away from me. Their bodies were torn into pieces and bled heavily.I started to yell and scream for help. Meanwhile, a number of youths, whom I thought were residents of the neighbourhood, came and transported me and my friends to another place. About 15 minutes later, an ambulance arrived to the area. It transported me and my friends to Abu-Yousef al-Najjar Hospital, which is approximately 1,500 metres west of the area. There, preliminary examinations were conducted on me. Then, I was transported to the Gaza European Hospital in the city of Khan Younes. I sustained shrapnel wounds in various parts of my body. My right index finger was amputated. To date, I still receive medical treatment at the hospital.
