Affidavit No. 5464/2010
2010
On 20 May 2010, I was asked to report to the Preventive Security agency of the Salfit Directorate at 9:00 am. Responding to their request on 22 May 2010 at 9:00 am, I went to the Preventive Security directorate in Salfit. I waited for the interview for almost five hours, during which time I was detained along with a couple of other people. At around 2:00 pm on that day, I entered the interrogation room and was asked about policies that Hamas intends to implement during the upcoming local elections. However, I did not have any information about this. The interrogation lasted for several minutes. Thereafter, the interrogator told me to get out to the outer yard and wait there. Almost two hours later, I was called to be interrogated once again. Another security officer questioned me about the same topic.I have been going to the Preventive Security offices everyday ever since in response to their daily requests that I come in to be interrogated. The routine has been that after I present my ID card, they hold me in the yard outside the Preventive Security offices from 9:00 am until around 8:00 pm. However, they do not ask me any questions or interrogate me. My daily business is being disrupted just for the sake of punishing me.I should note that in 2008 I was also summoned once a week and detained at the Preventive Security offices from 9:00 am until about 7:00 pm without being interrogated. That incident lasted for approximately four months.
