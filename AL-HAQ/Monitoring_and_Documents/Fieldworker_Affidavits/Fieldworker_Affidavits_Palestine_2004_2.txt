Affidavit No. 2111/2004
2004
For this  reason I will always live in confusion, because I was not able to see my  mother beforeher death due to the oppression of the Israeli occupation,  which also deprived us of the land ofour husbands and families, though  our land became available for anybody claiming that he/sheis Jewish. On  the other hand, and most painful for me, is that my children are not  allowed to goout of Qalqiliya because their permits are expired. We  cannot live like other citizens, even in ourbesieged homeland. Imagine  that my daughters are university students and because they donot hold  identity cards, they cannot study in any university outside Qalqiliya  and therefore theyare obliged to study in al-Quds Open University.Moreover,  my daughter Vala was proposed to by many men, but she refused to marry  becauseshe is a refugee in her homeland and does not want her husband  and children to live the bitterlife she is passing through. Worse yet,  my son Fadi is dumb and deaf, and I am unable to takehim to a doctor  outside Qalqiliya because we do not hold identity cards. Imagine that my  sonneeds treatment, but due to the lack of the official permits, we  cannot move. This matter is verydifficult for us and we do not know what  to do or where to go in order to solve our problems thatresult from the  occupation. Despite these difficult circumstances and the restrictions  on ourmovement, especially on my children, the occupation oppressed them  once again when it killedtheir father in Qalqiliya in November 2002  while he was performing his duty at the nationalSecurity Barrier. It is  not a surprise if I tell you that our tragic life is hell due to the  circumstanceswe are undergoing.This is my declaration and hereby I sign, on 27 December 2004Signature: Faten Najib Yousef Shweiri
