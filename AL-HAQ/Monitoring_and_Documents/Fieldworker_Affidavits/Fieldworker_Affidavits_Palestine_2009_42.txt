Affidavit No. 5055/2009
2009
At a distance of 200 metres south of my land, we stepped out of the car and walked so that Israeli troops positioned behind the border would not open fire or think that we were members of the Palestinian resistance. We all got out of the car and proceeded on foot towards the land. As we walked, the children played together, and I pointed out the area of my land and the surrounding lands to my friends.Having walked for 100 metres north, I saw a green Israeli Hummer jeep leave the border and head towards us at a high speed. We were all scared. We walked slowly back to the car so that we could leave before the jeep could approach and hurt anyone. At a distance of 450 metres from us, Israeli occupying soldiers opened fire on us. We ran towards the car, seeking protection from the bullets being fired. We all climbed into the car. I tried to start it, but I could not. Then, the soldiers stopped shooting.“Dad! My brother Ghazi has been hit.” My son Ahmad told me.I got out of the car and saw my son Ghazi lying on the ground at a distance of about 100 metres away. He had been running ahead of us because he was frightened of the shooting from the Israeli soldiers. I hurried to see Ghazi and checked him. He had sustained a bullet wound in the back of his head. I saw a hole where blood was flowing heavily.I do not know why the Israeli army opened fire on us and killed Ghazi in cold blood and did not show mercy on his childhood. We were civilians and the children were in our company. We had been walking in an ordinary manner to visit our land.
