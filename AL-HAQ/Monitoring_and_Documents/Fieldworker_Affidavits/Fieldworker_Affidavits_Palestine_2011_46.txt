Affidavit No.6407/2011
2011
My name is Muhammad Jaser Husein Abu-Mustafa, a resident of al-Mu’askar al-Gharbi area in Khan Younes. I am 21 years old and a student at al-Azhar University. On Sunday 15 May 2011 at around 2:00 pm, I went with some of my friends to ‘Abasan al-Jadida area to participate in the activities organized in commemoration of the Catastrophe (Nakba). I joined the demonstration that was set to head towards the border east of ‘Abasan al-Jadida. There were around 150-200 demonstrators - all civilian - some of whom were carrying Palestinian flags and banners. They were chanting slogans in support of the right of return and liberation. I stood with the rest of the demonstrators at approximately 300 meters away from the border, while some others proceeded towards the border.Along the border, I noticed an Israeli military guard tower made out of concrete blocks.Moments later, I heard the sounds of gunfire and saw protesters running away westwards. I tried to run myself, but after a few meters I felt that I had been shot in my right leg. I instantly fell to the ground and was unable to move. Then, a number of protesters gathered around me and carried me for about a hundred meters. They were running as they were carrying me. In the process, I was dropped several times as gunfire continued. I was then transported by motorcycle for a short distance before reaching an ambulance that had arrived to the scene. I was taken to the European Gaza Hospital where my injuries were treated. It turned out that I had been hit by a bullet in my right leg and that it had penetrated my bones. An external platinum bridge was installed in my leg. I am still at the hospital receiving treatment.
