Affidavit No. 6105/2011
2011
At around 9:30 am on Wednesday, 23 February 2011, I was collecting the remaining carrot harvest and putting it in a horse cart in the land of Abu-Samra northwest of Beit Lahiya in the Northern Gaza governorate. I was located at a distance of about 700 metres from the Northern border. I usually collect the remaining crops from Abu-Samra’s land and sell them to merchants who would use them to feed livestock and animals. At the very best, I would earn ILS 20 – 30 and use the money to support my wife and two children.As I was collecting crops on the aforementioned date, Israeli soldiers positioned on watchtowers behind the border opened fire on me. I immediately felt something hit my left foot and I became dizzy and fell on the ground. I saw blood gush out of my left foot. Some people passing by stopped and carried me on the horse cart and headed southwards, out of the area. An ambulance arrived to the location where they had carried me to and transported me to Kamal ‘Udwan Hospital in Beit Lahiya. As soon as I arrived there, doctors offered me first aid and told me that I had been hit by a bullet in my left foot and that the bullet shrapnel was still inside my foot. Doctors cleansed the wound in order to remove the shrapnel and plant a platinum device in the left foot so as to mend the bone fractures.I am still at the Hospital receiving medical treatment and I am unable to move. I do not know why the occupying forces opened fire on me. I was far away from the border despite and was working in a very calm atmosphere.
