Affidavit No. 5438/2010
2010
My name is Hasan Khaled Hasan Abu-Warda. I am 17 years old, single, and live with my family in our house on Ahmad Fikri Street near al-Qatati Mosque in Jabalya al-Nazla area in the Northern Gaza governorate. To make a living and help my unemployed father provide for our family, I collect stones from the area of al-Muharrarat (former Israeli settlements) in Northern Gaza and sell them to merchants to be used for construction purposes.At around 6:30 am on Saturday, 22 May 2010, my fellow workers and I were collecting stones in the Erez Industrial Zone north of the Gaza Strip. We were at a distance of approximately 400 metres from the Israeli border when Israeli troops, who were positioned in military watchtowers along the Separation Fence, opened fire on us. As a result, I sustained a bullet wound in my right foot and fell on the ground. Blood gushed out up to my knee. My fellow workers arrived and carried me out of the area. One of them called an ambulance, which arrived 10 minutes later and transported me to Kamal ‘Adawan Hospital in Beit Lahiya. After I reached the hospital, the doctors gave me first aid and said that I had sustained a bullet wound that had an entry and an exit. I had to have a surgical operation after which my right foot was put in a cast. I will also need to have another surgical operation. As for now, I am staying at the hospital for medical attention.
