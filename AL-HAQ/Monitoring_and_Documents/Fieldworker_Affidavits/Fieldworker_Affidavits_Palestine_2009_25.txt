Affidavit No. 4976/2009
2009
Our families were detained for almost five hours. Later, soldiers began to withdraw gradually from the house. As they were leaving, I realised that dozens of soldiers had been dispersed inside and around our homes.On their way out, some soldiers demanded that my brother „Ayyad stand up. They tied his hands behind his back with plastic handcuffs, blindfolded him with a piece of cloth, and took him out to the main street. „Ayyad is about 48 years of age.To this day the Israeli army continues to hold my brother, Muhammad-Akram, in detention at Kfar „Etzion Detention Centre.
