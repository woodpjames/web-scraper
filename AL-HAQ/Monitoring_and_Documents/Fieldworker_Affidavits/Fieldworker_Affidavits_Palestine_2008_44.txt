Affidavit No. 4347/2008
2008
On 30 July 2008, residents of my village of Ni'lin marched in the funeral procession of 10-year-old Ahmad Husam Mousa, who had sustained a fatal bullet wound on the day before. On the day of the funeral, several confrontations took place between the village  residents and Israeli occupying troops. At about 6:30 pm on 30 July 2008, a demonstration took place in the village centre. I was watching what was going on there with Yousef Ahmad ‘Amira, 17 years old, and other youths. We sought protection between two houses. Confrontations took place in more than one area. We were approximately 150 metres away from soldiers, who fired tear gas grenades and rubber-coated steel bullets.A green military jeep with red licence plates belonging to the so-called Border Guard arrived. When I saw the hood of the jeep, I was only one metre away from Yousef. Immediately, the jeep drove back to the same area where it had come from, to the eastern entrance to the village. At that same moment, I saw Yousef fall to the ground. Blood gushed heavily from him head. As I put a piece of cloth on his head. I saw two wounds. I was astonished. A number of youths came along and lifted him. As I was in shock, I went home. Later, I learned from youths that Yousef had sustained two rubber-coated steel bullet wounds to the head and that he was in a coma.
