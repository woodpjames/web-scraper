Affidavit No. 5205/2009
2009
I watched what was going on and looked at my watch from time to time. Nasr was beaten from 6:35 pm to 6:45 pm. Then, about ten Israeli jeeps and an armoured personnel carrier arrived and spread out around the area. A number of the soldiers who had just arrived also beat Nasr, who screamed of pain. During this time, the soldiers and athletes continued to detain the father on the sidewalk, opposite that on which his son was detained.
