Affidavit No. 2631/2005
2005
On  Saturday 1 October 2005, I was in my agricultural land located seven  kilometres west of my village, Kufr al-Labad in the Toulkarem  Governorate. At 7:00 am, I was picking olive trees on my land, which is  around 30 dunums. I was surprised by three young men wearing civil  uniforms, carrying weapons, and wearing yarmulkes on their heads. I  realized that they were settlers. I was shocked when I saw them running  toward me from the south where the Avni Havits settlement is located at  four kilometres away from my land.When the  three settlers were close to me, one of them started to talk to me while  the other two were aiming their weapons at me. That settler (who talked  to me) was in his thirties, bald, and spoke Arabic with a heavy accent.  He asked me, "What are you doing here?" and I told him that I was  picking olives. At that moment, he came closer to me, held my shirt, and  tore it. Then he grabbed my pants, pulled them down, and also tore them  while the other two settlers stood guard beside him. The same settler  said, "I don't want to see you here again."Meanwhile,  one of the other two settlers approached me and asked for my ID (in  broken Arabic, too) and I gave it to him. He took it and tore it and  threw it on the ground even without looking at it and asked me to leave  my land by saying, “You have an hour – if we come back and find you  here, we are going to kill you.” The threat was serious. The three  settlers then left in the direction of the Avni Havits settlement. Out  of horror and fear, I quickly returned back to my village.The next  day, I returned with two of my friends to my land. For two days, I  picked my olive trees with my friends’ help. Since then I have not been  able to return to my land. The settlers of Avni Havits prevent us from  approaching our lands which surround that settlement. As a result, we  lose our olive crops every year.
