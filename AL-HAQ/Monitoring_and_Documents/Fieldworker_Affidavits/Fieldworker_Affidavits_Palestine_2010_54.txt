Affidavit No. 5336/2010
2010
At around 11:00 am on 20 March 2010, I was present with dozens of young men near an uninhabited house about 30 to 40 metres east of „Iraq Bourin village. We were throwing stones at approximately 30 soldiers from the Israeli army, who were positioned at a distance of about 100 metres east of our location. Over a period of two hours, the soldiers, who were wearing standard military uniforms and carrying long weapons, responded by occasionally firing tear gas and sound grenades as well as rubber-coated steel bullets towards us. No one was reported wounded.An hour or more later, a friend of mine told me that Muhammad was martyred at the Nablus Specialist Hospital. „Usayd, who was at the same hospital, was in a very critical condition.I can confirm that the bullets I mentioned above were the only ones which were fired by the said soldier towards „Usayd and Muhammad. It should be noted that stones were not thrown at the moment the bullets were fired. Furthermore, I did not see Muhammad or „Usayd take part in throwing the stones.
