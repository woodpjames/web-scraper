Affidavit No. 4988/2009
2009
When we reached a checkpoint belonging to the police agency of the Hamas government on the al-Jamarek junction leading to the Beit Hanoun (Erez) Crossing, a number of armed police officers impeded our access and ordered us to stop the car and step down. A police officer requested that my colleagues and I present our ID cards and passports. During this time, other police officers searched the car as well as our luggage and personal belongings. The police officers then ordered us to stand beside the car.The police officers also called someone who arrived an hour later and introduced himself as a member of the Internal Security agency. He seized our ID cards and passports and ordered us to return to our houses. He also told us that we were barred from travelling and taking part in the Fateh Sixth Conference. According to police lists we would be denied from departing the Gaza Strip and participating in the Conference. Furthermore, the officer told us to report to the Internal Security agency without stating any reasons. We returned to our homes.At around 11:00 pm on the same day, I was served a summons to report to the Internal Security headquarters in the governorate of Northern Gaza.
