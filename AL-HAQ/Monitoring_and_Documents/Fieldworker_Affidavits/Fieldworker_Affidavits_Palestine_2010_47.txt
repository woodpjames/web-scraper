Affidavit No. 5307/2010
2010
“How are you?” He asked me in Hebrew, which I understood.“Fine.” I answered.The soldier demanded that everyone in the car present his or her ID card, which I collected and gave to him. Of course, I had turned on the internal light of the car so that the soldier and others could clearly see the interior of the car.Whilst the soldier was examining the ID cards, we suddenly heard a noise and intensive shooting being directed at us. I did not see how many soldiers opened fire, but I estimated that it was all of them because it was intensive. I estimated that the shooting lasted for a period of two minutes at first. After stopping for a short time, the soldiers resumed fire for another two minutes.The soldier who took our ID cards was the closest to me, but I could not see his face. According to my estimation, the incident lasted only 20 minutes.I do not know why the soldiers opened fire on us. I have not yet seen my car, but those who have say that approximately 100 bullets had hit it. I also do not know how many bullets wounds Thabet had sustained.
