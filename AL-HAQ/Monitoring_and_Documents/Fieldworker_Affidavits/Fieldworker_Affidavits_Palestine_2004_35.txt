Affidavit No.1615/2004
2004
On 18  October 2003, at around 1:00, while I was working in the vegetable  market near the Jamal Abdul Nasser circle in the middle of the city of  Tulkarem, I saw a crowd of people running. When I asked of the reason  they were running, they told me that Israeli military jeeps had entered  the town. At that point I heard shooting and then saw the shop owners  closing up their shops and leaving their houses. I also closed down the  shop that I was working in and I remained nearby.As I was  looking into the alley in the vegetable market that is nearby the Jamal  Abdul Nasser circle, I saw three Israeli military jeeps nearby that  circle with the word “police” written on the side of one of them. I also  saw a group of boys throwing stones and the like towards those jeeps.  The Israeli patrols were 60 metres away from me towards the west, while  the boys were less than ten metres away. I stole glances at the soldiers  in the alley and at the boys who were throwing stones at them and then  would hide. Suddenly at around 1:30 pm of the same day, while I was  watching the army, I saw two Israeli soldiers come up from behind the  jeeps. One of them lay on the floor on his stomach and aimed his gun  towards the boys who were standing at the end of the alley.At that  point, I pulled myself back. Immediately afterwards, the soldiers shot  in our direction, as a result of which one of the boys fell to the  ground. He started bleeding from his neck and chest. Some of the other  boys picked him up and carried him and started running to Tulkarem  Hospital, which is nearby. Then the Israeli military patrols left the  area. In less than half an hour, I learned that that boy was called  Yahya Rihan and was a resident of Shufeh Farm in the suburbs of  Tulkarem. I also knew that he had become a martyr. In addition, the  Israeli army did not impose curfew on Tulkarem during that time, left  the area and did not return in that same day.Date: 1July 2004
