Affidavit No. 5521/2010
2010
My husband „Isam „Abd-al-Rahman Yousef Shalabi, 51 years old, is the headmaster of Al-Iman School and Kindergarten which is owned by the Zakat Committee. At around 12:00 pm on 4 May 2010, my husband was detained by Palestinian Intelligence officers.The Intelligence officers literally told me: “There are no visits to „Isam Shalabi because the Director of the Intelligence Agency does not allow them.”On 14 June 2010, lawyer Fadel Bushnaq from Jenin managed to obtain an order from the Palestinian High Court of Justice which stated that my husband should be released. However, the decision has not yet been implemented and we do not know why. The Intelligence agency neglected the decision; they usually ignore and refuse to execute orders and decisions issued by the highest Palestinian judicial body. If human rights and humanitarian organisations do not take action to force the intelligence agency to release my husband, he will continue to be detained on political grounds without any clear or definite charges against him. My husband has not taken part in any political activities. His sole concern is his work and supporting his family in Jenin refugee camp. My husband provides support to our seven-member family as well as his elderly, handicapped mother, who has been crying everyday and requests to see her son „Isam Shalabi.
