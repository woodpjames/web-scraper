Affidavit No. 2795/2006
2006
On 24 January 2006, I was with my husband Yousef and our family that consists of Ahmad (16 years), Walid (14 years), Ibrahim (11 years), and Shayma’ (11 years). We were all sleeping in our home located in Rafidiya quarter in Nablus city. At 1:30 am, we heard loud movement in front of our home. The noise was coming from the south, near the supermarket located on the ground floor of our building. My husband and I went to the balcony of our bedroom which overlooks the supermarket and the main street to the south of our building.Suddenly, I heard my husband arguing with a number of people. The argument was about removing the photos of a candidate in the legislative elections, Ghassan al-Shak'a, from the wall of the supermarket. In less than five minutes, the youths with whom my husband was arguing opened heavy and intensive fire on our home. My children got up and started screaming. I went to their bedroom and brought them to another room. My husband went to our bedroom, got his pistol and tried to use it, but the pistol did not work and all the bullets fell out.After five minutes, and while my husband was still on the balcony, the firing stopped. I called out to him and saw that his head was bent forward. I called him many times but he did not answer, so I went to the balcony. When I got there, I discovered that he was bleeding. I yelled and shouted until our relatives and neighbours came and carried him to Rafidiya hospital. The hospital is only one kilometre from our home. Less than ten minutes after reaching the hospital, my husband died. All medical efforts had failed to save his life.As for the perpetrators, they ran away, leaving only their crime behind. This is one phenomenon of the security chaos prevailing in Nablus; namely, the killing of innocent people while the criminals go unpunished.This is my declaration and hereby I sign, 14 February 2006Signature: Zakiyya Hassouna
