Affidavit No. 5517/2010
2010
I am a resident of Nour Shams refugee camp near Toulkarem. The camp houses around 6,000 residents. I suffer from severe back pain. Since the end of 2005, I have been forced to move back and forth between Nour Shams refugee camp and Nablus city for medical treatment in hospitals there. The Israeli military checkpoints set up along the road connecting the cities of Toulkarem and Nablus are adding on to my suffering. There are two permanent military checkpoints set up on the main road between the two cities: the „Einav checkpoint near the town of „Anabta, on which five to seven soldiers are stationed, and Beit Iba checkpoint west of Nablus city which has around six soldiers stationed there as well.Each time I need to visit another Palestinian city to receive medical treatment, I undergo harsh psychological stress because of the Israeli military checkpoints on the roads. I have to wait for extended hours in order to cross the checkpoints. This is a process that intensifies my back pain and further deteriorates my health condition in general. What I suffer at these military checkpoints is also suffered by thousands of Palestinian citizens when they travel from one city or village to another. These checkpoints are a nightmare for Palestinians and they make it difficult for them to access health facilities, educational institutions or their workplaces. The occupying soldiers stationed at these checkpoints use all and different techniques of searching. They delay Palestinians with the intention to insult our dignity and humanity and to make life more difficult.
