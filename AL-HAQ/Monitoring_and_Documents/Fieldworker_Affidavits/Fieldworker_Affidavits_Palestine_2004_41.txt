Affidavit No. 1810/2004
2004
At  around 10:15 am, on 20 May, 2004, while I was working on duty as a nurse  in the UNRWA clinic of al-Fawwar Refugee Camp, a civil car arrived, not  an ambulance, and it was carrying an injured person in it. An ambulance  was parked in our camp, because Dr. Abdul Karim Hashem Awad and the  driver Yasser Mish’al, both workers in the UNRWA, had come by it. When I  looked at the injured, I knew him at once since he was our neighbour  and his name was Islam Hussniyeh.After I  examined him, I realised his head injury in the head was fatal, because  it seemed that the bullet had penetrated his face from the side of his  right eye, next to the right eye, and out from his head causing an  explosion in his head. I transferred the injured to the ambulance at  once and we hurried him to Hebron’s Governmental Hospital, he passed  away before reaching the hospital, actually even before leaving the  camp, because his brain was practically out.I  returned to the camp after approximately half an hour and then another  injury reached the clinic and it was Mahmoud Al-Khatib and he was 15  years old, the schoolmate of the martyr. He was suffering from injuries  in his face caused by the pieces of the skull of the martyr after he was  shot. He had cuts from these bone pieces in his face and he was given  aid. The martyr was buried in the camp’s graveyard for the martyrs at  noon the same day. And according to affidavits of eye-witnesses, who had  spoken to me, they stated that he had not been throwing stones during  the time of his injury at all, and that a group of children and him were  keeping surveillance to the movement of soldiers in the camp and  shouting at them. Besides, the distance between the soldiers and the  young men was around 60 metres and the soldiers were located in the  higher level of the road in the camp.Date: 26 May 2004
