Affidavit No. 2364/2005
2005
At 8:00  in the evening on 24 May 2005 while I was at home, a number of young men  wearing civil uniforms broke into our home and claimed that they were  from the Palestinian Preventive Security Forces and that they wanted to  arrest my son Muwafaq. Without resisting, my son accompanied them. He  was charged with theft and released on bail provided by his brother. He  was then arrested again and his arrest was normal. On Wednesday 25 May  2005, I went to the premises of the Palestinian Preventive Security  Forces in Ramallah al-Tahta (Old City of Ramallah) but there I was  denied a meeting with him. I tried again on Saturday 28 May 2005 and  again I was denied a meeting with him. The same evening, my son called  me and told me that he had been moved to the premises of the Ramallah  Police.On 29 May  2005, I went there to visit my son. He told me about the torture he was  subjected to. He showed me his hands from which flesh had been removed  by pincers. I also saw marks of torture on his back. He told me that he  was subjected to torture several times. According to my son, no serious  investigation of him has taken place and he was taken to al-Sheikh Zayed  Hospital on the same day of his arrest as a result of the severe  beating he was subjected to. On 30 May 2005, I obtained a medical report  from al-Sheikh Zayed Hospital. Until now, my son is still detained in  the Ramallah Police Station in 'Ein Misbah and he has not been brought  before any court concerning the extension of his detention period.  Nobody visited him except me and during my visits to him, he looked  tired and severely beaten. I fear for his life. As I mentioned earlier  his detention is on the basis of robbery. It is worth noting that when  he was arrested the Preventive Forces members did not show any arrest  warrant or notice of summons.This is my declaration and hereby I sign, 30 May 2005Signature: Khamis Dar 'Awwad
