Affidavit No. 5215/2009
2009
I work as the Director of the French Associated Press office and Secretary of the Palestinian Journalists Association in Gaza. I am 44 years old and live in the al-Rimal neighbourhood in the centre of the Gaza city.Thereafter, I received a telephone call from the Government Media Office in Gaza. I was summoned to report to the Office at around 1:00 pm on the same day so that officers could inquire about the conference supervisors. The officers in charge at the Office informed me that the IFJ conference would be prevented because it had not obtained a permit. As they said, coordination did not take place with the Government Media Office.
