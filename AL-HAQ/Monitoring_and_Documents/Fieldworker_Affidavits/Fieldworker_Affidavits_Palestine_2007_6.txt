Affidavit No. 3347/2007
2007
At approximately 8:00 am on Monday, 22 January 2007, I left my house, which is located in Sour Baher, and walked towards the house of Mahmoud al-A'mas. His house is located close to mine. Upon seeing a very large number of Israeli military jeeps parked close to the grave yard near his house, I realised that the Jerusalem Municipality intended to demolish his house.While on the way from my house to Mahmoud al-A'mas' house, I saw roughly 80 police, border police and special squad officers closing the road. The soldiers were wearing the green uniform of the Israeli border police, while the police were wearing the blue uniforms. The special squads were wearing their grey military uniforms. I know from previous occasions that the special squads wear this uniform. All of the police, as well as the soldiers, were carrying weapons.While I was on my way to the house, ten special squad officers in grey uniforms blocked my path and informed me in Hebrew that I had to go back. They said that it was prohibited to pass down the road. Before I could ask them for further information, the soldiers forcefully pushed me backwards. Some of them, in order to force me to move back, beat me all over my body with their batons.Then, I saw several civilians - I cannot recall exactly how many - gather around me. The soldiers started pushing them backwards using batons. I also saw a soldier, who was wearing a green uniform and was carrying a gun, beating a man of about 20 years of age with a baton. This soldier forced us to move backwards and to stand in an area that overlooks the house from the other side.I saw two huge yellow bulldozers approaching from the main road located to the north of the house. I do not know what make the bulldozers were as I cannot read English, but I can attest that this was the first time I saw bulldozers of this size. I then saw the bulldozers demolishing the house of Mahmoud al-A'mas, which consisted of four floors.
