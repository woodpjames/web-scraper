Sworn StatementAfter having been warned to tell the truth and nothing but the truth or else I shall be subjected to penal action, I, the undersigned, ‘Abd-al-Karim ‘Izat Ibrahim Dar Jaber, of Palestinian nationality, holder of ID No. 852528330, born on 12 March 1992, a worker, and a resident of the ‘Aboud village, Ramallah governorate, would like to declare the following:At around 1:00 pm on Friday, 11 May 2012, I joined participants in a peaceful demonstration that was organised in solidarity with prisoners, who had declared a hunger strike in Israeli prisons. We marched from the centre of the village towards the settler bypass road, which connects settlements in the area surrounding Ramallah to Tel Aviv. A military jeep was positioned near the village’s junction that leads to the bypass road. As soon as they saw us, soldiers started to fire tear gas and sound grenades as well as rubber-coated steel bullets towards us. There were approximately 50 of us, including youths, men and children.At around 3:30 pm, I was surprised by a soldier who appeared from behind support walls near the road junction. I was at a distance of about five metres from him. He fired six rubber-coated steel bullets at me, wounding me in the waist and legs. After I fell on the ground, four soldiers surrounded me and attempted to arrest me. Some young men, however, withdrew and took me away. A private car transported me to a health care centre in the village, which transferred me to the Ramallah hospital. An ambulance arrived 15 minutes after I had been wounded. It transported me to Ramallah Governmental Hospital (Ramallah Medical Complex). It appeared that I had sustained contusions in my right hand because I had fallen on the ground. I also sustained contusions in my waist and legs because of the rubber-coated steel bullets. I am now in hospital and receiving medical treatment.This is my declaration, which I hereby sign, 12 May 2012
