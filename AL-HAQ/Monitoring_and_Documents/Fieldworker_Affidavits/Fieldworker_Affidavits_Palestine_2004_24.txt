Affidavit No. 1959/2004
2004
I am a  resident of Toubas town, located to the south of Jenin city. The number  of inhabitantsin Toubas is 18,000 persons, and Toubas is big and similar  to a city. The people of Toubaswere living a calm and comfortable life  until the outbreak of the Intifada in 2000. Then, thingswent upside  down, as the Israeli army started to attack the Palestinian cities and  villages in ahorrible manner, using machinery, artillery, tanks,  bulldozers, and planes in shelling thehouses and etc. Here the lives of  Toubas citizens changed gradually for the worse like all theother  Palestinian cities and villages.At the  end of 2001, the Israeli army started to attack Toubas town with  machinery, imposecurfews, and shell its houses by planes. This was  reflected in the economic, educational,and social life of the citizens.  The closures and the construction of the Separation Wall onthe Green  Line has prevented thousands of Toubas workers from reaching their  workplacesin the 1948 areas inside Green Line. This has resulted in a  high unemployment rate. TheIsraeli army demolished all the PNA  headquarters in Toubas and damaged the infrastructureof the Palestinian  Security Forces in the town as well. This led to insecurity and  lawlessness,in addition to the prevalence of robbery of shops, houses  and cars, and an increase in whatis called stolen cars that threaten the  lives of our children in addition to absence of disciplineand  accountability.
