Affidavit No. 5435/2010
2010
My name is Tahrir al-‘Abed Muhammad al-Hajj and I am 43 years old. I live in the ‘Ein Jalout residential towers in al-Nuseiratt refugee camp in Central Gaza. I am a member on the Fatah Revolutionary Council and I am also a member of the Fatah Mobilisation and Organisation Commission in Gaza.On 24 April 2010, the Third Session of the Fatah Revolutionary Council was scheduled to convene in the city of Ramallah. I planned to travel to Ramallah and attend the Session along with seven other members on the Fatah Revolutionary Council. These were Mrs. Amal Hamad, Mr. Salah Abu-Khatla, Mr. Hisham ‘Abd-al-Raziq, Mr. ‘Abd-al-Hamid al Masri, Mr. Isma’il Abu Shammaleh, Mr. Usama al-Farra, and Mr. ‘Abdallah Abu-Samhadana. Through Mr. Khaled al-Batsh, a leading activist in the Islamic Jihad Movement and a mediator between Fatah and Hamas movements, Mr. Salah Abu-Khatla, Director of National Relations of Fatah Revolutionary Council, submitted a verbal request to Hamas leaders to allow us to travel to Ramallah.We had been waiting for a response to the request by Hamas government in Gaza and on 21 April 2010, three days prior to the Session’s allotted date, Mr. Khaled al-Batsh reported that we would be prevented from travelling to Ramallah. Mr. al-Batsh told Mr. Amal Hamad that based on a decision from the Gaza government Ministry of Interior, we will be prohibited to travel outside of Gaza. Reasons were not stated. I should note that I was also prevented from travelling to Ramallah on two earlier occasions based on similar decisions from the Ministry of Interior.
