Affidavit No. 1808/2004
2004
At around  10:50 noontime on 20 May 2004, while I was in the Women’s Programme  Center in the middle of al-Fawwar Refugee Camp, intending to leave the  main gate, during that time I saw a bunch of children, seven children,  and they were around 8 meters away. During that time, I saw one of the  children trying to look from behind the wall of al-Fawwar Girls  Elementary School and in that instant, when I looked at him, he was shot  in the head and I saw the child fall backwards and pieces of his brain  were being scattered and I was watching. I looked upwards or towards the  higher side and I saw three soldiers approaching from around 50 meters  away to the site where the child had fallen. At that moment, some young  men carried the body of the child and they went further, knowing that  pieces of his brain were still lying on the ground. I started screaming,  I went back inside, and I knew that this boy had become a martyr. He  was Islam Hussniyeh, around 15 years old. I did not witness any  stone-throwing at these moments, and the boy was not carrying anything  in his hand and he was trying to look towards the soldiers, as I had  witnessed. Secondly, I am not sure that I was very specific about the  timing, what hour exactly, but I know that this incident took place  between 10:00 am and 11:00 am before noontime.Date: 26 May 2004
