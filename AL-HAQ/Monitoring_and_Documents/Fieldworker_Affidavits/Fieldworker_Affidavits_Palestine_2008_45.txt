Affidavit No. 4357/2008
2008
I am an employee at the Preventive Security Agency. I am also one of the individuals deported from the Church of the Nativity. I originally lived in the city of Jenin, in the northern West Bank. At about 9:30 pm on 16 August 2008, I was in a mobile telephone shop in the area of the Unknown Soldier opposite my house. I live in flat on the 12th floor on the Unknown Soldier Tower in al-Rimal neighbourhood in the centre of Gaza city. A grey Mitsubishi jeep stopped in front of the shop. Two masked individuals, wearing black uniforms, got out of the jeep and forced me to climb onboard. A third masked individual was there. They drove to another area. Then they put me onboard another jeep and blindfolded me. They drove through the streets of Gaza for about 20 minutes and then stopped.Two individuals beat me all over my body for about half an hour. An individual then put a rope around my neck and tied it to something, which I assume was a tree, in order to hang me. I was bleeding heavily and screamed loudly. I shouted for help. Due to being severely beaten, I could also feel bone fractures in my feet and hands. They threatened to shoot me in the head and kill me. I screamed again. A person came by and asked why they were beating me. "Go away. We are on an official mission," they replied.A conversation went on between that person and the masked individuals, after which they left the area. The person told me that I was in an area opposite the car market, in the area of al-Zaytoun east of Gaza. I saw blood gush out heavily from my body. I sustained multiple bone fractures and contusions. The person called an ambulance, which arrived in half an hour and transported me to al-Shifa' Hospital. There, I was treated for my injuries and bone fractures. Both my legs and my right arm were treated using gypsum and platinum. I was then transported to al-Quds Hospital, west of Gaza, where I received medical treatment for four days and then returned home.
