Affidavit No. 5067/2009
2009
I live in a four-storey house along „Ein Sarah Main Street in the city of Hebron. The first floor comprises of commercial shops. My family and I live on the second floor. I have three children: Shurouq (seven-years-old, Suhayb (five-years-old), and Jana (one-year-old). Rawhi Abu-Hammad 27-years-old, a tenant, lives on the third floor. He is married and has one child, who is two-years-old. The fourth floor is empty. My brother „Azzam and his family used to live on that flour. Two months ago, however, they moved into a new house in another part of the city. The entrance to our building is a small road that is approximately 20 metres away from „Ein Sarah Main Street.At around 1:30 am on Tuesday, 1 September 2009, my wife woke me up and said that Israeli soldiers were banging on the door of our house. At the same time, I heard the sound of loud banging one of the doors. In addition to shouts and footsteps on the staircase, I heard the door of the flat on the upper floor opening.“You are destroying my house and want me to tell me where my brothers live!” I exclaimed. The officer, who spoke Arabic, refused to state his name. I told him I would not speak unless he allowed the women and children to enter the house. I heard the officer talk to a more senior officer, whose name was Samir. The latter requested that I be brought to the main street, to which two soldiers led me.The incident took place during the holy month of Ramadan. Before we went to bed, we tidied the house and had our last meal before daybreak (suhour). At around 7:00 am, I was about to leave my house. I wanted to make sure that a sum of 4150 NIS was in my pocket, but I only found 200 NIS. I asked my wife about the lost money (3950 NIS), but she said she knew nothing about it. I realised that the soldiers had taken it from the jacket. I had been saving that money to prepare a banquet for Ramadan.
