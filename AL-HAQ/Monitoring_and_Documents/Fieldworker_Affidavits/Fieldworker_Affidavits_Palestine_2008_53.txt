Affidavit No. 4367/2008
2008
On Thursday, 8 August 2008, a demonstration took place in my village of Ni'lin, west of the city of Ramallah, in protest against the land confiscation and isolation of the village as a result of the construction of the Wall. As usual, it was planned that the residents gather in the village centre and march towards the construction site of the Wall, south of the village. I joined the village residents. At about 11:00 am, the peaceful demonstration set off from the Municipality square. As we reached the construction site, a number of private security guards were watching over machinery and construction workers.Suddenly, a number of Israeli occupying soldiers arrived on foot, including members of the Israeli Border Police. Also, Special Forces troops were on board a tractor. When the soldiers saw me approaching a bulldozer, Israeli Special Forces troops stepped down from the tractor. A soldier beat me on the face with the butt of his M16 rifle, leaving me with an injured jaw. He also punched me. I suffered unbearable pain and felt that my jaw was dislocated. I could not move my jaw. I saw blood gush out of my mouth. Immediately, young people carried me to the first aid centre in the village. From there, an ambulance belonging to the Palestinian Red Crescent Society transported me to the emergency department at al-Sheikh Zayed Hosptial in the city of Ramallah.Having had my jaw x-rayed, it was evident that I had sustained two bone fractures. Physicians treated me; putting wires inside my mouth. Two teeth were also pulled out. Now I suffer severe pain and can barely talk. I cannot eat naturally as I use a straw to take my food, which has to be liquid.
