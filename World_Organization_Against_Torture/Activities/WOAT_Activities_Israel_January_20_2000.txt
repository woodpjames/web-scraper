Brief description of the situation   The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the  Palestinian Society for the Protection of Human Rights and the  Environment (LAW), a member of the OMCT network, of the  death in custody and suspected torture of  Palestinian detainee  Lafi al- Rajabi, 20.   According to the information received, Lafi al-Rajabi died on  Friday 14th January 2000, it is assumed, as a result of torture by  Israeli police.   According to LAW's documentation, in an affidavit submitted to  LAW by the victim's family, the victim was arrested  approximately 7 months ago whilst he was attending a court  hearing of one of his relatives in al-Ramleh. Al-Rajabi was  arrested after being accused of having ties with criminal  defendants and because he was not carrying his ID card at the  time. Whilst he was being detained at one of the Israeli detention  centers near the Ariel settlement, near Nablus, his family had  visited him. During his detention Al- Rajabi was reportedly  receiving threats from disguised persons as well as the police.   The victim's mother explained that her son had called her on  Friday 14 January 2000 at 5:30pm. The family was told to  intervene and request al-Rajabi's release immediately as it was  considered his life was in danger. A few hours later, his family  was informed, through the District Coordinating Office in Hebron,  that their son had died. The police immediately claimed the  deceased had strangled himself. The corpse was transferred by  the Israeli police to the Abu Kbir institute for autopsy and then  was delivered on 17 January 2000 to his family without an autopsy  report or an investigation into the incident.    According to the victim's family, signs that he had been subjected  to torture were apparent on his body. Marks that appeared to be  from cable wire appeared around his neck and he had wounds  and cuts on his back. His lips were also blue colored and bruises  from apparent blows appeared under his armpit.    The International Secretariat of OMCT wishes to express its  grave concern over this death in detention in Israel and urges the  Israeli authorities to respect the rulings of the Israeli High Court  and uphold the International Convention on Civil and Political  Rights and Convention Against Torture, both ratified by Israel.     Actions requested   Please write to the Israeli authorities urging them to:   i.	order an immediate full and impartial investigation into  the circumstances of the death of Lafi al-Rajabi in  order to identify those responsible, bring them to trial  and apply the penal, civil and/or administrative  sanctions provided by law;    ii.	guarantee adequate compensation and rehabilitation  to the family of Rafi al-Rajabi;    iii.	guarantee all human rights and fundamental freedoms  in accordance with international human rights  standards.
