Brief description:  The Observatory was informed by the Sudanese Organisation Against Torture (SOAT) that Mr. Nour Eldin Mohamed Abdel Rahim, Omda (tribal leader) of Shoba, and Mr. Bahr Eldin Abdallah Rifa, Omda of Jabal Si, both leaders from the Fur tribe, were arrested by security officers in Kabkabia on May 9, 2004.  According to the information received, Mr. Nour Eldin Mohamed Abdel Rahim and Mr. Bahr Eldin Abdallah Rifa, were arrested after they participated in a meeting with the local authorities and Red Cross representatives on May 9, 2004, concerning human rights violations in Kabkabia region, Darfur, where the local population, including the Fur tribe, is subjected to recurrent and deadly attacks by pro-governmental militia. They are being detained at Kabkabia security offices and are denied any visits by family or contact with lawyers. Mr. Nour Eldin Mohamed Abdel Rahim was previously arrested on May 21, 2002 by security forces, with 7 other persons, after they had reported an attack on Shoba to the authorities.  The Observatory is deeply concerned by the measures taken by the Sudanese authorities in order to silence accounts of grave human rights violations occurring in Darfur. In this regard, the Observatory recalls that that Mr. Salih Mahmoud Osman, a member of the Sudan Organization Against Torture’s (SOAT) lawyers network remains in detention in Kober prison since his arrest on February 1, 2004, by the members of the National Security Agency (NSA). Although the grounds for this arbitrary detention remain unknown, there is reason to believe that his arrest and detention are connected to his legal activities in the Darfur region (see Urgent Appeal SDN 002/0104/OBS 009.1, March 5th, 2004).  The Observatory also recalls that Mr. Madawi Ibrahim Adam, 47, Chairperson of the Sudan Social Development Organisation (SUDO), a voluntary organisation created to promote sustainable development and human rights, that has been particularly active in Darfur, remains in arbitrary detention since December 28, 2003 (See Urgent Appeal SDN 001/0104/OBS 001, January 6, 2004). Such is also the case of Mr. Osman Adam Abdel Mawla, 39, a human rights activist and a member of SUDO, who was arrested on May 5 (see Urgent Appeal SUD 003/0504/OBS 035, May 10, 2004).  The Observatory is deeply concerned by Messrs. Nour Eldin Mohamed Abdel Rahim and Bahr Eldin Abdallah Rifa’s arrest and detention and fears for their physical and psychological integrity.  The Observatory urges the Sudanese authorities to immediately and unconditionally release them and to conform with the Declaration on Humans Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, in particular articles 5.c which provides that “everybody has the right […] to communicate with non-governmental and intergovernmental organisations” and 8.2 which provides that everyone has “the right, individually and in association with others, to submit to governmental bodies and agencies and organizations concerned with public affairs criticism and proposals for improving their functioning and to draw attention to any aspect of their work that may hinder or impede the promotion, protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms”.  Actions requested:  Please write to the Sudanese authorities and ask them to:  i.	Ensure in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Messrs. Nour Eldin Mohamed Abdel Rahim and Bahr Eldin Abdallah Rifa; ii.	Order the immediate release Messrs. Nour Eldin Mohamed Abdel Rahim, Bahr Eldin Abdallah Rifa and Salih Mahmoud Osman in the absence of valid legal charges against them, or if legitimate charges exist, bring them before an impartial tribunal in the shortest delay and guarantee their right to a fair and impartial trial;  iii.	Conform to the provisions of the Declaration on Humans Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, in particular article 1, which states that "everyone has the right, individually or in association with others, to promote the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels", article 12§2 which provides that “[t]he State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration” as well as article 5.c and 8.2 mentioned above; iv.	ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards.
