Child concern/Torture/Threats   Follow up to case LKA 180903.CC, LKA 180903.1 CC  The International Secretariat of OMCT requests your URGENT  intervention in the following situation in Sri Lanka.  New information  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Asian  Human Rights  Commission HK, a member of the OMCT network, that the  father and mother of torture victim Dawundage Pushpakumara (14 years  old) have left their home due to threats from the police and a local  politician after they made a complaint to human rights organizations.  In end September, they had already received threats that their house  would be burnt down (LKA 180903.1 CC.).  Dawundage Pushpakumara, 14, was severely tortured by the Officer In  Charge (OIC) of the Saliyawewa police post, (Puttalm) and other  police officers from 1 September to 2 September 2003. When he was  released from the police station, the police impeded the victim's  obtaining medical treatment because they were afraid that the medical  record of the victim's injuries would be used against them in court.  With the help of the Child Rights Authority of Sri Lanka and human  rights organizations he was taken to Colombo for medical treatment.  Thereafter he has been living in hiding for fear of returning back  home due to threats from the police.   Meanwhile a fundamental rights violation case was filed on his behalf  in the supreme courts of Sri Lanka. Now the father and the mother of  Pushpakumara allegedly have been constantly pressured by the police  and others to withdraw the case filed against the police. In an  affidavit filed by the father of Pushpakumar, D.K. Kularatne, has set  out the details of harassment by the police and stated that his wife  has left the house in fear on 31 October 2003. Thereafter the  Saliyawewa police post asked him to report to the police station on 3  November 2003. For fear of being harassed and tortured he has also  fled his house and sought protection.   Complaints regarding such threats have been made earlier to the  National Police Commission and the National Human Rights Commission  and the Attorney General of Sri Lanka. However no effective action  has been taken to guarantee the security for this family which is  very poor and powerless. The officer in charge of the police station  who is alleged to be the main perpetrator in the torture of  Pushpakumara still continues to hold his post.  OMCT is gravely concerned about the continuing threats and efforts to  intimidate Pushpakumara's family and for their safety and strongly  condemns the continuing impunity of the police officers. The OMCT  calls upon the Sri Lankan authorities to take immediate action to  ensure the physical and psychological integrity of the victim and his  family, to order a thorough and impartial investigation against those  involved, and award appropriate reparation to the victim and his  family.  Brief reminder of the situation  On 1st September 2003,  Dawundage Pushpakumara had been taken by  force from his home to the Saliyawewa Police Post in Putlam. There,  he had been assaulted and told to confess to having stolen a chain.  He was thrown into a cell, with his hands tied behind him and hung on  a beam. There the Officer in Charge (OIC) and several others  assaulted him. Then he was put  in a room full of ants with his hands  still tied.  His parents were prevented from seeing him and he  continued to be threatened and assaulted until the next morning (2nd  September), when the OIC finally allowed him to go home with the  mother. After Pushpakumara went back home, he complained of headaches  and fainted. The next morning the Genera L Hospital of Putlam  admitted him.  Action requested  Please write to the authorities in Sri Lanka urging them to:  i.	take all measures necessary to guarantee the physical and  psychological integrity of Dawundage Pushpakumara and his parents; ii.	put an end immediately to the harassment and threats perpetrated against them; iii.	apply the penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions provided by law against the policemen involved;  Addresses  1.
