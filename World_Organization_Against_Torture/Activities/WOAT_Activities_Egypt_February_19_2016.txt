The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint 
programme of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and 
the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), requests your 
urgent intervention in the following situation in Egypt.

Description of the situation:

The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the 
threat of imminent closure addressed by Egyptian authorities to the El 
Nadeem Center for the Rehabilitation for Victims of Violence and Torture
(“Nadeem Center”)[1], based in Cairo.

According to the information received, on February 17, 2016 at about 
4 p.m. two police officers from the Azbakeyya District authority and one
city employee ordered the employees of the Nadeem Center to leave the 
center's premises. The three men delivered an “administrative closure
order” signed by the Director of the Health Ministry’s Free Treatment 
Directorate and addressed to the head of the Azbakeyya district 
authority, referring to a violation of Law 453/1954[2]. The document 
ordered the closure of the Center based on a decision
signed on February 8, 2016, “for breaching 
license conditions” (providing no further information) stamped by the 
Cairo district on February 15.

The implementation of the order has been postponed until February 
22 when the Center representatives will meet with the Ministry of Health
to discuss the reasons for the closure order.

At the beginning of the month of February, the Center was visited by an 
employee of the Ministry of Health, who came to inspect the Center based
on an order given by phone from the Minister of Health himself. The 
Minister employee did not have any official
papers nor an inspection warrant. The employee of the Ministry ordered a
copy of the Center's license. No breaches of regulations were noted in 
that occasion.

The decision to close the Nadeem Center comes at a time of rising 
government pressure on independent human rights groups in Egypt, in the 
context of a dramatic deterioration of the human rights situation, 
marked namely by a notable increase in cases of torture,
deaths in detention, forced disappearances and a crackdown on civil 
society, including peaceful protesters and human rights defenders.

The Observatory urges the Egyptian authorities to immediately cease 
all acts of harassment against the Nadeem Center and against all human 
rights organisations in the country, and to comply with its 
constitutional obligations (in particular Article 78 and Article
93 of the 2014 Egyptian Constitution which respectively recognise the 
right to freedom of association and Egypt's compliance with 
international human rights conventions ratified by Egypt) as well as 
its international legal obligations (in particular Article
22 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights – 
ICCPR).

Actions requested:

Please write to the authorities of Egypt asking them to:

i.Put an end to all forms of harassment against the Nadeem Center all human rights organisations and defenders in Egypt;

ii.Cancel the order to close the Nadeem Center;
 
iii.Comply with all the provisions of the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, in particular with:
 
- its Article 1, which provides that “everyone has the 
right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to 
strive for the protection and realization of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”;
- its Article 5(b): “For the purpose of promoting and protecting human 
rights and fundamental freedoms, everyone has the right, individually 
and in association with others, at the national and international levels
(b) To form, join and participate in non-governmental
organizations, associations or groups;”
- its Article 12.2, which provides that “the State shall take 
all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent 
authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, 
against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse
discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence
of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the 
present Declaration”;

iv. Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and 
fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights 
standards and international instruments ratified by Egypt.

[1] The Nadeem Center is registered in Egypt since 1993 and has provided
hundreds of torture victims with vital services including counselling 
and legal assistance. The Center issues monthly summaries of reported 
instances of torture, death, and medical negligence
in police custody. Many of the Center’s patients say they have 
been tortured by Egyptian security forces.

[2] The law 453/1954 regulates industrial and commercial shops, however,
not clinics. The law states that “no business shop subject to this law 
can be set up or run without the relevant license; no changes or 
amendment in such shops may be executed without
the approval of entity which issued such license.”
