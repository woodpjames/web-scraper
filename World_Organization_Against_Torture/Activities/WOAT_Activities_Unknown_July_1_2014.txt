The undersigned organisations working with and for
human rights defenders (HRDs) welcome the adoption by the Council of the
European Union (EU) of the 23 June 2014 Conclusions on the 10th Anniversary
of the EU Guidelines on Human Rights Defenders. We express satisfaction with
the renewed commitment of the EU and its Member States to the implementation of
the Guidelines. In particular, we welcome the call for improved support to
vulnerable and marginalized human rights defenders, women HRDs and those
operating in remote regions. We also greet commitments to the creation of a
safe and enabling environment, the continued effort to implement an effective
and coherent policy on HRDs and the need to raise awareness and train Member
States and EU staff on the HRD Guidelines in cooperation with civil society. We
wholly support the importance given to interacting with and assisting different
international and regional mechanisms for the protection of HRDs while giving
increased attention to the phenomenon of reprisals.
 
The undersigned organisations stress the importance of
reinforced efforts towards the full implementation of the Guidelines. In order
to facilitate the fulfilment of the EU renewed commitment, we make the
following recommendations for concrete actions to be taken by the EU and its
Member States at field and capital levels, and we encourage the Council of the
EU to include these recommendations in the soon-to-be revised EU Action Plan on
Human Rights and Democracy:
 
Coherent EU policy on HRDs:
 
-       Implement the EU Guidelines on HRDs fully and genuinely
in all third countries, regardless of political, economic or other
considerations;
 
-       Actively support HRDs through a flexible combination
of concrete actions and public diplomacy, on the basis of effective
consultation with concerned HRDs;
 
-       Clearly communicate human rights priorities of EU
country strategies to local HRDs to facilitate their action;
 
-       Provide systematic feedback to HRDs, civil society and
the public on EU and Member States’ actions on HRDs, encouraging meaningful
public debate on how to reinforce their vital efforts;
 
-       Improve inter-institutional cooperation on HRDs by
setting up a ‘filter group’ made of focal points, from the European Parliament,
the European External Action Service and the European Commission, to meet
regularly, review and follow-up individual cases, and prepare future actions in
close cooperation with HRDs liaison officers in the field.
 
 
Support to all HRDs, including vulnerable and
marginalized HRDs, women HRDs and those operating in remote areas:
 
-       Use all means available to the EU and its Member
States, including both diplomacy and concrete actions such as trial
observation, as well as funding, visibility and political backing, to give
meaningful support to HRDs.
 
-       Regularly and consistently use political and human
rights dialogues as well as other channels of communication to remind third
countries of their duty to protect HRDs, and ensure involvement of HRDs in
these processes.
 
-       Adopt a proactive approach towards vulnerable groups
of HRDs, women HRDs and defenders operating in remote areas, by coordinating
among EU missions the joint and individual responsibility to cover different
geographical areas in the third country and to engage with diverse HRDs working
not only on civil, political, but also on economic, social and cultural rights.
EU Delegations and Member State missions must carry out regular visits outside
large urban centres and strive to meet with grass-roots and community-based
HRDs, exchange information on the human rights situation, meet the protection
needs of HRDs and provide visibility for their essential work to promote and
protect human rights. 
 
 
Safe and enabling environment:
 
-       Promote and implement EU and Member State public
information campaigns in third countries to increase the visibility and
legitimacy of the work of HRDs, focusing in particular on the most vulnerable
groups;
 
-       Accompany and support efforts of civil society
organisations in their demands towards government authorities to abrogate
restrictive laws and norms, to adopt and/or strengthen national public policies
and mechanisms for the protection of HRDs, and to fight against impunity.
 
Raising awareness about the Guidelines:
 
-       Set up indicators and benchmarks to encourage concrete
action on the Guidelines by all Member State diplomatic missions and EU Delegations;
 
-       Translate the Guidelines on HRDs into local languages
and disseminate them among civil society, including different ethnic minority
groups and indigenous communities;
 
-       Organise yearly regional workshops with the
participation of civil society to exchange experiences and lessons learned, and
build the capacity of HRDs, EU and Member States diplomatic staff, in
particular the human rights focal points and liaison officers for HRDs.
 
We look forward to continuing our exchange with the EU
and its Member States and remain engaged to support the work of HRDs in their
crucial role of promoting and protecting human rights worldwide.
