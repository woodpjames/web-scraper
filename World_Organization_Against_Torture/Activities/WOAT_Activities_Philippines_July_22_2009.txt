The Asian Regional Seminar is being organised with the Philippines Alliance of Human Rights Advocates (PAHRA), and it is the third of three regional seminars on this issue scheduled as part of a project supported by the European Union.  OMCT research has demonstrated the strong links between failure to respect economic, social and cultural rights and violence, including torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, summary or arbitrary executions, forced disappearances, violence against women and violence against children. And it has also shown that acting on those root causes can reduce violence. Objectives The principal objective of the Asian Regional Seminar is to help NGOs prepare action files for submission to the UN or other organisations, and/or elements for inclusion in alternative reports for submission to UN Treaty Bodies containing recommendations for practical action to stop or prevent torture and other forms of violence by dealing with their economic social and cultural root causes. An important objective for OMCT is to build partnerships with NGOs to work together on these issues over the long term. The seminar, in particular, will seek to:help NGOs understand the various      ways violations of economic, social and cultural rights are linked to      violence and how acting on those root causes can reduce violence;help NGOs to develop their own       capacity to address the economic, social and cultural root causes of       violenceidentify how action on the root        causes of violence could relate to the specific circumstances of the        participants’ countries;assist participants in         preparing action files for submission to the UN and other         organisations; assist participants in          preparing elements for including in alternative reports to UN Treaty          bodies and in submissions to other institutions (for example the          European Union) containing information on the link between the denial          of economic, social and cultural rights and torture along with          recommendations for specific action; and identify new and emerging           issues for attention. Methods       of work The seminar’s       work will be built principally around a discussion and refinement of       draft action files or elements for alternative reports prepared in       advance by each participant in order to ensure that the participants       leave the seminar with practical action to take on returning home.       Particular emphasis will be placed on the potential for human rights and       development NGOs to bring about change through collaborative projects. In       addition, participants will be encouraged to exchange experiences and       challenges and describe the methods that they have used to address the       seminar’s issues. Selection       of participants Eighteen       representatives from Asian NGOs will be selected to participate.       Nominations are invited from members of OMCT’s SOS-Torture Network and       other NGOs working closely with OMCT. Nominations are also invited from       NGOs active in the fields of economic, social and cultural rights and       development that wish to address the economic, social and cultural root       causes of violence from their own perspective. Organisations combating       torture and those working for economic, social and cultural rights and       development may wish to submit joint nominations (2 participants) with a       view to working together in the future on these issues. Organisations       wishing to nominate a participant are requested to provide a short       explanation of the relevance of participation in the seminar to their       work and to explain what the organisation could bring to the seminar’s       discussions. The participants selected to take part in the regional       seminar must prepare and submit in advance of the seminar a 5 to 10 page       paper addressing the economic, social and cultural root causes of torture       and other forms of violence in their country. This paper should include       the elements for an action file or for elements for inclusion in an       alternative report; joint approaches by human rights and development NGOs       are encouraged.
