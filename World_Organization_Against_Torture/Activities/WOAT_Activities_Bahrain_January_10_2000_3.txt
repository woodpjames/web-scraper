Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by reliable sources of the detention and torture of a number of persons during the month of December 1999.  According to the information received, two women, Fatima Salman Maki Salman (aged 24) and Asia Abdul Aziz Ismael (aged 20), from Kharjya-Sitra, were detained and allegedly tortured on 20 December.  They suffered insults and ill-treatment before their release.  Also, the mother of Mohammed Khalil Ebrahim Mohammed (aged 17) – see case BHR 100100.CC – was arrested along with her son on 15 December, and the contents of her house vandalized by security forces, when she attempted to inquire about the reasons for which her son was being arrested.  On that same day it is reported that Ahmed Abdul Hadi Al Qasab, (aged 23), Seyed Hashim Seyed Hamid (aged 22), Malik Ahmed Darweesh, (aged 24), and Seyed Raed Seyed Hamid, from Iska Jidhafs, were also arrested.  On 28th December 1999, Mohammed Nasir Al Tooq, Management member of Sitra’s Assembly Hall “Matam”, and Yousif Al Roomi, (24 years old), arrested for reciting in a shi’a religious procession.  Both are being held in Al-Hoora Police Station, which is headed by the torturer Abdul Salam Al Ansari.  Reports have also been received concerning a young person, Mohammed Salman, is being kept in a solitary detention since his arrest last month.  He is said to be suffering from health problems allegedly as a result of torture that he is subjected to on a daily basis in the Dry-Dock Prison’s torture chambers.  These cases are part of the ongoing political unrest and the widespread popular movement calling for political reforms and the restoration of democracy.   On 26 August 1975, Amiri Act No. 14 was issued dissolving the National Assembly. Subsequently, Amiri Act No. 4 /1975 was issued suspending Article 65 of the Constitution and other articles relevant to the organization of parliamentary life. These two Acts, which are still in force, constitute a violation of Articles 65, 32/a, and 42 of the Constitution. The constitution establishes that in such an event elections for a new assembly must be held within two months. The ruling family has steadfastly refused to do it, and this refusal is one major factor underlying the current unrest.  These persons were arrested under the 1974 State Security Law which allows for the detention of a person without charge or trial for up to three years and sets a special court system "the State Security Court", a procedure of which falls short of International standards for fair trial.    OMCT is gravely concerned for the physical and psychological integrity of these detainees.  Actions requested  Please write to the Bahrain authorities urging that they :   i.	take all necessary measures to guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of the aforementioned persons held in detention, and order their immediate release in the absence of valid legal charges or, if such charges exist, bring them before an impartial and competent tribunal and guarantee their procedural rights in all times;  ii.	carry out a full and impartial investigation into the alleged arbitrary detentions, ill-treatment and torture, in order to identify those responsible, bring them to trial and apply the penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions provided by law;  iii.	put an immediate end to the use of arbitrary detention of  people by the police and abrogate 1974 State Security Law and all national laws which are not in compliance with international human rights standards.   iv.	guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
