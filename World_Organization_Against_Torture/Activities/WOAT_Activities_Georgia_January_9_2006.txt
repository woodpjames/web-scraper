Brief description of the situation:The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Human Rights Information and Documentation Center (HRIDC), a member of the OMCT network, about the condemnation by the Civil Court of Tbilisi of Mr. Mahomed Mahaev, Chechen refugee and member of the humanitarian organisation Imedi (“Hope”), to three months of preliminary imprisonment, on December 28, 2005.  According to the information received, on December 27, 2005, Mr. Mahomed Mahaev was arrested by members of the Special Operative Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs as his organisation was believed to have links with the terrorist network Al Qaeda. Imedi was also accused of “falsification of documents”, and of “abuse of duties”. All humanitarian activities carried out by Imedi in the Pankisi gorge have since then been stopped  The General Procurer’s Office is said to have been investigating the case since July 2005. On September 6, 2005, members of the General Prosecutor’s Office had raided the flat of Mr. Makhaev, taking away computers and all documents linked to his work at Imedi. The organisation had then to stop its activities for one month and a half. On September 20, 2005, a criminal investigation procedure started, based on information provided by the financial monitoring department.  At the end of October 2005, the Special Department on the legalisation of illegal income of the General Prosecutor’s Office returned all the documents to Mr. Makhaev.  Mr. Makhaev established and registered Imedi in April 2003 as an organisation assisting Chechen refugees in Georgia and providing them with humanitarian aid. The organisation has been in particular operating in Pankisi gorge, on Georgia’s border with Chechnya.  OMCT fears for the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Mahomed Makhaev. Action requested:Please write to the Georgian authorities and ask them to: i.	Guarantee, in all circumstances, the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Mahomed Mahaev;  ii.
