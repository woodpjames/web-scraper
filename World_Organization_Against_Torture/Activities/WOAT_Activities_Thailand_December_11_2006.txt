Brief description of the situation: The Observatory has been informed by the Union for Civil Liberty (UCL) about the enforced disappearance of Mr. Thares Sodsri, a prominent environmental activist in Ban Kha District, Rachaburi province. According to the information received, on December 1, 2006, Mr. Thares’ house maid went to the police station to report his disappearance. Indeed, she reportedly left him on the evening of November 30, 2006 and the following day, he was missing although some lights were still on inside the house. Police officers, while searching evidences at Mr. Thares’ home, found several traces of blood, three used handgun cartridges, two bullets and tire prints on the front lawn of Mr. Thares’ house. On December 2, 2006, the police raided several locations in Ban Kha district and confiscated pistols, a blood-strained truck and clothes, to be examined by forensic services. When interrogated, Mr. Thares’ wife stated that a few days before these events, their three dogs had been poisoned. Besides, two weeks before these events, Mr. Thares had submitted a video to the Minister of Natural Resources and Environment, showing illegal forest destruction by a local political leader, in Ratchaburi, which is under a royally-initiated project for forest protection. He was also to testify in court against several suspected persons in a forest encroachment case. Mr. Thares has also conducted a campaign against illegal forest encroachment projects in Ban Kha sub-district over the last ten years, and has led villagers to protect their forest from local influential persons, seeking to illegally exploit it. The Observatory expresses its deepest concern regarding this enforced disappearance, which occurs in the context of persistent violations of fundamental freedoms in Thailand. Actions required: Please write to the Thai authorities and ask them to:  Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Thares and of all human rights defenders in Thailand, including environmental activists; Take prompt action in order to locate Mr. Thares, make public his whereabouts, and ensure his immediate release; Conduct an immediate, independent and impartial investigation into Mr. Thares Sodsri’s enforced disappearance in order to identify those responsible, bring them to justice and sentence them according to law; Put an end to any kind of reprisals against human rights defenders in Thailand; Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its article 1 according to which “everyone has the right, individually or in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, article 6(b), which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others (...) to publish, impart or disseminate to others views, information and knowledge on all human rights and fundamental freedoms”, and its article 8(2), which provides that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to submit to governmental bodies and agencies and organisations concerned with public affairs criticism and proposals for improving their functioning and to draw attention to any aspect of their work that may hinder or impede the promotion, protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms”; Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by Thailand.
