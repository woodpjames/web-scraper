The Network had planned a Round-table on “Principles of Open Dialogue about the Social and Legal Situation of LGBT People in Russia” to be held on February 27 as well as a meeting of the Interregional Board of the Russian LGBT Network to be held on March 1 and 2, 2014.Because of the cancellation made by the Hotel Hilton Moscow Leningradskaya, the two events planned by the Russian LGBT Network in Moscow were seriously disrupted.On March 4, 2014, the Russian LGBT Network sent an official letter to Mr. Christopher J. Nassetta, President and Chief Executive Officer of Hilton Worldwide, and to Mr. Simon Vincent, a member of the Hilton Executive Committee, to denounce the discrimination performed by the Hilton Moscow Leningradskaya and ask for public apology, monetary compensation.On March 10, 2014, Mr. Nassetta, CEO of Hilton Worldwide, responded to Mr. Larry Poltavstev, President of the international NGO Human Rights Spectrum, which had also denounced on February 26, 2014 the cancellation made by Hilton Leningradskaya Moscow, that Hilton Worldwide believed that their franchise hotel partner in Moscow had acted according to its own interpretation of local laws, as it is entitled to.On March 13, 2014, Mr. Nassetta replied to the Russian LGBT Network, apologizing for “any distress this situation caused” and renewing his support to the LGBT community. However, he stressed that Hilton Worldwide believes that its partner in Russia was acting “in accordance with the local laws”, and that they expect each of their franchisees “to comply with laws in every jurisdiction where they operate”. As a gesture of good will, Mr. Nassetta agreed to cover the financial loss incurred by the Russian LGBT Network.The Observatory expresses its concern for the discriminatory impact on the right to freedom of assembly and of association of the anti-LGBTI Law of July 2013, which prohibits “propaganda on non-traditional sexual relations”, jeopardizing further the work of LGBT activists. The Observatory considers that reliance on discriminatory local laws cannot be used by the Hilton Worldwide Direction as a proper justification for allowing its franchisees to perform unilateral acts impeding LBGT rights defenders' activities and recalls that this law contravenes international standards binding the Russian Federation. More generally, the Observatory denounces acts of discrimination repeatedly faced by LGBT defenders in the Russian Federation and calls on the authorities to take necessary measures to ensure that LGBT rights defenders can carry on their peaceful activities without discrimination or harassment.Actions requested: Please write to the authorities of Russian Federation, urging them to: i. Put an end to any act of discrimination and harassment against LGBT rights defenders in the Russian Federation, and ensure in all circumstances that they are able to carry out their legitimate activities without any hindrance; ii.
