The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of
the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation
Against Torture (OMCT) requests your urgent intervention in the following
situation in Turkey. 
Description
of the situation:
The
Observatory has been informed by the Human Rights Association (İHD) and the
Human Rights Foundation of Turkey (HRFT) about the arbitrary arrest and
subsequent release of 49 individuals for their participation in a press
conference organised by the İzmir Peace Block to protest against human rights
violations in Cizre (South-eastern Anatolia Region of Turkey) and call for
peace. 
According
to the information received, on February 9, 2016, 49 individuals including Ms. Gurbet Uçar,
President of İHD İzmir Branch,
Mr. Nizamettin Aktaş, İHD Central Executive Board member, Mr. Coşkun
Üsterci, HRFT Executive Committee member, and Mr. Bahri Akkan,
President of Egitimsen (Teachers’ Union) İzmir First Branch, were arrested in
İzmir by the police while attending a press conference organised by the İzmir
Peace Block. As the conference was about to begin, riot police forces
forcefully entered the location, using excessive force including rubber
bullets, against the participants. Mr. Mehmet
Aker, İHD Executive Committee member, was shot in the leg and
injured. 
The 49 activists were kept in police vehicles for over
three hours without any arrest warrant, before being taken to İzmir Security
Directorate. 38 of them were released on the same day. The other 11 activists
remained in police custody overnight and were released the following day. The
49 are facing charges for violating the law on assemblies, marches and
demonstrations (Law No. 2911) and doing propaganda for an illegal organisation.

The police intervention and arrests are based on a
directive issued by the İzmir Governorship banning all press conferences
organised by the İzmir Peace Block. Both IHD İzmir Branch and HRFT İzmir Office
hold observer member status in the İzmir Peace Block.
The Observatory recalls that this wave of arbitrary
arrests and detentions is part of wide-range anti-terrorism operations, started
in late July 2015. The operations turned into a massive crackdown on some civil
society organisations depicted as “terrorist networks”. This campaign has been
targeting dozens of peaceful activists who have been involved in the monitoring
of human rights violations resulting from anti-terrorism operations and who
have been advocating for a peaceful resolution of the Kurdish issue. These
peaceful activists include human rights defenders, particularly IHD members, lawyers, political party representatives and
journalists.
The
Observatory calls upon the Turkish authorities to immediately put an end to the
ongoing harassment against human rights defenders, and particularly İHD members, since it only seems to aim at sanctioning
their legitimate human rights activities.
