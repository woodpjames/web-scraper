Brief description of the situation :  On 19th January 2000, the Egyptian Organisation for Human Rights (EOHR – member of FIDH and OMCT) received circular No. 1484, signed by the Cairo Police Department, stating the decision to suspend 14 publications.  This decision is based on decree No. 592 laid down by the prefect of Cairo on 20th September 1999.  Amongst the 14 targeted is the EOHR publication entitled ‘Human Rights’.  This bulletin, destined to members of the EOHR was created in 1986; it’s goal is to inform readers of the activities of the organisation and, more generally, to sensitise readers to Human Rights.  The Observatory condemns such measures which constitute a grave attack on freedom of expression guaranteed by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ratified by Egypt, as well as the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders which stipulates in article 6 (b) «Everyone has the right, individually and in association with others: As provided for in human rights and other applicable international instruments, freely to publish, impart or disseminate to others views, information and knowledge on all human rights and fundamental freedoms.»   The Observatory considers this decision an indication of a further attempt by the Egyptian authorities to muzzle civil society.  In June 1999, a particularly restrictive law, with regards to NGO activities, was issued by President Moubarak.  Actions requested:  Please write to the Egyptian authorities urging them to:  i.	take all necessary measures needed to immediately re-establish the authorisation to publish the 14 publications mentioned, particularly ‘Human Rights’ by EOHR.  ii    ensure the implementation of the provisions of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 9 1998 (Declaration concerning the rights and responsibilities of individuals, groups and institutions to promote and protect universally recognised human rights and fundamental liberties) in particular its Article 1 which  provides that «Every person has the right, individually or collectively, to promote the protection and fulfilment of human rights and fundamental liberties at the national and international level.»     iii	more generally, guarantee the effective respect of fundamental human rights and freedoms in accordance with the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and international and regional Pacts and Covenants ratified by Egypt.
