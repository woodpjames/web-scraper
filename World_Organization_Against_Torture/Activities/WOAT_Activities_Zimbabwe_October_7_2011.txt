Judicial harassment
Zimbabwe
October 7, 2011
 
The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint 
programme of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World 
Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent intervention in the 
following situation in Zimbabwe.
 
Description of the situation:
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the 
remand of the judicial case against Ms. Jenni Williams, National Coordinator of the organisation Women of Zimbabwe Arise 
(WOZA), and Ms. Magodonga Mahlangu, WOZA member. 
 
According to the information received, on October 6, 2011, the Two 
Tredgold Magistrates Court remanded the judicial case pending against Ms. Jenni 
Williams and Ms. Magodonga Mahlangu to December 12, 2011.
 
Ms. Williams and Ms. Mahlangu are being prosecuted on fabricated 
charges of "theft" and "kidnapping", following their arrest on September 21, 
2011 together with ten other persons in the framework of a peaceful march in 
Bulawayo to commemorate the International Day of Peace, which was violently 
dispersed by the authorities. 
 
The two women human rights defenders had then been detained at 
Mlondozi female prison, Khami prison complex, Bulawayo, without access to 
necessary medication, until they were eventually granted bail on October 4, 
2011.
 
The ten other individuals, charged with "criminal nuisance", had been 
discharged on September 22, 2011 by the Bulawayo Magistrates Court, and 
subsequently released. 
 
Actions requested:
 
Please write to the authorities of Zimbabwe asking them 
to:
 
i.         
Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological 
integrity of Ms. Jenni Williams and Ms. Magodonga Mahlangu;
 
ii.       
Put an end to any kinds of harassment - including at the judicial 
level - against Ms. Williams and Ms. Mahlangu, which seem to only aim at 
sanctioning their human rights activities, as well as against all human rights 
defenders in Zimbabwe; 
 
iii.      
Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights 
Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 
1998 and notably :
- its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, 
individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the 
protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the 
national and international levels”;
- Article 5 (b), which states that “For the purpose of promoting and protecting human rights and fundamental 
freedoms, everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, 
at the national and international levels [...] to form, join and 
participate in non-governmental organizations, associations or 
groups”;
- its Article 6 (b) and (c), which states that “Everyone has the 
right, individually and in association with others […] as provided for in human 
rights and other applicable international instruments, freely to publish, impart 
or disseminate to others views, information and knowledge on all human rights 
and fundamental freedoms and [...] to study, discuss, form and hold opinions on 
the observance, both in law and in practice, of all human rights and fundamental 
freedoms and, through these and other appropriate means, to draw public 
attention to those matters”;
- and its Article 12.2, which provides that “the State shall take all 
necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of 
everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, 
threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or 
any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of 
the rights referred to in the present Declaration”.
 
iv.     More generally, ensure in all circumstances the respect for human 
rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with in accordance with the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with international and regional human 
rights instruments ratified by Zimbabwe.
