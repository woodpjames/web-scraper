The UN Committee Against Torture (UNCAT)
reviewed the Holy See on 5 and 6 May 2014 as part of UNCAT’s 52nd
session. A number of NGOs, including the World
Organization Against Torture (OMCT) and Child Rights International (CRIN), advocated for UNCAT to include
child sexual abuse in the Catholic Church as part of the Holy See’s review, as
a result the issue was widely discussed during the session.
 
As part of our efforts to be transparent the OMCT and
CRIN decided to publish the unofficial notes taken during the session.
 
All official
documentation, including alternative reports by other NGOs, can be found on the UNCAT’s session page.
