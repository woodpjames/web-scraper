The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint
programme of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World
Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent intervention in the
following situation in Sudan.
Description of the situation:
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the arbitrary arrest and judicial harassment of
Mr. Adil Bakheit, member of the Board of Trustees of the Sudan Human
Rights Monitor (SHRM) by the National Intelligence and Security Services
(NISS). Mr. Bakheit, a human rights trainer, also played an important
monitoring role during the 2010 elections and 2011 referendum in Sudan.
According to the information received, on April
16, 2015, at approximately 11 a.m. Mr. Bakheit was arrested in Karthoum by the
NISS and has been held at the Al Awasat police station since then.
Later that day, the State security prosecution
office announced it had filed a criminal case against Mr. Bakheit under the
1991 Criminal Act, on charges of “criminal joint acts in execution of criminal
conspiracy”, (Article 21), “criminal conspiracy” (Article 24), “calling for
opposition to public authority by use of violence or criminal force” (Article
63), “publication of false news” (Article 66) and “impersonating a public
servant” (Article 93). Two additional charges brought up against Mr. Bakheit -
“offences against the State undermining the constitutional system” (Article
50), “waging war against the State” (Article 51) - are classified as crimes
against the State and carry the death penalty.
Three weeks prior to his arrest, on March 26,
the laptop of Mr. Bakheit, which contains information about his human rights
work, was confiscated when the NISS raided a workshop organised by the
Khartoum-based TRACKS for Training and Human Development, whilst it was hosting
a training session on social responsibility.
The
Observatory is deeply concerned for the arrest, detention
and judicial harassment of Mr. Adil Bakheit, as they only aim at sanctioning
his human rights activities. The Observatory is further concerned with Mr. Adil
Bakheit's health as he is diabetic and might not get access to proper medical
care and dietary while in custody.
The Observatory calls upon authorities in Sudan
to immediately and unconditionally release him.
Actions requested:
The Observatory urges the authorities of Sudan to: 
 i.     Immediately and
unconditionally release Mr. Adil Bakheit as his detention is arbitrary since it
only aims at sanctioning his human rights activities;
ii.   
 Guarantee in all circumstances the physical
and psychological integrity of Mr. Adil Bakheit, including by ensuring Mr.
Bakheit's access to his medication, as well as of all human rights defenders in
Sudan;
iii.   
 Put an end to any kind of harassment, including
at the judicial level, against
Mr. Adil Bakheit, as well as of all human rights defenders in
Sudan, and ensure in all circumstances that he is able to carry out his
activities without hindrances;
iv.   
 Conform in any circumstances with the provisions
of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, in particular its Article 1,
which states that “everyone has the right, individually or in association with
others, to promote the protection and realisation of human rights and
fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, and its article
12.2 which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure
the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in
association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto
or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a
consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the
present Declaration”; 
v.   
 Ensure in all circumstances respect for human
rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights
standards and international instruments ratified by Sudan.
