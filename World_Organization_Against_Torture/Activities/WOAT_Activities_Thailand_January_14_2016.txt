The order was handed down following a temporary bail request submission ahead of an indictment hearing to be held on January 18, 2016 before the same Court, for a criminal defamation and computer crimes case brought against him by the Thai pineapple processing company Natural Fruit (see background information). Thus, while the Court granted temporary bail[1] to Mr. Andy Hall, he is prohibited to leave Thailand before the case has been ruled on by the Court, unless permission is granted on a case by case basis. The criminal charges carry a maximum of seven years in prison and a fine of about 10.3 million Euros in damages.This criminal defamation and computer crimes case is only one of four criminal and civil cases filed by Natural Fruit against Andy Hall. Another three cases are also still pending.The Observatory firmly condemns the ongoing judicial harassment against Mr. Hall, as it clearly aims at sanctioning his legitimate human rights activities, and calls upon the Thai authorities to immediately and unconditionally drop all charges against him.Background information:Since February 2013, the Thai pineapple processing company Natural Fruit has filed four criminal and civil lawsuits against Mr. Hall for defamation and computer crimes in relation to Mr. Hall’s contribution to a report by the Finnish NGO Finnwatch that alleged serious labour rights abuses at the company’s factory in Prachuap Khiri Khan Province. Published in 2013, the report, Cheap has a high price: Responsibility problems relating to international private label products and food production in Thailand, gathered worker interviews in order to document labour rights violations at the factory, including child labour, underpayment of wages, confiscation of migrant workers’ travel and work documents, and failure to provide legally mandated paid sick days, holidays and leave[2].On October 29, 2014, the Phra Khanong Provincial Court dismissed the first criminal defamation case[3], due to Mr. Hall’s unlawful interrogation process under Section 120 of the Criminal Procedure Code[4]. However, the Attorney General Office subsequently appealed the court’s dismissal of the case. On September 18, 2015, the appeal was dismissed. In December 2015, Natural Fruit and Thailand’s Attorney General were given a permission to appeal to the Supreme Court on this case.On August 24, 2015, the Bangkok South Criminal Court indicted Mr. Hall under Article 14(1) of the Computer Crimes Act and Article 328 of the Thai Criminal Code in a case of criminal defamation and computer crimes, another case brought against him by Natural Fruit. He was detained while awaiting trial.Actions requested:Please write to the Thai authorities asking them to:i. Drop all charges against Mr. Andy Hall and put an end to all acts of judicial harassment against him and all human rights defenders in Thailand; ii. Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Andy Hall, as well as that of all human rights defenders in Thailand; iii.
