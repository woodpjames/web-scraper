Case LKA 160212
Abduction/ Fear for the safety and the physical and
psychological integrity
The
International Secretariat of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT)
requests your URGENT intervention in the following situation in Sri Lanka.
Brief description of the situation
The International Secretariat of
OMCT has been informed by a reliable source about the abduction and disappearance since 11 February 2012 of Mr. Ramasamy Prabaharan, a 42-year-old Tamil businessman, who
filed a case against the police for torture, unlawful arrest and detention.
OMCT fears for his safety. 
According to the information
received, on 11 February 2012 at around 3.30 pm, Mr. Ramasamy Prabaharan
was abducted outside his home, in Colombo, by seven armed men in plain clothes,
who had hidden in the compound of his residence. He was reportedly grabbed by
his neck and forced into a white van with the registration n° 254-2106. The van
then took the direction of the suburban town of Dehiwela. 
According
to the same information received, Mrs. Prabaharan went on the same day to the
Wallewathe Police station to file a complaint on the abduction of her husband
(recorded under the number 224/222/GCIB). Later that day, she received a call
from her husband’s mobile number. The caller, who was speaking in Tamil, reportedly
asked for money. Mrs. Prabaharan immediately informed the police. At the time
of issuing this urgent appeal, the whereabouts and fate of Mr. Ramasamy Prabaharan were unknown. 
OMCT
has been informed that, at the time of the abduction, Mr. Ramasamy Prabaharan
had filed a fundamental rights application with the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka
against senior police officers, the Attorney General and eight others, alleging
torture, unlawful arrest and detention. Mr. Ramasamy Prabaharan had been
detained on suspicion of being a member of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Ealam
(LTTE) from May 2009 to September 2011, when he was released due to lack of
evidence. He had reportedly been extensively tortured during his detention. 
The
Supreme Court had granted leave to proceed and the hearing was to begin on 13
February 2012.
Mr. Ramasamy Prabaharan was abducted two days before the fundamental rights
petition was to be supported in the courts. 
The
International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned about the safety of Mr. Ramasamy
Prabaharan, as
his whereabouts and fate remain unknown. OMCT fears that his adduction is
linked to the fundamental rights petition he filed. OMCT urges the competent
authorities to immediately locate and disclose his whereabouts, as well as guarantee
his physical and psychological integrity at all times, in accordance with
international human rights law, in particular the Convention against Torture and Other
Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.

provided by law; 
iv.
