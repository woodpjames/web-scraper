Brief description of the facts :  The Observatory has been informed of new acts of harassment against the Kyrgyz Committee for Human Rights (KCHR).  According to the information received, the property of the KCHR was confiscated on 29th May, 2001 by bailiffs, including 3 computers, a copy machine and a fax in the Bishkek office and one computer in the Talas office. This confiscation is based on several decisions of justice confirmed by the Urban Court of Bishkek on 24th May. Some material had already been confiscated on 14th March. As a consequence, it has become very difficult for the KCHR to pursue its work, and the current activities of the office in Bishkek are for now paralysed.  Moreover, on 31th May, the Pervomay Court of Bishkek sentenced the KCHR to pay a 1600 US$-fine to Mr. Eliseev. Mr. Eliseev, a former collaborator of the KCHR, who was fired for non-authorised absences in December 1997, has filed numerous charges against the Committee, accusing it, in particular, to have confiscated his work record. As a result of these numerous complaints, the KCHR has been sentenced to pay a global amount of 8000 US$, in a period of 4 years.  The Observatory has finally been informed that the Pervomay Court of Bishkek is investigating the claim of S. Botaliev to consider the legal registration of KCHR from 20th June 1996 as invalid. S. Botaliev had been placed at the head of a fictional Committee, when the KCHR had been denied its legal status in September 1998 and replaced by a bogus organisation until August 1999.  Those facts are one further illustration of the instrumentalisation of justice by the Kyrgyz authorities with the aim to annihilating the capacity of action of the KCHR. (See also Observatory appeal KGZ 001/0005/ OBS 036 and follow-ups and the 2000 Human Rights Defenders Report, pp. 152-156)  Action requested :  Please write to the Kyrgyz authorities demanding that they :   i. put an end to all forms of harassment of human rights defenders and their organisations, in particular the current legal proceedings against the KCHR and its members;  ii. ensure the implementation of the provisions of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 9, 19998, in particular its article 1 which provides that "every person has the right, individually or collectively, to promote the protection and fulfilment of human rights and fundamental liberties at the national and international level."  iii. Guarantee the effective respect of fundamental rights and liberties in accordance with the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the international and regional pacts and covenants ratified by Kyrgyzstan.
