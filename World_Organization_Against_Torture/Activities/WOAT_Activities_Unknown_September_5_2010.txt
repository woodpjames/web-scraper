Working together for change
 
This publication is intended to help NGOs
combat torture and other forms of violence by providing guidance on the
preparation of alternative reports on the economic, social and cultural root
causes of torture and violence to UN treaty bodies.
 
The purpose of these
alternative reports is to raise awareness of the economic, social and cultural
root causes of torture and other forms of violence in a national context and,
above all, to promote change by
influencing the Committee’s concluding observations and recommendations to the
government. These, in turn, can be powerful tools for national action to
improve respect for human rights.
 
For more information, see OMCT’s economic,
social and cultural rights website.
