Description of the situation:The Observatory received information from the Human Rights Society in Uzbekistan (HRSU) about the arbitrary detention of Mr. Ikhtior Khamroev, the son of Mr. Bakhtior Khamroev, head of the Djizak section of HRSU, and a second-year student at the Technological University of Djizak.  According to the information received, on July 23, 2006, after he went out from his house in Djizak to buy some bread, a group of young men began to insult Mr. Ikhtior Khamroev. He tried not to care about them and continued to walk but the insults became more violent and Mr. Khamroev was then severely beaten by the men. Nor Mr. Ikhtior Khamroev nor his parents decided to complain about those acts.  However, on August 2, 2006 the police of Djizak arrested him and opened an inquiry against him by. Interrogated during more than eight hours without having access to a lawyer, he was then charged with “hooliganism” under article 277 of the Uzbek Criminal Code (Chapter XX: Crimes against public order), and is facing from 5 to 8 years of prison. At this date, he is still detained.   On August 8, 2006, Mr. Bakhtior Khamroev was summoned by Mr. Akram Isamov, a police investigator, to be interrogated as a witness in the case involving his son.  The Observatory expresses its deep concern about Mr. Ikhtior Khamroev’s detention, which appears to be aimed at sanctioning his father’s human rights activities. Mr. Bakhtior Khamroev’s work consists in leading actions such as monitoring, legal proceedings and demonstrations in favour of the rights of smallholders, as well as denouncing violence and torture committed against citizens at Djizak high-ranking officials’ bidding. In this regard, the Observatory considers Mr. Ikhtior Khamroev’s detention as arbitrary.   The Observatory recalls that, on May 22, 2005, the home of Mr. Bakhtior Khamroev had been broken into by a group of seventy people, under the orders of Mr. Ubdibulla Yamankulov, head of the Administration of the Djizak region. He and other members of his family had been beaten, threatened with death and insulted (See Observatory Annual Report 2005).  The Observatory reiterates its deepest concern regarding the systematic repression of human rights’ defenders in Uzbekistan and the constant deterioration of their situation, in particular since the events of Andijan occurred on May 13, 2005.  Actions required:Please write to the Uzbek authorities urging them to:  i. Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Messrs. Ikhtior Khamroev and Bakhtior Khamroev, and their family;  ii. Release M. Ikhtior Khamroev immediately and unconditionally since his detention is arbitrary;  iii. Put an end to all acts of harassment against them as well as all other human rights defenders in Uzbekistan;   iv. Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels” and article 12.2, which states that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration;  v. Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by Uzbekistan.
