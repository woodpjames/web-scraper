The hunger strike was being staged at a place which was just half a kilometre away from the hospital where she was kept as a prisoner for 14 years. During her arrest, Ms. Sharmila was violently dragged from the fast site by a team led by the Superintendent of Police (SP) of Imphal East. In the action by the police personnel, they injured and broke Ms. Sharmila’s right big toe nail and her clothes were ripped off from her body as she protested the police actions. There was no arrest memo served on her, and the police provided no specific reason for the arbitrary detention.The Observatory recalls that Ms. Sharmila is physically frail and fragile as she has been on hunger strike since November 2000. According to reliable information, the police have taken Ms. Sharmila to the Jawaharlal Nehru Institute of Medical Sciences (JNIMS) Hospital in Porompat, Imphal East, where she has been given some medical attention for her injuries and then admitted in the special ward under police custody.The Observatory denounces the ongoing arbitrary detention of Ms. Irom Sharmila Chanu, which seems aimed at sanctioning her human rights activities, in particular her peaceful protest against the AFSPA, and fears for her physical and psychological integrity. The Observatory therefore urges the Indian authorities to put an end to her ongoing detention.Background information Ms. Irom Sharmila Chanu began her hunger strike after the "Malon massacre" of November 2, 2000, in which members of the Assam Rifles shot down ten suspected insurgents at a bus stop near Imphal, in Manipur, India. This event illustrates the abuses generated by the AFSPA, which entered into force in 1958 and gives the Indian army full powers in areas affected by armed uprising, notably in Kashmir and in the north-eastern States, including Manipur, where separatists rebels are present. In particular, the AFSPA empowers soldiers to arrest, keep in detention, and shoot at any person so as to “maintain public order” if the soldier has reasons to believe that such person is an “insurgent” (Section 4.a) . These actions can be carried out with total impunity, as the law requires the permission from the central Government to prosecute a member of the army. Ms. Sharmila was arrested for the first time in November 2000 for “attempting suicide”, which is unlawful under Section 309 of the Indian Penal Code, and has refused to eat or drink since then. Over the past 14 years, the Indian authorities have regularly imposed forced nasal feeding on Ms. Sharmila. According to the Indian Penal Code, the maximum sentence for the charge of "attempting suicide" is one year in detention. Ms. Sharmila has thus been released from detention every year, and has been subsequently re-arrested shortly afterwards again for the same reasons. Actions requested: Please write to the authorities in India, urging them to: i.      Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Ms. Irom Sharmila Chanu as well as of all human rights defenders in India;ii.     Release Ms. Irom Sharmila Chanu immediately and unconditionally, since her detention is arbitrary as it only aims at sanctioning her human rights activities;iii.   Put an end to all acts of harassment - including at the judicial level - against Ms. Irom Sharmila Chanu as well as against all human rights defenders in India so that they are able to carry out their work without hindrances;iv.    Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially:-        Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”-        Article 12.2, which provides that “"the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”; v.    More generally, ensure in all circumstances the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with international and regional human rights instruments ratified by India.Addresses: ·       Mr. Shri Nanredra Damodardas Modi, Prime Minister of India, Prime Minister’s Office, Room number 152, South Block, New Delhi, India.
