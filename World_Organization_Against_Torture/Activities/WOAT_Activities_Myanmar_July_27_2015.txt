URGENT APPEAL - THE OBSERVATORY

MMR 004 / 0715 / OBS 061Arbitrary arrest and detentionBurma / MyanmarJuly 24, 2015The Observatory for the
Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the International
Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation Against Torture
(OMCT), requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in Burma/Myanmar.
Brief description of the
situation:
The Observatory has been
informed by reliable sources about the arbitrary arrest of  leader of the
Myanmar Farmers Union Ms.Su
Su Nway.
According to the
information received, on July 23, 2015, Ms. Su Su Nway was arrested by police
in Intagaw, Pegu Township, Pegu Division, after meeting with farmers involved
in a land confiscation dispute on her way back to Rangoon. Ms. Su Su Nway had
been meeting with farmers who were seeking the return of land that the military
had confiscated from them in Nyaunglebin Township in 2003.
The same day, a court in
Pegu Division charged Ms. Su Su Nway under Article 447 of the Criminal Code
(trespassing) and sent her to Pegu Prison. Ms. Su Su Nway denied the charges
and turned down bail, which had been granted by the court.
In early June, police in
Intagaw informed Ms. Su Su Nway that a local Army commander, Captain Hein Zaw,
had filed charges against her for trespassing. She had refused to answer the
charge.Her trial is set to begin on July 29, 2015.
Ms. Su Su Nway has
previously been detained on various occasions between 2005 and 2007. She was
eventually released along with hundreds of other political prisoners during a
October 12, 2011 presidential amnesty.
The Observatory condemns
the arrest and judicial harassment of Ms. Su Su Nway, which seem merely aimed
at sanctioning her peaceful human rights activities, and calls upon the Burmese
authorities to release her immediately and unconditionally.
Actions requested:
Please write to the
Burmese authorities, urging them to:
i.             
Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of all
human rights defenders in Burma, including Ms. Su Su Nway;
ii.            
Immediately and unconditionally release Ms. Su Su Nway since her detention is
arbitrary and only aimed at sanctioning her human rights activities;
iii.           
Put an end to acts of any acts of harassment, including at the judicial level,
against Ms. Su Su Nwayand all human rights defenders in Burma;
iv.           
Comply with all the provisions of the United Nations Declaration on Human
Rights Defenders, in particular with its:
-         
Article 1, which stipulates that “everyone has the right, individually and in association
with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realization of
human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international
levels”;
-         
Article 12.1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in
association with others, to participate in peaceful activities against
violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms”;
-         
Article 12.2, which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures
to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually
and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse
discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his
or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present
Declaration”;
v.            
More generally, ensure in all circumstances the respect for human rights and
fundamental freedoms in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights, and ratify international and regional human rights instruments.
