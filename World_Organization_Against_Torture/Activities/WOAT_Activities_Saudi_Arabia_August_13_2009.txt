Description of the situation: The Observatory has been informed by the Arab Program for Human Rights Activists (APHRA) about the ongoing obstacles to the freedom of movement of Mr. Mohamed Saleh Al Bejadi, a Saudi human rights defender and supervisor of the website Monitor of Human Rights in Saudi Arabia-Al-Marsad. According to the information received, on July 23, 2009, the passport authorities in Barida informed Mr. Mohamed Saleh Al Bejadi that he continued to be banned from travelling outside Saudi Arabia. In March 2009, Mr. Mohamed Saleh Al Bejadi had been summoned to the Intelligence Police (Mukhabrat) department and interrogated about his relationship with Internet reports and protest activities which had called for democratic reforms and the release of detainees. On this occasion, his passport was confiscated. Since then, Mohamed Saleh Al Bejadi has been prevented from travelling. The Observatory denounces these obstacles to the freedom of movement imposed on Mr. Mohamed Saleh Al Bejadi, which only aim at muzzling his freedom of expression and sanctioning his human rights activities. The Observatory also points out that Mr. Mohamed Saleh Al Bejadi was arrested on September 4, 2007 after calling through statements to foreign satellite channels and news agencies for a for a sit-in in front of the district governorate to call for the release of detainees. He was detained in solitary confinement without charge or trial until his release, on January 1, 2008, on the condition that he would not organise any fora or gatherings, nor contact any foreign press.
