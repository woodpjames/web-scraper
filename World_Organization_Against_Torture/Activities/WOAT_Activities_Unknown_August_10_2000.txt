New information :  The Observatory was informed by the Palestinian Society for the Protection for Human Rights and the Environment (LAW), of threats and attempt of assault against Khader Shkirat, LAW’s Director General and agressive remarks regarding the work of Palestinian human rights organisations.  According to the information received, on 7th August 2000, Khader Shkirat met with Ramallah Police Commander, Major Kamal al Sheikh, regarding the ill-treatment and torture of detainees and the reasons for banning visits of LAW’s lawyers to various detainees. During the meeting, Major al Sheikh justified the beating of detainees by saying, “The thief who does not confess must be beaten as a last resort to force him to confess”.  Shkirat explained that this violated Palestinian Law and that torture and ill-treatment is absolutely prohibited. Al Sheikh reacted with derogatory and aggressive remarks against Palestinian human rights organisations claiming that, “they do not work against occupation and their loyalty is only towards the foreign donors.”  Major al Sheikh then threatened Shkirat and told him that he would detain him. When Al Sheikh asked his guards to take Shkirat out of the police headquarters by force, they tried to assault him.  Moreover, on 10th August 2000, Khader Shkirat received a notice from Ghazi Alhjhbali, the Chief of the Palestinian Police, forbidding him to visit Palestinian prisons.  The Observatory is gravely concerned by these facts, which violate the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders adopted on 9th December by the General Assembly of the United Nations, in particular its article 9.c which mandates that « everyone has the right, individually or in association with others, to offer and provide professionally qualified legal assistance or other relevant advice and assistance in defending human rights and fundamental freedoms ».  Action Requested :  Please write to the Palestinian authorities urging that they :  i.-     put an end to all threats and harassment against Khader Shkirat, and against any other organisation or person working to promote and defend human rights;  ii.     ensure the application of the provisions of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 9th 1998, particularly with respect to the protection of the right of "everyone individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels"(Art.1), as well as article 9.c (see above).  iii.    more generally abide by the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the regional and international covenants.
