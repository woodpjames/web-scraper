OMCT supported Afghan
civil society in engaging with CAT’s review of Afghanistan during its 60th
session in 2017. As a follow up to this endeavor, OMCT would like to support an
Afghan civil society organisation in arranging a roundtable discussion with
members from Afghan civil society and the
subsequent drafting of a follow-up shadow report,[1]
striving towards domestic implementation of the Convention Against Torture. See the terms of reference under 'Attachments' for more information.
