Acts 
of intimidation / Death threats
Zimbabwe

The 
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of 
the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation 
Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent intervention in the following 
situation in Zimbabwe.
 
Description 
of the situation:
The 
Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about threats against Mr. 
Bamusi Kasembe, focal person in the Maramba community for Zimbabwe Human 
Rights Association (ZIMRIGHTS) and his assistant known as Tongai, and 
about the acts of intimidation against 11 researchers, among them Messrs. 
Dzikamai Bere, from the Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum and Admire 
Munava, a member of ZIMRIGHTS. 
According 
to the information received, on March 18, 2011, the 13 human rights defenders 
were travelling by combi from the capital Harare, through the Mashonaland East 
province. They were stopped by a roadblock manned by alleged ZANU-PF party 
loyalists (Zimbabwe African National Union Patriotic Front) in the Maramba 
community, part of the Uzumba Maramba Pfugwe district. 
The 
ZANU-PF activists, who were carrying stones, canes and logs, questioned the 
human rights defenders about their motives and threatened them that they will 
take action if they misbehave. The group managed to escape from the scene using 
a safer and different route. Mr. Bamusi Kazembe and his assistant had to spend 
the following night hiding in the bush. They feared to be attacked in their 
homes as they were death threatened by the ZANU-PF activists during the 
incident. 
The 
team of human rights defenders was then working on a research in Mashonaland 
East province about the people's views on the results of the National Healing 
and Reconciliation process since the state political repression that followed 
the 2008 presidential elections and the possibility of an election due to take 
place later this year.
The 
Observatory is concerned that these threats and acts of intimidation form part 
of a continued harassment against human rights defenders in the country[1], 
in a political context more and more tense in consequence of the run-up to the 
referendum on the Constitution and the parliamentary elections due in 2011, and particularly against the civic groups 
promoting a free election process. 
The 
Observatory strongly condemns these acts of intimidation and harassment against 
the 13 human rights defenders, and particularly fears for the psychological and 
physical integrity of Mr. Bamusi Kazembe and his assistant. 

Furthermore, 
the Observatory calls upon the Zimbabwe authorities to immediately take the 
necessary measures to guarantee the protection of Mr. Bamusi Kazembe and his 
assistant as well as to put an end to any acts of harassment against all the 
human rights defenders in the country since they aim at sanctioning their human 
rights activities. 
 
Actions 
requested:
 Please 
write to the authorities of Zimbabwe asking them to:
 i.      
Guarantee 
in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Messrs.

Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum and ZIMRIGHTS as well as all human rights 
defenders in the country;
 ii.     
Put 
an end to any kinds of harassment against members of the Zimbabwe Human Rights 
NGO Forum and ZIMRIGHTS as well as against all human rights defenders in 
Zimbabwe; 
 iii.

association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and 
realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and

on the observance, both in law and in practice, of all human rights and 
fundamental freedoms and, through these and other appropriate means, to draw 
public attention to those matters”.
- 
and its Article 12.2, which provides that “the State shall take all necessary 
measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, 
individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, 
retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other 
arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the 
rights referred to in the present Declaration”; 
 iv.    
More 
generally, ensure in all circumstances the respect for human rights and
