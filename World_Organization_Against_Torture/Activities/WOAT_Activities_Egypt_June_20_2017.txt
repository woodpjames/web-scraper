The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a partnership of FIDH
and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent
intervention in the following situation in Egypt.


Description of the situation:

The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the arrest, arbitrary
detention and ill-treatment of Mr. Tarek
Hussein (known as Tito), human rights activist and lawyer at the Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR)[1].
 
According to the
information received, on June 17, 2017, at dawn fifteen masked officers and
plain clothes officers from the Central Security Forces stormed out Mr. Tarek
Hussein’s house, arrested him and confiscated his laptop and cell phone. During
his arrest, Mr. Tarek Hussein requested to see the arrest warrant but was not
shown any and was physically and verbally assaulted instead, including upon his
arrival at Khanka’s police station.
 
He was subsequently
brought before the Al-Khanka District Prosecution, where he was accused of “joining an illegal organization” and “calling for a protest”.
 
On June 18, 2017, the
Al-Khanka District Prosecution ordered Mr. Tarek Hussein’s release on a 2000
EGP (approx. 99 euros) bail, which has been duly paid. However, as of
publication of this appeal the latter had not been released yet and is still
held at Khanka’s police station.

In addition, allegations of ill-treatment including physical and verbal assault
were reported while in detention. It has been reported that Mr. Tarek Hussein
is being detained in poor conditions which include sharing an overcrowded cell
with eighty co-detainees, and being denied food and changing clothes for two
consecutive days. Mr. Hussein’s relatives, who have been in contact with the
prison’s authorities, were told that “he deserves to die”.
 
Mr. Tarek Hussein’s
arrest and arbitrary detention occur amidst protest over Tiran and Sanafir
islands’ transfer to Saudi Arabia, which he has been vocally opposing[2].

 
The Observatory is
extremely concerned about the ongoing arbitrary detention of Mr. Tarek Hussein
despite the Court order to release him on bail. The Observatory believes his
arrest and arbitrary detention are linked to his human rights activities and
consequently urges Egyptian authorities to immediately and unconditionally
release him, and withdraw the accusations against him. 
                                                                        
Actions requested:

Please write to the authorities of Egypt asking them to:
 
      
i.        
Immediately and unconditionally release Mr. Tarek Hussein as
well as all human rights defenders arbitrarily detained in Egypt;
 
     
ii.        
Put an end to all acts of harassment, including at the
judicial level, against Mr. Tarek Hussein as well as against all human rights
defenders in Egypt;
 
    
iii.        
Conform with the provisions of the UN
Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the
United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially Articles 1, 6(c) and 12.2; 
 
   
iv.        
More generally, ensure in all circumstances the
respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with international and regional human
rights instruments ratified by Egypt.
