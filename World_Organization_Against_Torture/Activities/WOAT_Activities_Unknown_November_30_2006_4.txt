The purpose of this publication is to provide practical advice to persons wishing to bring individual complaints concerning violations of the prohibition of torture and other forms of ill-treatment before the Inter-American Human Rights System. As such, the Handbook provides an accessible and comprehensive guide to the practice and procedure of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, as well as a detailed analysis of the substantive law developed by the Commission and Court concerning torture and ill-treatment. The combined treatment of procedure and substance reflects the reality that – as in other areas of law – the two are frequently interlinked: procedural strategies in a particular case will reflect the scope of the applicable substantive law, and procedural rules will necessarily shape the type of legal arguments advanced by applicants. Reference materials such as the relevant conventions and reports of the OAS human rights institutions, Amicus Curiae briefs and sample submissions made by parties in actual cases are included in the appendices as a further resource for litigants. This book is available in English, español & português.
