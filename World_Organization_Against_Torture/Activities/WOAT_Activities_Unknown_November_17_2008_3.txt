According to the information received, on November 12, 2008, the Revolutionary Court of Tehran sentenced in appeal Mr. Youssef Azizi Bani-Torof to five years of imprisonment for having criticised the repression of the Arab speaking population in Ahvaz city, Khuzestan, in April 2005. As of issuing this urgent appeal, Mr. Youssef Azizi Bani-Torof remained free pending his appeal before the Supreme Court. Mr. Youssef Azizi Bani-Torof had been arrested on April 25, 2005 after his participation to a peace conference in which he condemned the excessive use of force against participants to demonstrations that took place on April 15, 2005, in Ahvaz, to denounce the increase in discrimination and suppression of cultural rights faced by the Arab population in Khuzestan. After being detained during 50 days in the Evin prison, he was released on a one billion Rial bail. On August 10, 2008, more than three years later, he was sentenced to five years in prison and then lodged an appeal against the decision. The Observatory expresses its deep concern about Mr. Youssef Azizi Bani-Torof’s harsh sentencing as it seems to merely sanction his activities of promotion of human rights principles and strongly condemns the increasing repression of the Iranian authorities against human rights defenders. The Observatory further wishes to remind that Iran made a commitment to “uphold the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights”[1] by presenting its candidacy to the Human Rights Council 2006 election, and had insisted in this regard that the country has “continuously put great efforts into safeguarding the status and inherent dignity of the human person as well as the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms”[2]; however the conviction of Mr. Bani-Torof for simply defending human rights, as well as the processes leading to the conviction, such as his two month detentions, contradict such a commitment and undo such efforts. Actions requested: Please write to the authorities in Iran urging them to:   Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Youssef Azizi Bani-Torof;  Respect in all circumstances his right to a fair trial according to international human rights standards;  Put an end to all acts of harassment - including at the judicial level - against Mr. Youssef Azizi Bani-Torof as well as against all Iranian human rights defenders;  Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, Article 6 (b) which stipulates that “everyone has the right […] freely to publish, impart or disseminate to others views, information and knowledge on all human rights and fundamental freedoms”, as well as Article 12(2), which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”;  Ensure in all circumstances the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with international and regional human rights instruments ratified by the Islamic Republic of Iran.
