Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel (PCATI), a member of the OMCT network, of the fear of torture of three South Lebanese Prisoners.  According to the information received, Mohammed As'ad Yassin, aged 29, Lebanese Red Cross volunteer from Dibbin, Muhsin Nasrallah, aged 35, a construction worker from 'Aynata and Aba-Dharr Shugeir, aged 23, a student from Mays Al-Jabal were arrested in the village of Aainata in South Lebanon on October 7, 1999.  It is reported that they were arrested by members of the South Lebanon Army (SLA) and the Israeli Army and are believed to be detained in Khiam Detention Centre, infamous in its reputation of systematic torture and ill-treatment of detainees.  The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned for the physcial and psychological integrity of these three persons, given the harsh conditions of detention at the Khiam Detention Camp.  OMCT underlines that the detention of these three people is the responsibility of the Israeli authorities and urges them to uphold their right to legal counsel and to a fair and impartial trial and their physical and psychological integrity, as established, inter alia, in the Convention against Torture and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, both ratified by Israel.  Action requested  Please write to the authorities in Israel urging them to:  i.	take all necessary measures to guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of the above-mentioned persons; ii.	order their immediate release in the absence of valid legal charges or, if such charges exist, bring them before an impartial and competent tribunal and guarantee their procedural rights at  all times; iii.	guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards, particularly the Convention against Torture.
