September 2016
Dear members of the IAP
Executive Committee and the Senate,
 
The undersigned
organisations appeal to you to take steps to ensure prosecutors comply with the
Standards of Professional Responsibility
and Statement of the Essential Duties and Rights of Prosecutors[1].

 
By fighting crime in
a professional and legal manner, prosecutors play an essential role in
protecting the rights and freedoms of the inhabitants of the country they are
serving. We recognise the commitment and sacrifice that in many cases are
required from prosecutors to fulfil this role in a proper manner. 
 
At the same time, we
observe situations in which prosecutors are involved in procedures and
prosecutions that violate basic rights laid down in the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights and subsequent international covenants, conventions and other
instruments, to which the Standards of
Professional Responsibility and Statement of the Essential Duties and Rights of
Prosecutors[2]
as well as national professional ethical standards refer. 
 
A particularly worrying
development is the increase in the prosecution of Human Rights Defenders
(persons and organisations covered by the 1998 UN Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and
Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights
and Fundamental Freedoms[3]).
The UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights Defenders in 2013 reported that she
had seen “the space for civil society and defenders visibly shrink in certain
regions of the world”, accompanied by “the consolidation of more sophisticated
forms of silencing of their voices and impeding their work, including the
application of legal and administrative provisions or the misuse of the
judicial system to criminalise and stigmatise their activities.”[4]
 
The precise role of
prosecution services and individual prosecutors in these practices depends on
the design of the judiciary system in the respective countries, but in most if
not all cases they will be in direct violation of key provisions of the Standards of Professional Responsibility and
Statement of the Essential Duties and Rights of Prosecutors. The
International Association of Prosecutors should in our view urgently develop
procedures to address this gap between professional ethics and practice[5].

Prosecutors with Professional Standards 
 
 
The Hague, 20 August 2016
 
 
Following measures
are suggested as a possible model to uphold compliance of the IAP members with
the Standards of Professional
Responsibility and Statement of the Essential Duties and Rights of Prosecutors:
 
-      To initiate a dialogue in the IAP on the
introduction of a transparent monitoring and reporting cycle or audit
procedures to review performance of existing institutional/ country members
against the standards to which they have committed when joining the IAP; 
 
-      To introduce a complaint mechanism when
actions of individual IAP members are concerned, accessible to members of the
public affected by their actions, as well as human rights groups and civil
society organisations;
 
-      To establish a provisional or “on-hold
membership” status for IAP members that have been proven to fail to live up to
human rights obligations, embedded in the IAP membership commitments;
 
-      To open up channels of communication and
information-sharing with civil society organisations, including through
providing a possibility of reporting for coalitions of NGOs during the IAP
annual conferences, as well as through an “urgent appeal” procedure to the IAP
Executive Committee in situations where the IAP members can play a role in
preventing grave human rights abuse;
 
-      To initiate a special interest group or
committee within the IAP focusing on challenges and responses in dealing with
prosecution of Human Rights Defenders, protected by international standards,
and other serious human rights violations.

[1] Standards of Professional Responsibility and Statement
of the Essential Duties and Rights of Prosecutors adopted by the
International Association of Prosecutors on 23 April 1999. 


[2]  Most situations relate to the right to a fair trial (Article
14 of the International Covenant on Civil
and Political Rights) and the right to freedom from torture including the prohibition
of the use in any proceedings of statements made as a result of torture
(Article 15, Convention against Torture
and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment). Additionally,
obligations that are often neglected include refusal to use evidence reasonably
believed to have been obtained through recourse to unlawful methods that constitute
a human rights violation, as well as the duty to investigate and prosecute
human rights violations by public officials, as per Guidelines 16 and 15 of the
UN Guidelines on the Role of Prosecutors Adopted by the Eighth United Nations
Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders, Havana,
Cuba, 27 August to 7 September 1990.
