Brief description of the situation The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by a reliable source and Antenna International, member organisation of OMCT SOS-Torture Network, about the forced eviction and later detention of Beijing-based housing rights activist and former lawyer, Mrs. Ni Yulan (47 years old). Furthermore, she is reportedly detained incommunicado since 4 July 2008 raising fears about her conditions of detention. According to the information received, on 15 April 2008, dozens of workers and police knocked down a wall of Mrs. Ni Yulan’s home. Police alleged that Mrs. Ni Yulan beat a member of the demolition crew when trying to stop them. Mrs. Ni Yulan reportedly did not receive any notification regarding the demolition of her home. According to the same information, on 29 April 2008, Mrs. Ni Yulan was formally arrested on suspicion of "obstructing official business" by the Beijing Public Security Bureau (PSB) Xicheng District Sub-division. It is reported that, soon after she was taken into police custody on 15 April 2008, Mrs. Ni Yulan was allegedly beaten and ill-treated at Xinjiekou Police Station in Beijing. Police reportedly confiscated her crutches and made her crawl when she had to use the bathroom. They further kicked her so severely that she reportedly fell unconscious for two days. Mrs. Ni Yulan was transferred on 17 April 2008 to Xicheng District Detention Center. Her current condition is unknown as her family and lawyer were denied access since 4 July 2008. Moreover, while her trial was originally scheduled on 4 August 2008, it was reportedly abruptly postponed. According to Article 277 of the Chinese Criminal Law, Mrs. Ni Yulan risks three years of fixed-term imprisonment, criminal detention, or control; or a sentence of a fine. Mrs. Ni Yulan is known for her work assisting many victims of forced eviction in Beijing, many of whom were forced to move to make way for the Olympics facilities without fair compensation. On 27 April 2002, for filming the forced demolition of a Beijing home, Mrs. Ni Yulan was reportedly beaten by police. The beating left the former lawyer disabled being unable to walk without crutches. On 27 September 2002, she was arrested when petitioning the Beijing National People's Congress Standing Committee about the police beating. She was convicted of "obstructing official business" and sentenced to one year in prison. The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned for the safety of Mrs. Ni Yulan, whose condition is currently unknown. OMCT fears that she may be subject to torture and ill-treatment. OMCT recalls that China is a State party to the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment which prohibits torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. In line with their obligations under this treaty, it is incumbent on the Chinese authorities to consider seriously any allegations of torture and ill-treatment, and to undertake a thorough and impartial investigation in this regard. OMCT urges the authorities to conform with China’s international human rights obligations, commitments that were reaffirmed on the occasion of its election as a member of the new United Nations Human Rights Council. Actions Requested Please write to the authorities in the People’s Republic of China urging them to:   Guarantee, in all circumstances, the physical and psychological integrity of Mrs. Ni Yulan;  Guarantee immediate and unconditional access to her lawyer, her family and any medical treatment she may require;  Order her immediate release in the absence of valid legal charges, or, if such charges exist, bring her before an impartial, independent, competent and fair tribunal and guarantee her procedural rights at all times;  Order a thorough and impartial investigation into these events in order to identify all those responsible, bring them to trial and apply the penal and/or administrative sanctions as provided by law;  Guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
