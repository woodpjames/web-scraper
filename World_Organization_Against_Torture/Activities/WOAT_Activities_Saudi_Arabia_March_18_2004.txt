Brief description of the situation:  The Observatory has been informed by a reliable source of the arrest and detention of a group of eleven individuals, including human rights defenders.  The individuals arrested on March 15, 2004, and subsequently released on March 17, 2004 are the following:  -	Adnan Al-Shakhess, a professor at King Fahad university and political reformist. -	Matrouk Al-Faleh, a professor at King Saud university in Riyadh and a political activist, arrested from his office at the university. -	Abd Rab Al-Ameer Mussa Al-Bukhamseen, a human rights activist, arrested from his work place at a bank in Riyadh. -	Khalid Al-Hameed, a professor at King Saud university in Riyadh city and arrested from his office at the university.  The individuals arrested on March 15, 2004, and who remain in detention at the General Intelligence (al-Mabahith al-amma) in Riyadh, are the following:  -	Abdulla Al-Hamad, a professor at Imam Mohamed bin Al-Saud University. Arrested at his office at the university. -	Mohammed Said Al-Taib, a human rights activist, arrested at his house in Jeddah city. -	Towfiq Al-Qaseer, a university professor, arrested at his house in Riyadh city. -	Najeeb Al-Khanizee, a writer and political activist, arrested in Al-Kateef city. -	Abdul-Rahman Alahim, a lawyer and human rights activist. He was arrested on March 17 after appearing on March 16, on Al-Jazeera satellite, calling upon the government to release all the political detainees and to take steps towards democracy and political reforms in the Kingdom. -	Ali Al-Deminy, a writer and political activist, arrested at his work place. -	Shaikh Sulaiman Al-Rashoud, a clergyman and human rights activist.  The eleven individuals were allegedly arrested for the following reasons: firstly for criticizing the lack of independence of the National Commission on Human Rights (the announcement of its creation was firstly made in May 2003 and again officially reiterated on March 9, 2004); secondly for submitting an application, shortly before their arrest, in order to form an independent human rights organisation to promote and protect human rights in Saudi Arabia; and thirdly, for actively engaging, in the last two years, in peaceful activities calling upon the government to take steps towards political reforms, democracy and the respect of human rights, including the signing of the “Constitutional Kingdom” statement addressed to the Crown Prince Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz al-Saud, in December 2003.  According to the information received, the Ministry of the Interior is willing to release all the detainees on the condition that they sign a pledge that they will cease their campaign in favour of reforms of the political and human rights situation in Saudi Arabia.  The Observatory is extremely concerned for the physical integrity of the individuals who remain in detention and urges the Saudi Arabian authorities to release them immediately and unconditionally.   Action requested:  Please write to the authorities of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia urging them to:  i.	guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of the detainees and order their immediate and unconditional release;  ii.	allow human rights defenders to form independent human rights organisations to promote and protect human rights in Saudi Arabia; iii.	conform to the provisions of the Declaration on Humans Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, in particular article 1, which states that "everyone has the right, individually or in association with others, to promote the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels"; iv.	ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards.
