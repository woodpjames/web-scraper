Brief description of the situation The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by a reliable source and Antenna International, member organisation of OMCT SOS-Torture Network, that Beijing petitioners Mrs. Wu Dianyuan (79 years old) and Mrs. Wang Xiuying (77 years old) have been ordered to serve a one-year term of Reeduction-Through-Labor (RTL) after repeatedly applying for permits to hold demonstrations in the Beijing “protest zones” during the Olympics. Both have been reportedly actively petitioning the government since they were forcibly evicted from their homes in Beijing in 2001. According to the information received, on 17 August 2008, Mrs. Wu Dianyuan and Mrs. Wang Xiuying received a RTL decision dated 30 July 2008 from the RTL Commission of the Beijing Municipal Government. The decision reportedly order them to serve one year of RTL for "disturbing the public order," from 30 July 2008 to 29 July 2009. The decision reportedly further states that the term will be served outside the RTL camp, but also places restrictions on movement and stipulates that if provisions of the decision or other regulations are violated, they will be sent to the RTL camp[1]. Mrs. Wu Dianyuan and Mrs. Wang Xiuying reportedly returned, on 18 August 2008, to the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau (PSB) Security Administration Unit and were allegedly told by the PSB officers on duty that since they had received the RTL decision the day before, they now had no right to apply for the demonstration protest. According to the same information, Mrs. Wu Dianyuan and Mrs. Wang Xiuying went to the Beijing Municipal PSB Security Administration unit five times between 5 and 18 August 2008 to apply for permits to demonstrate in the newly-designed “protest zones”. The two women, who used to be neighbours, applied to demonstrate against the forced eviction from their homes in 2001. However, their application was neither granted nor denied on each of their five trips to the Security Administration Unit. On 5 August 2008, they were allegedly held by PSB officers and interrogated for 10hours.  The International Secretariat of OMCT expresses its concern with regard the sentencing of Mrs. Wu Dianyuan and Mrs. Wang Xiuying, which, according to the information received, was based solely on their active government petitioning. OMCT further fears for their safety should they be sent to RTL. OMCT recalls that China is a State party to the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment which prohibits torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. OMCT urges the authorities to conform with China’s international human rights obligations, commitments that were reaffirmed on the occasion of its election as a member of the new United Nations Human Rights Council. Actions Requested Please write to the authorities in the People’s Republic of China urging them to:   Guarantee, in all circumstances, the physical and psychological integrity of Mrs. Wu Dianyuan and Mrs. Wang Xiuying;  Put an end to all acts of harassment, including at the judicial level, against Mrs. Wu Dianyuan and Mrs. Wang Xiuying;  Guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
