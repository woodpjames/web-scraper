New information: The Observatory has been informed about the incommunicado detention of Mr. Gao Zhisheng, a human rights lawyer and the director of the Beijing-based Shengzhi Law Office, which has taken on high-profile human rights cases, and who has been detained since August 15, 2006. According to the information received, on October 12, 2006, Mr. Gao Zhisheng’s lawyer was informed that his client had been formally arrested and charged with “inciting to subvert the state”. As a criminal defence lawyer, Mr. Gao Zhisheng represented defendants in sensitive cases involving alleged violations of human rights, such as torture of members of the Falun Gong and Christian house church leaders, as well as arbitrary detention of petitioners seeking official accountability for corruption and neglect. He also represented defendants in cases involving freedom of speech and the press. In November 2005, the activities of the Shengzhi Law Office were suspended by the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Justice for one year, and, in December 2005, Mr. Gao Zhisheng’s licence to practice law was revoked. These events followed the publication of an open letter on religious freedom. Mr. Gao’s appeal to review the decision to suspend his license was rejected. Since then, Mr. Gao had been under close police surveillance and constant harassment and intimidation. On August 15, 2006, Mr. Gao was arrested by more than 20 plainclothes officers from the Beijing Public Security Bureau at his sister’s home in Dongying City, Shandong Province, without showing any warrant or other decision by a public authority. The officers threatened Mr. Gao’s sister and told her to remain silent about Mr. Gao’s arrest. On August 18, 2006, the official Xinhua News Agency released a statement saying that Mr. Gao Zhisheng had been arrested “on suspicion of breaking the law,” although no details were provided about the specific crime he was alleged to have committed. Since then, neither his family nor his lawyer have been notified of Mr. Gao’s whereabouts. Indeed, the authorities have prevented Mr. Gao’s lawyer from visiting his client, citing that the case involves “state secrets”. The Observatory strongly condemns the incommunicado detention of Mr. Gao Zhisheng, and expresses its deep concern about his physical and psychological integrity, fearing that he may be at risk of torture and ill-treatment. Actions required: Please write to the Chinese authorities urging them to:  Guarantee in all circumstances Mr. Gao Zhisheng’s physical and psychological integrity and in particular ensure that he be not subjected to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment during his detention; Provide, with the greatest celerity, information on his whereabouts as well as on his conditions of detention; Order the immediate and unconditional release of Mr. Gao Zhisheng as his detention is arbitrary; Put en end to the harassment against all human rights defenders in China; Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, and article 12.2, which states that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”; Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by the People’s Republic of China.
