The Observatory for the
Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the World
Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and the International Federation for Human
Rights (FIDH) requests your urgent intervention
in the following situation in The Philippines.
Description of the situation:
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the
surveillance, threats, and harassment suffered by several human rights workers
at the Southern
Mindanao Region Chapter of the Alliance for the Advancement of People's Rights
(Karapatan), as well as several peasant leaders and their families victims of
human rights violations in Davao City Paquibato
District, and Bukidnon Province, Mindanao, who had sought shelter in Karapatan
office. 
Human rights defenders
targeted include Karapatan staff: Ms. Edessa
Sandra Campos and Ms. Leonora
Ricafort, together with Ms. Ricafort’s son, as well as peasant leaders: Ms. Aida
Sanduman-Seisa, Secretary General of Paquibato District Peasants Alliance
(PADIPA), Mr. Eduardo Regidor, acting Chairperson of
PADIPA,
and his three sons, Mr. Primjun
Oblianda-Cabatuan and Ms. Roselyn
Tausa, both members of PADIPA.
According to the
information received, on April 26, 2015, at 10 a.m. several men with a military
haircut and wearing light fatigue shirt and short pants, and who appeared to be
soldiers, showed up in the neighbourhoods of Karapatan
office in Davao City. The men walked back and forth on the road and stood in front of the building
trying to look through the gate at the people inside. One of
them was heard commenting by phone to an unknown interlocutor the exact
location of the NGO office and of the peasant leaders who had sought refuge
there. 
Moreover,
when Mr. Eduardo Regidor left the office with
his three sons, three men armed with 45 caliber pistols followed them and one
of them, the same one that made the phone call, told him “Aha, dito lang pala kayo nagtatago (So, you are hiding here)”.
Alarmed by the man’s statement, Eduardo and his sons flagged down a taxi, got
into the car, and instructed the driver to speed up. The three armed men also
rode their individual motorcycles and tailed the taxi, but eventually lost
track of it. 
On
April 27, after 7 p.m., Mr. Eduardo Regidor arrived at Karapatan office. A few
minutes later, three men went to the office’s gate and attempted to get inside.
One of the men carried with him something wrapped with a towel, possibly a gun.
When asked, they refused to identify themselves. When those inside the
Karapatan office did not open the gate, one of the men pushed the gate and the
two other men attempted to climb the concrete wall to get inside the compound.
One of the men was the same person who the day before was conducting
surveillance outside the Karapatan office.
The attempts of the men to barge into the
Karapatan office stopped only when a Karapatan staff member called for police
assistance and members of the media. After the media and police interview, the
police brought the Karapatan staff to the San Pedro Police Station to file a
report of the incident.
The Observatory would like to point out
that Karapatan staff members in the Southern Mindanao Region are constantly
subjected to surveillance, threats, and harassment from the military. They are
labeled by the military as “enemies of the State” and “front organisations of
the communists.” Karapatan attributes these violations to the intensification
of military operations, especially in Mindanao, where 60% of the total troops
of the Armed Forces of the Philippines are deployed under the
counter-insurgency programme Oplan Bayanihan.
The Observatory expresses its deepest
concern over the ongoing acts of harassment and surveillance faced by members
of Karapatan office in Southern Mindanao Region and peasant leaders and their
families. The Observatory calls upon the authorities to guarantee in all circumstances the physical and
psychological integrity of the members of Karapatan and peasant leaders and their
families and to conduct a swift, thorough, and impartial investigation on the
above-mentioned acts. 
The Observatory also calls upon the
authorities to immediately put an end to any form of
harassment against human rights defenders in the Philippines.
Action requested:

iii.     Put an end to any kind of harassment against the members of Karapatan
