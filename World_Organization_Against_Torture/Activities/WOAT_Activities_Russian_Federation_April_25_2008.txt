New information: The Observatory has been informed by a reliable source about the existence of a far-right website targeting human rights defenders, journalists involved in human rights issues and political opponents. According to the information received, on April 17, 2008, a worrying article was published on the extremist website www.vdesyaktu.net. In particular, this text accuses some journalists of defaming the skinheads, and its authors call on all skinheads of Russia to “recognise the Jews as their real enemies”, consider that “radio and TV journalists are Jewish”, and affirm that “their elimination should be a top priority”. The article ends with a weblink leading to a list of 34 journalists and human rights defenders working on minority issues, racism and fascism. Among them are Mr. Aliaksandr Verkhovski, Chairman of the SOVA Centre, and Ms. Valentina Uzunova, a lawyer, member of the NGO “For a Russia Without Racism” and expert on racial issues and hate crimes. For most of the individuals appearing on the list, personal information such as home address, telephone number, and pictures are displayed. On several occasions, some members of the forum have posted additional information. Another link leads to a list of members of the military college of the Supreme Court, who sentenced Captain Eduard Ulman, member of the Russian military intelligence, on June 14, 2007 for the killing of six Chechens in January 2002. Here again, personal information is given, including pictures of the buildings in which they live as well as tips on the easiest way to enter their homes. On April 21, 2007, the General Prokuratura declared that the complaint lodged by the SOVA Centre against the authors of the article was admissible. On April 24, 2008, the Head ad interim of the Department in charge of relations with the media of the Prokuratura stated that “the Prokuratura [had] launched an enquiry into the list of the enemies of the Russian people, which includes names of judges”. The Observatory reiterates its deepest concern about the ongoing harassment of human rights defenders by non-state actors such as extremist movements, and recalls that according to Article 12.2 of the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration” The Observatory further recalls that the Russian Federation was elected to the Human Rights Council in June 2006 for three years and is committed, in this regard, to “uphold the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights”. In addition, as a participating State of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the Russian Federation acknowledges that “the [1998] UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders [... places] a responsibility [...] on states to adopt and implement adequate legislation and administrative procedures that would provide for a conducive environment for human rights defenders to promote and strive for the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, and recognises “the need for particular attention, support and protection for human rights defenders by the OSCE, its Institutions and field operations, as well as by participating States”[1]. Actions requested: The Observatory urges the authorities of the Russian Federation to:   Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Aliaksandr Verkhovski, of Ms. Valentina Uzunova, as well as of human rights defenders appearing on the weblist and more generally of all human rights defenders in the Russian Federation;  Identify all those responsible, bring them before a civil competent and impartial tribunal and apply to them sanctions provided by the law;  Put an end to all acts of harassment, including at the judicial level, against all human rights defenders in the Russian Federation, and ensure in all circumstances that they be able to carry out their work without unjustified hindrances;  Comply with all the provisions of the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, in particular with Article 1, which provides that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, as well as with the above-mentioned Article 12.2;  Comply with the provisions of the Document of the Copenhagen Meeting of the 2nd Conference on the Human Dimension of the Cooperation and Security Conference in Europe (CSCE) (1990), and uphold in all circumstances the principles and provisions enshrined in the international and regional human rights instruments ratified by the Russian Federation and which, in particular, guarantee freedoms of association, demonstration, expression and opinion, in particular the European Convention on Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights;  More generally, ensure in all circumstances the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with international and regional human rights instruments ratified by the Russian Federation.
