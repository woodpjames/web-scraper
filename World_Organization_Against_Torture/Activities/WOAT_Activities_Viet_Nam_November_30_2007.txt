New information: The Observatory has been informed by the Vietnam Committee on Human Rights about the reduction of the sentence of Mr. Nguyen Van Dai, a lawyer, a pro-democracy activist and founder of the Vietnam Committee on Human Rights. According to the information received, on November 28, 2007, the Hanoi Appeals Court decided to reduce Mr. Nguyen Van Dai’s sentencing to four years’ imprisonment, followed by four years’ house arrest, for “conducting propaganda against the Socialist Republic of Vietnam” (Article 88 of the Criminal Code). He had been sentenced to five years’ imprisonment and four years’ house arrest on May 11, 2007 on the same grounds. The Observatory expresses its deep concern at Mr. Nguyen Van Dai’s sentencing and arbitrary detention, which seem to directly aim at sanctioning his activities in favour of human rights and are in flagrant violation of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted on December 9, 1998 by the United Nations General Assembly, which states in its article 12.2 that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”. Background information: On March 6, 2007, security forces raided the residence of Mr. Nguyen Van Dai, in Hanoi, and placed him under arrest. He was charged with “conducting propaganda against the Socialist Republic of Vietnam” (Article 88 of the Criminal Code), although in July 2002 the United Nations Human Rights Committee denounced the provisions of Article 88 as “incompatible” with international human rights law and demanded their immediate repeal. Since Mr. Nguyen Van Dai founded the Committee for Human Rights in Vietnam in November 2006, he has been summoned repeatedly for police interrogations because of his statements in favour of human rights and democracy. Besides, during the meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), which took place in Hanoi from November 17 to 19, 2006, 10 security police officers surrounded his home and prohibited all visitors (See Observatory Press Release, dated November 20, 2006). On February 28, 2007, following pressure from Security Police, the Business Registration Office of Hanoi’s Planning and Investment Bureau issued a “Decision” to withdraw the licence of the Translation and Legal Consultation Firm (TNHH) in Hanoi of which Mr. Nguyen Van Dai is a co-founder and the Executive Director. On May 11, 2007, the People’s Court of Hanoi sentenced him to five years’ imprisonment and four years’ house arrest for “conducting propaganda against the Socialist Republic of Vietnam”. Since Mr. Nguyen Van Dai founded an organisation called the Committee for Human Rights in Vietnam in November 2006, he has been summoned repeatedly for police interrogations because of his statements in favour of human rights and democracy. Besides, during the meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), which took place in Hanoi from November 17 to 19, 2006, 10 security police officers surrounded his home and prohibited all visitors (See Observatory Annual Report 2006).
