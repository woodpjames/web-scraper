URGENT APPEAL - THE OBSERVATORY

Release / Ongoing arbitrary detention
Uzbekistan
October 20, 2011
 
The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint 
programme of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World 
Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) has received new information and requests 
your urgent intervention in the following situation in Uzbekistan.
 
New information :
 
The Observatory has been informed of the release of Mr. 
Norboy Kholjigitov, Former President and member of the Ishtikhan district branch of the 
Human Rights Society of Uzbekistan (HRSU) in the Samarkand region.
 
According to the information received, on October 14, 2011, Mr. Norboy Kholjigitov was released on parole and 
returned home in the evening.
 
The Observatory welcomes the release of Mr. Norboy Kholjigitov and thanks all the persons, institutions and 
organisations who intervened in his favour and recalls that human rights 
defenders in Uzbekistan continue to operate in a climate of fear. 

 
However, the Observatory deplores that Mr. Kholjigitov's health has 
seriously deteriorated in detention after six years and four months in a colony 
and needs urgent medical care.
 
The Observatory also deplores the continued arbitrary detention of 
eight other members of HRSU, namely Messrs. Nasim Isakov, Jamshid 
Karimov, Zafar Rahimov, Yuldash Rasulov, Azamjon 
Formonov, Khabibilla Okpulatov, Alisher Karamatov and 
Gaybullo Jalilov, who remain today arbitrarily detained, notably despite 
the serious deterioration of their health and calls for their immediate and 
unconditional release. 
 
The Observatory expresses its deep concern about their arbitrary 
detention, which seems to merely sanction their human rights activities in 
flagrant violation of the provisions of the United Nations (UN) Declaration on 
Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 
December 9, 1998.
 
Background information :
 
The Observatory recalls that Mr. Kholjigitov had been arrested on 
June 4, 2005 and sentenced on October 18, 2005 to ten years’ imprisonment on 
charges of “extortion” (Article 165 of the Criminal Code), “slander” (Article 
139), “fraud” (Article 168), “infringement to the life of the President” 
(Article 158) and “infringement to the constitutional regime of the State” 
(Article 159) by the Kattakourgane Criminal Court, District of Samarkand. 
Mr. Kholjigitov suffered of bad conditions of detention. The cells 
were not heated and 80 inmates were detained per cell. Mr. Kholjigitov lost a 
lot of weight and was diagnosed with diabetes. He did not receive adequate 
treatment in prison. 

 
In addition, twenty days following the submission in November 2008 of 
a complaint to the Supreme Court of Uzbekistan under the reference 
X.4175, Mr. Kholjigitov was tortured in detention. He was further threatened 
that he would be sent to a psychiatric ward, if he continued with his 
complaint.
 
In 2010, Mr. Norboy Kholjigitov was interrogated about a letter he 
sent to the President on May 5, 2010 asking to be transferred to a prison clinic 
for medical treatment, and subsequently accused of violating eight internal 
rules of the prison[1]. On August 11, 2010, his wife who was visiting him in the prison was 
interrogated by the security services (SNB) about the letter her husband had 
sent to the President, and threatened. She was then requested to leave the 
prison after the first day of her two-day visit. 
 
During a visit of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) 
representatives conducted from January 24 to 28, 2011 to prison colony U/Ya 
64/61, Mr. Kholjigitov was placed in a solitary confinement cell of the Kasan 
local police precinct of Kashkadarya region, where he was kept until January 28, 
before being brought back to the U/Ya 64/61 colony. At the same period, the 
colony’s chief medical practitioner had prescribed him to be placed in a medical 
facility, but the head of the colony administration refused.
