The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights
Defenders, a partnership of FIDH and the World Organisation Against Torture
(OMCT), requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in Bahrain.
 
Description of the situation:
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about a wave of
summons and travel bans targeting at least 18 human rights defenders, including
members of the Bahrain Center for Human Rights (BCHR), the Bahrain Human Rights
Observatory (BHRO), the Bahrain Human Rights Society (BHRS), the
European-Bahraini Organisation for Human Rights (EBOHR) and Salam for Democracy
and Human Rights (Salam), as well as four political activists.
 
According to
the information received, between April 20, 2017 and April 26, 2017, 22 human
rights activists, including four BCHR members, Mr. Enas Oun, Mr. Ahmed Al
Saffar, Mr. Hussain Radhi and
Ms. Nedal Al Salman, as well as BHRO
member Ms. Jalila Al Salman, along
with BHRS member Ms. Zainab Al Khamees,
EBOHR member Ms. Fatima Al Halwachi, Salam member Ms. Ebtisam Al Sayegh, human rights lawyer Mr. Mohamed Al Tajer, journalists Ms. Faisal Hayat and Mr. Ahmed Radhi, Ms. Zainad Mohamed, Ms. Riyhanna
Mosawi, Mr. Talal Salawi, Mr. Monther Al Khoor, Mr. Sayed Hadi Al Moosawi, doctors Mr. Taha Al Derazi and Ms. Rulla Al Saffar[1]
and four members of the political society Waad, were all summoned to appear
before the Public Prosecutor for interrogation.
 
The 22
individuals are all accused of supposedly participating in “illegal gatherings”
in the city of Deraz[2]
on January 6 and 14, 2017. Yet none of the 22 ever participated in such alleged
gatherings. Travel bans have been issued against the 22 individuals.
 
The Observatory
fears that the travel bans were preventively issued against the 22 individuals to
prevent them from attending Bahrain’s Universal Periodic Review to be held in
Geneva from May 1 to May 5, 2017 before the United Nations Human Rights Council.
 
The Observatory
expresses its outmost concerns over these new acts of harassment against human
rights defenders in Bahrain, which only aim at sanctioning their legitimate
human rights activities.
 
The Observatory urges the authorities to
immediately and unconditionally lift the travel bans against the aforementioned
individuals and to put an end to all acts of harassment, including at the
judicial level, against them and all human rights defenders in the country.
 
Actions requested:
 
Please write to the authorities in Bahrain, urging
them to:
 
i. Guarantee in all circumstances the freedom of
movement of human rights defenders, by immediately and unconditionally lifting
the travel ban imposed against the above-mentioned individuals, as it aims only
at sanctioning their legitimate human rights activities;
 
ii. Put an end to all forms of harassment against
all human rights organisations and defenders in Bahrain, in particular the aforementioned
individuals, so that they are able to
carry out their work without hindrance;
 
iii. Comply with all the provisions of the United
Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, in particular with its Articles
1, 5(b), and 12.2;
 
iv. Ensure in all circumstances respect for human
rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights
standards and international instruments ratified by Bahrain.
