Arbitrary detention

The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a partnership of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and FIDH, has received new information and requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in Cambodia.
 
New information:
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the continued arbitrary detention of Messrs. Ny Sokha, Yi Soksan, Nay Vanda, and Ms. Lim Mony, all staff members of the Cambodian Human Rights and Development Association (ADHOC), as well as of Mr. Ny Chakrya, former Head of ADHOC Human Rights and Monitoring Section and now Deputy Secretary-General of the National Election Committee (NEC).
 
According to the information received, on March 13, 2017, the Supreme Court upheld the November 28, 2016 decision of the Court of Appeal to extend the pre-trial detention of the four ADHOC staff members for a further six months (See background information).
 
On February 27, 2017, Messrs. Ny Sokha, Yi Soksan, Nay Vanda, Ny Chakrya, and Ms. Lim Mony were summoned before the Supreme Court, following the appeal they filed against the decision to extend their detention order. However, due to the bailiff's failure to send the summons for their transportation to court to the three prison facilities where the five are detained, none of them were brought to the Supreme Court for their hearing. As a result, the hearing was postponed. Moreover, the Supreme Court decided to sever the appeals of the five defenders. The hearing of the four ADHOC staff members was postponed to March 6, 2017, while the hearing of Ny Chakrya is now scheduled for March 24, 2017, at 8am. On March 6, the Supreme Court announced it would deliver its verdict on March 13 in the hearing of the four ADHOC staff members.
 
As of March 14, 2017, the five human rights defenders have spent 320 days in pre-trial detention.
 
The Observatory strongly condemns the ongoing arbitrary detention of Messrs. Ny Chakrya, Ny Sokha, Yi Soksan, Nay Vanda, and Ms. Lim Mony, which only aims at sanctioning their legitimate human rights activities, and calls upon the Cambodian authorities to immediately and unconditionally release the five human rights defenders, in accordance with the Opinion adopted by the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (WGAD)[1].
 
The Observatory also calls upon the Cambodian authorities to put an end to any act of harassment against all human rights defenders in Cambodia.

Background information:
 
On April 27 and 28, 2016, Messrs. Ny Sokha, Nay Vanda, Yi Soksan, Try Chhuon, and Ms. Lim Mony - as well as Mr. Ny Chakrya were brought in for questioning by the Anti-Corruption Unit (ACU). Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) official Mr. Soen Sally, who was also summoned, did not appear before the ACU due to his immunity as a UN staff member.
 
On May 2, 2016, following five to six days of questioning by the ACU and then by the prosecutor, Messrs. Ny Sokha, Nay Vanda, Yi Soksan, and Ms. Lim Mony were charged with “bribery of a witness” under Article 548 of the Criminal Code and detained. In addition, Messrs. Ny Chakrya and Soen Sally were charged as “accomplices to bribery of a witness” (Articles 29 and 548 of the Criminal Code). Mr. Ny Chakrya was also detained.
 
The charges were related to a complaint signed by Ms. Khom Chandaraty (also known as Ms. Srey Mom), which was lodged following her questioning in March 2016 by anti-terrorism police and a prosecutor about an alleged affair with deputy opposition leader Mr. Khem Sokha, after ADHOC responded to Ms. Srey Mom’s request for legal and material assistance - a US$204 allowance to cover food and transport costs. This legitimate support, aimed at covering the basic expenses of a client, was construed by the ACU as bribery and corruption.
 
On June 13, 2016, the Court of Appeal in Phnom Penh denied bail to Messrs. Ny Chakrya, Ny Sokha, Nay Vanda, Yi Soksan, and Ms. Lim Mony. The defendants appealed the decision.
 
On September 22, 2016, the Phnom Penh Municipal Court sentenced Mr. Ny Chakrya to six months in prison and a six million Riel (about 1,414 Euros) fine in relation to another criminal case[2]. Mr. Ny Chakrya filed an appeal against his conviction. On December 14, 2016, the Court of Appeal upheld Mr. Ny Chakrya’s conviction.
 
On September 28, 2016, the Phnom Penh Municipal Court denied bail to Messrs. Ny Chakrya, Ny Sokha, Yi Soksan, Nay Vanda, and Ms. Lim Mony.
 
On October 27, 2016, as the period of pre-trial detention of Messrs. Ny Chakrya, Ny Sokha, Yi Soksan, Nay Vanda, and Ms. Lim Mony was about to expire, the Phnom Penh Municipal Court extended the detention of the five for up to another six months under the pretext that the defendants needed to remain available for any further interrogation and court procedures.
 
On November 28, 2016, the Court of Appeal upheld the extension of the pre-trial detention for another six months and refused to close the investigation. The Court argued that the issues of the extension of the detention and the continuation of the investigation were up to the discretion of the Investigating Judge of the Phnom Penh Municipal Court. The Observatory considers that this decision infringes upon Article 208 of the Criminal Procedure Code because there is no “clear and well-motivated warrant” to extend the detention, as stipulated in the article[3]. According to Cambodian criminal procedural law, the five defenders may spend 18 months in pre-trial detention.
 
On November 30, 2016, the Supreme Court upheld a previous decision adopted by the Court of Appeal on June 13, 2016 to refuse to release Messrs. Ny Chakrya, Ny Sokha, Yi Soksan, Nay Vanda, and Ms. Lim Mony on bail. The Court based its decision on Article 205 of the Criminal Procedure Code[4], therefore, upholding the continued applicability of both detention grounds, i.e. to maintain public order and prevent collusion with accomplices, victims, and witnesses. The Supreme Court’s verdict was preceded by two other Court of Appeals rulings. On November 11, 2016, the five defenders were denied bail for the second time by the Court of Appeal.
 
Messrs. Ny Sokha, Nay Vanda, and Yi Soksan remain in detention in Prey Sar’s Correctional Centre 1 (‘CC1’), while Ms. Lim Mony is detained in Prey Sar’s Correctional Centre 2 (‘CC2’). Mr. Ny Chakrya is detained in Police Judiciaire (PJ) prison. All three jails are located in Phnom Penh. All of the detainees are being held alongside convicted criminals, contrary to Article 10(2)(a) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which Cambodia is a State party, and Article 26 of Cambodia’s Law on Prisons.
