Brief description of the situation  The Observatory has been informed by the José Alvéar Restrepo Lawyers' Association, a member organization of the OMCT and the FIDH, of new death threats uttered against Sr. Alirio Uribe Muñoz, a lawyer defending human rights, a member of the Lawyers' Association and vice-president of the FIDH. The Lawyers' Association is aware of the recent publication of a pamphlet, which warned of a coming paramilitary offensive in the capital, Bogotà, and in which the name of the lawyer, Uribe Muñoz, was mentioned.   Previously Uribe Muñoz had been the target of grave harassment and threats. This situation became aggravated towards the end of 1999 with repeated visits and telephone calls at his place of residence, or his office  or the residence of his family in Bucaramanga, on the part of unknown persons asking for information about him. On one such occasion the family was told that he was being sought in order to "give him a present" and fictitious telephone numbers and addresses were left. On several occasions unknown individuals followed him on motorbikes without number plates. Moreover various threatening pamphlets appeared in the classes where he taught, mentioning various professors and the Lawyers' Association. In addition, towards the end of 1999, a document appeared in the offices of the CUT (Central Unitaria de Trabajadores) which threatened various persons, including Uribe Muñoz. The Observatory also recalls that in August 1999 the name of Alirio Uribe Muñoz appeared in a list of persons threatened with death , the list being made public  by a group calling itself  the “Colombian Rebel Army” (See COL 009/9908/OBS 054).   The Observatory stresses its grave concern at the persistent harassment and attacks against human rights defenders in Colombia.  Action requested  Please write to the Colombian authorities urging them to:  i.	guarantee in all circumstances the safety of lawyer Alirio Uribe Munoz and of his family, and their physical and psychological integrity;  ii.	carry out a thorough and effective investigation into the facts mentioned above in order to establish who is responsible, including the alleged participation through action or failure to act of the military, police or other  authorities , and bring such persons to justice imposing upon them the penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions provided by law;  iii.	ensure the application of the provisions of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders adopted by the General Assembly of the UN on December 9th 1998, especially with respect to the protection of the right of all persons, "...individually or in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realization of human and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels"  (Art.1.) as well as the duty of the  State  to ensure “the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure, adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration" (Art.12.2);	  iv.	guarantee effectively the exercise of legitimate activity  in the defence of human rights in accordance with the Presidential Directive of September 9th 1999.  v.	act in accordance with the provisions of the Universal  Declaration of Human Rights and the International  Pacts and Conventions ratified by Colombia.
