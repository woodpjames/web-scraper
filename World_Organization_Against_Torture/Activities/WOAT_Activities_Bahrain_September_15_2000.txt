Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned by information received regarding the detention without charge or trial of five Shi’a clerics and opposition figures, since January 1996.  According to the information received from the Bahrain Human Rights Organisation (BHRO), a member of the OMCT network, Abdul-Wahab Hussein, Hassan Sultan, Hussein al-Daihi, Hassan Mishma'a, and Sayyid Ibrahim Adnan al-Alawi are being subjected to ill treatment and mounting pressure to sign a letter admitting misconduct and undertaking not to take part in any political activity if they were to be released.  `Abd al-Wahab Hussein, Hassan Sultan, Hussein al-Daihi, Hassan Mishma'a, and Sayyid Ibrahim Adnan al-Alawi, were among several prominent figures arrested in January 1996 in connection with the 1994 petition to the Amir calling, among other things, for the restoration of the Constitution and the National Assembly. Abdul-Wahab Hussain, one of the original 14 signers of the 1994 petition to the Amir and member of the Committee of the Popular Petition (CPP), was released on 17th March 2000 following an order from the High Court of Appeal, but he was rearrested after spending an hour at home.  Among other figures associated with the group and who were arrested at the same time in February 1996; Shaikh 'Ali Mirza Al-Nakkas, a blind cliric aged 50, who died in incommunicado detention in June 1997, Shaikh Abdul Amir Al-Jamri, Shaikh `Ali Bin Ahmad al-Jedhafsi and Sheikh Ali Ashoor who were released but under severe or degrading conditions and compelled to give up there basic rights.  Sheikh Ali Ashoor had been released recently, but he was compelled to sign an undertaking not to take part in any political activity. In particular, not to ask for restoration of the Constitution, and not to pray in certain areas.  On July 26, 1999 Shaikh `Ali Bin Ahmad al-Jedhafsi was released after spending more than three years in detention without charge or trial. But he was arrested and harassed many times by security forces to prevent him from social and religious activities.   There are grave concerns for the systematic use of arbitrary detention in Bahrain.  As such OMCT calls for the immediate unconditional release of the above-mentioned persons and calls for the abolition of the 1974 State Security Law which allows for the detention of a person without charge or trial for up to three years and sets a special court system "the State Security Court", a procedure of which falls short of International standards for fair trial.  Action requested  Please write to the authorities in Bahrain urging them to:  i.	take all necessary measures to guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of the above-mentioned persons and order their immediate unconditional release; ii.	put an immediate end to the use of arbitrary detention and abrogate 1974 State Security Law and all national laws which are not in compliance with international human rights standards; iii.	guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
