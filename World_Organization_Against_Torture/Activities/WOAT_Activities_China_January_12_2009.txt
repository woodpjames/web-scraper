Description of the situation: The Observatory has been informed by Chinese Human Rights Defenders (CHRD) about the arbitrary arrest of Mr. Wang Debang, a Beijing-based human rights activist, for his suspected involvement in drafting a human rights report. According to the information received, on January 10, 2009, at 11 pm, more than 20 policemen led by the head of the National Security Police of Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau (PSB) arrived at Mr. Wang Debang’s home. Mr. Wang was then taken to a PSB office and interrogated for six hours before being released.  The police questioned Mr. Wang about his alleged involvement in drafting A Report on the Situation of Human Rights Defenders in China (2008), an upcoming report by CHRD. The police also asked Mr. Wang questions about his involvement in “Charter 08”, launched on December 9, 2008 on the Internet and calling for political reforms that promote human rights and democracy[1]. The police also searched Mr. Wang’s home in the presence of his wife and young daughters and confiscated his computer and other personal items. The Observatory expresses its deep concern with the arbitrary arrest and harassment of Mr. Wang Debang, which seems to merely sanction his human rights activities and as such is a flagrant violation of the provisions of the United Nations (UN) Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998. Besides, the arrest of Mr. Debang is one more evidence of the ongoing determination of the Chinese authorities to strike down any dissenting voice in the PRC, in a moment where there seems to be a further structuring of the human rights movement around the Charter 08 in particular. The Observatory further points out that in April 2006 the PRC submitted a document to the UN in order to support its candidacy to the Human Rights Council’s first election, in which it affirmed that amendment had been made to the Constitution to aim at “defining the position of human rights in the overall national development strategy”, and that as a member of the Human Rights Council, the PRC “shall uphold the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights”. Actions required: Please write to the Chinese authorities urging them to:   Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Wang Debang;  Put an end to all acts of harassment, including at the judicial level, against him as well as all other human rights defenders in China;  Conform with Article 33.3 of the Chinese Constitution that states that “the State respects and safeguards human rights”;  Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, especially its article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, article 6(b), which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others (...) to publish, impart or disseminate to others views, information and knowledge on all human rights and fundamental freedoms”, and its article 8(2), which provides that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to submit to governmental bodies and agencies and organisations concerned with public affairs criticism and proposals for improving their functioning and to draw attention to any aspect of their work that may hinder or impede the promotion, protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms”;  Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by the People’s Republic of China.
