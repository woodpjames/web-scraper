RE: Request to Create a
Commission of Inquiry into the killing of Kem Ley
 
Dear Samdech Kralahom Sar
Kheng,
 
Ahead of the one-year
anniversary of the killing of Kem Ley,
we, the undersigned, reiterate our concerns regarding the apparent lack of
progress in investigating this case, as well as the inadequate investigation
and trial of Oeuth Ang, the only person yet convicted or charged in relation to
Kem Ley’s death.[1] In light of the
inadequacy of the investigation, we urge the Royal Government of Cambodia (“RGC”)
to establish an independent and impartial Commission of Inquiry, in line with
international standards, to continue the investigation.
 
On 23 March 2017,
immediately following the conviction of Oeuth Ang for the killing of Kem Ley,
Oeuth Ang’s lawyer announced that an investigation was ongoing into two persons
allegedly linked to the killing – a fact confirmed by the prosecutor Ly
Sophana, who reportedly said that the case was split so that Oeuth Ang could be
tried while the investigation into the other suspects continued.[2]  Oeuth Ang’s lawyer reportedly suggested these
persons are ‘Pou Lis’, who, according to Oeuth Ang’s testimony, introduced
Oeuth Ang to Kem Ley, and a second man named ‘Chork’, who Oeuth Ang claimed had
sold a handgun to him.[3] Moreover,
broader questions about the motive for the killing remain unanswered. Despite
this, neither the investigating judge nor the RGC have since publicly reported
any progress regarding the supposed investigation or its subjects.[4] 
 
The
right to life is enshrined in the Cambodian Constitution and binding
international human rights law, particularly the International Covenant on
Civil and Political Rights, to which Cambodia is a State Party. The duty of
states to protect that right to life includes a positive obligation on the RGC
to ensure an impartial and thorough investigation into the killing of Kem Ley.[5] The
United Nations Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of
Extralegal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions (“UN Principles”) clarify how this
obligation is to be discharged and explicitly emphasize that states must launch
a ‘thorough, prompt and impartial investigation of all suspected cases of
extra-legal, arbitrary and summary executions.’[6]
Furthermore, the UN’s Minnesota Protocol on the Investigation of Potentially
Unlawful Death (2016) (“the Minnesota Protocol”) sets out the requirement of
‘government verification of the facts and public disclosure of the truth’ where
there has been a violation to the right to life, as well as providing that
‘investigative processes and outcomes must be transparent, including through
openness to the scrutiny of the general public and of victims’ families.’[7] The
failure of the authorities to publicize information related to the allegedly
ongoing investigation in Kem Ley’s case is non-compliant with these standards
and gives the strong impression that little progress has been made in the
investigation, if such an investigation is occurring at all. 
 
We, the
undersigned, also reiterate our concerns regarding the flawed trial of Oeuth
Ang. The trial of Oeuth Ang was met with substantial criticism from
international observers, who stated that the trial revealed the investigation
to be seemingly deficient in several important respects.[8] The
alleged motive for the murder, an unpaid debt of $3,000, was rejected by both
the widow of Kem Ley, Bou Rachana, and the wife of Oeuth Ang, Hoeum Hout.[9] The
credibility of this motive went unchallenged by the prosecution at trial and
was not referenced in the trial judgement, while the possibility of further
accomplices was not adequately addressed. The role of other actors identifiable
in video evidence submitted to the court was apparently not subjected to
scrutiny at either investigation or trial.[10] Moreover,
following the charging of Oeuth Ang, reports emerged stating that senior
district and military officials had a meeting with Oeuth Ang only a week before
the killing of Kem Ley.[11]  Representatives of the RGC have themselves
cast doubt upon both Oeuth Ang’s motive[12] and
testimony claiming he was acting alone.[13] These
statements and reports, combined with the failure of the prosecution to pursue
these lines of questioning at trial, suggests that the investigation and trial
may have failed to meet the standards relating to the right to fair trial under
domestic and international human rights law.
 
The RGC must now
establish a Commission of Inquiry in order to conduct an independent,
impartial, effective and transparent investigation into the killing. Principle
11 of the UN Principles calls for the establishment of a Commission of Inquiry
when ‘the established investigative procedures are inadequate because of lack
of expertise or impartiality, because of the importance of the matter or
because of the apparent existence of a pattern of abuse, and in cases where
there are complaints from the family of the victim about these inadequacies.’[14]
The rejection of alleged motives by relatives of both Kem Ley and Oeuth Ang are
likely to satisfy the requirement of ‘complaints from the family of the victim’
under the UN Principles.[15]
For a Commission of Inquiry to be credible and to satisfy the requirements
outlined under the UN Principles, ‘[m]embers of such a commission shall be
chosen for their recognized impartiality, competence and independence as
individuals. In particular, they shall be independent of any institution,
agency or person that may be the subject of the inquiry’.[16]

 
Given
the fact that the killing occurred against a backdrop of escalating attacks on human
rights defenders and the political opposition, and
in the context of a well-documented history of
killings of human rights defenders with impunity in Cambodia, it is imperative
that the Commission of Inquiry be staffed by individuals, including legal
experts and United Nations human rights officials, with no ties to the RGC.
 
Following
the killing of Kem Ley, five UN human rights experts made similar calls for
investigation, stating, “We call for a prompt, thorough and impartial
investigation into the crime […] conducted by an independent body with no ties
to the government.”[17] The
deeply flawed nature of the investigation into the death of Kem Ley has not met
international standards or Cambodia’s obligations under binding domestic and
international law, and now necessitates the establishment of an independent
Commission of Inquiry in order to facilitate justice for the family of the
victim.
 
We, the
undersigned, reiterate our concerns regarding the flawed investigation into the
killing of Kem Ley and lack of progress in the subsequent investigations into
the suspected accomplices to the killing, as well as our demand that the
investigation now be taken over by an independent and impartial Commission of
Inquiry.
 
Yours
sincerely,
