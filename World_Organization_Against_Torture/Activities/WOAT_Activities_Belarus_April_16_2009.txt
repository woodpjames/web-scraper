New information: The Observatory has been informed by sources about the initiation of criminal proceedings against Mr. Leanid Svetsik, one of the founders of the human rights association “Nasha Viasna” and a member of the Vitsebsk branch of the human rights centre Viasna. According to the information received, on March 31, 2009, Mr. Leanid Svetsik was charged with “fomentation of racial, national or religious enmity” (Article 130 of the Criminal Code) and “defamation of the President” (Part 2 of Article 367 of the Criminal Code). The Observatory denounces these blatantly unfair charges and considers them as a pretext to silence Mr. Svetsik’s human rights activities. Indeed, the Observatory fears that these acts of judicial harassment might be directly related to the support given by Mr. Svetsik to victims of threats by the Russian neo-nazi organisation Russian National Unity (RNU). Since 2006, Mr. Leanid Svetsik has indeed helped those who had received RNU threats in applying to the appropriate State organs for protection of their rights (See background information). He is also providing legal aid for victims of human rights violations and has taken part in the preparation of five complaints concerning violations of citizens’ rights by the Belarusian authorities. The Observatory expresses its deepest concern about these acts of judicial harassment against Mr. Leanid Svetsik as they seem to merely aim at sanctioning his human rights activities, and recalls that as a Participating State of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), Belarus must conform with paragraph 8 of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly Resolution on Strengthening OSCE Engagement with Human Rights Defenders and National Human Rights Institutions[1], which states that the OSCE Participating States recognise “the need for particular attention, support and protection for human rights defenders by the OSCE, its Institutions and field operations, as well as by participating States”. The Observatory urges the European Commission Delegation as well as European Union (EU) Member-States embassies in Belarus to call upon the Belarusian authorities to drop all charges against Mr. Svetsik, in line with the EU Guidelines on Human Rights Defenders. Background information: On May 20, 2008, a complaint on above-mentioned RNU threats was brought before the Vitsebsk oblast KGB department. Three days later, on May 23, 2008, three KGB officers burst into the apartment of Mr. Svetsik and showed him a ruling of the Prosecutor’s office initiating criminal proceedings for “fomentation of national and religious enmity”. The ruling described Mr. Svetsik as a witness in a case of threats against Belarusian citizens from the RNU. The KGB officers also brought with them several persons to witness the search, which was directed by the Senior Lieutenant of the KGB and lasted from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. During the search the KGB confiscated his computer and other office supplies, as well as printed human rights editions including the calendars which were dedicated to the 60th anniversary of the creation of the United Nations. On that day, Mr. Svetsik was then brought to Vitsebsk oblast KGB office and was interrogated for more than two hours by an officer. The interrogation was videotaped. He was then handed out the writ for the next interrogation, which was set on May 28, 2008. Mr. Svetsik went back to the KGB office on May 30, as he had to wait for his lawyer from Minsk. On that day, he and his lawyer signed a paper rejecting the accusations of the Public Prosecutor. On September 18, 2008, the case against Mr. Svetsik was suspended. Judicial proceedings were reopened on March 31, 2009 and Mr. Svetsik is now facing new charges. The police would have failed to explain the grounds for the resumption of proceedings. On February 26, 2009, the Belarusian authorities refused to register the human rights organisation Nasha Viasna.
