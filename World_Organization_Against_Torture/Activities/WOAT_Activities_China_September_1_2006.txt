Brief description of the situation:The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed about the sentencing of Mr. Ching Cheong, a Hong Kong-based correspondent with Singapore’s Straits Times newspaper, to five years of prison.  According to the information received, on August 31, 2006, Mr. Ching Cheong, a 56 year-old permanent resident of Hong Kong and Singapore, and a British passport holder, was sentenced to five years of prison for “spying” by the Beijing Intermediate People’s Court No. 2. The Court also ordered the seizure of 300,000 Yuan (29,000 euros) of his assets.   Mr. Ching had worked for Wen Wei Po, a pro-Beijing newspaper in Hong Kong, before resigning in protest after the Tiananmen Square massacre in June 1989. On April 22, 2005, while working as a chief China correspondent for Singapore’s Straits Time, Mr. Ching was arrested in a Guangzhou hotel in Southern China, where he had allegedly gone to collect a manuscript relating to late Chinese Party Secretary Zhao Ziyang.   On August 5, 2005, Mr. Ching was formally charged by authorities for buying “top secret” information and passing it on to Taiwanese intelligence services from 2000 to March 2005.   His trial, which opened on August 15, 2006, was held behind closed doors and lasted just a few hours. In addition, the defence counsel’s access to evidence was hampered. His family said that it will appeal the conviction.  The International Secretariat of OMCT expresses its deep concern about this sentencing, and calls upon the Chinese authorities to release Mr. Ching Cheong immediately, as his detention is arbitrary.  Furthermore, the International Secretariat of OMCT urges the Chinese authorities to conform with its international human rights obligations, commitments that were reaffirmed by China on the occasion of its election as a member of the new United Nations Human Rights Council.  Action requested:Please write to the authorities in the People’s Republic of China urging them to: i.	Guarantee, in all circumstances, the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Ching Cheong;  ii.	Ensure that Mr. Ching Cheong be immediately released, as his detention is arbitrarym and that his procedural rights will be respected at all times;  iii.	Guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
