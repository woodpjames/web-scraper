URGENT APPEAL - THE OBSERVATORY

Arbitrary detention /
Judicial harassment
Turkey
April 20, 2017
 
The Observatory for the Protection of Human
Rights Defenders, a partnership of FIDH and the World Organisation Against
Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in
Turkey.
 
Description of the situation:
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable
sources about the arbitrary detention and judicial harassment of Ms. Ayşe
Dicle, Co-Chair of the Mesopotamia
Association of Assistance and Solidarity for Families with Lost Relatives
(MEYA-DER), which was shut down under the state of emergency regulations[1].
 
According to the
information received, on March 9, 2017, as she was visiting one of her
relatives at the maternity hospital in Diyarbakır, Ms. Ayşe Dicle was arrested
by police officers and taken to Diyarbakır Provincial Security Directorate
Anti-Terror Bureau.
 
She was detained there
for six days before the Criminal Judge of Peace in Diyarbakır ordered her
detention on charges of “being a member of a terrorist organisation” under
Article 314 of the Turkish Penal Code. She is being held at Diyarbakır Prison
since March 15, 2017, under poor conditions including overcrowded cells and
lack of access to sanitary facilities and medical services.
 
The accusations pending against Ms. Ayşe Dicle are connected to an
investigation opened in 2014 by the Diyarbakır Prosecutor into the “city
assemblies”[2]
which claims that the Kayapınar City Assembly is an assembly of the Kurdistan
Communities Union (KCK). 
 
The Observatory strongly condemns the arbitrary
arrest of Ms. Ayşe Dicle, which
appears to only aim at sanctioning her peaceful and legitimate human rights
activities.
 
Accordingly, the Observatory calls upon the Turkish judicial
authorities to immediately and unconditionally release Ms. Ayşe Dicle, and end all forms of
harassment against her.
 
Actions requested:
 
Please write to the authorities in Turkey,
urging them to:
 
i. Release Ms. Ayşe Dicle immediately and unconditionally, as her detention
is arbitrary since it only aims at sanctioning her legitimate human rights
activities;
 
ii. Guarantee Ms. Ayşe Dicle’s right to due process and a fair trial, including
access to her lawyer and to information about the judicial procedure against
her;
 
iii. Guarantee in all circumstances the physical
and psychological integrity of Ms. Ayşe
Dicle as well as of all human rights defenders in Turkey;
 
iv. Put an end to all forms of
harassment, including at judicial level, against Ms. Ayşe Dicle, as well as all human rights defenders in Turkey;
 
v. Comply with all the provisions of the United
Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 9,
1998, in particular its Articles 1, 5 and 12.2;
 
vi. Ensure in all circumstances respect for
human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human
rights standards and international instruments ratified by Turkey.
