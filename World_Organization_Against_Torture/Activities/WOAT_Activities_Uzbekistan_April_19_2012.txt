Early conditional release
Uzbekistan
April 19, 2012
The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), has received new information on the following situation in Uzbekistan.
New information:
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources of the early conditional release of Mr. 
Alisher Karamatov, Head of the Mirzaabad regional branch of Human Rights Society of 
Uzbekistan (HRSU), particularly active in the defence of economical and social 
rights.
According to the information received, on April 12, 2012, Mr. 
Karamatov benefited from an early conditional release after serving six years of his nine-year prison 
sentence.
The Observatory welcomes the conditional release of Mr. Karamatov and thanks all the persons, institutions and organisations who 
intervened in his favour. However, the Observatory denounces the ongoing 
harassment of a large number of human rights defenders who currently remain 
arbitrarily detained, in an attempt to sanction their human rights 
activities.
Moreover, the Observatory urges the Uzbek authorities to carry out a 
prompt, impartial and transparent investigation into the acts of torture 
suffered by Mr. Karamatov while in detention, in order to identify all those 
responsible and to sanction them according to law. 
Background information:
Mr. Alisher Karamatov was arrested on April 29, 2006, after he had 
refused to stop his human rights activities. He was sentenced on June 15, 2006, 
to nine years in prison after being tortured and confessing “fabricated 
extortion” charges, after the public minister had accused him of having extorted 
money from farmers in Syrdarya region in exchange for assistance in solving 
their problems with local officials.
After being detained within the U/Ya 64/18 medical facility, Mr. 
Karamatov was transferred to the prison clinic, where he was diagnosed with an 
advanced form of tuberculosis in both lungs in October 2008. Since January 2011, 
he had been serving his sentence in a prison colony in Karshi. 
During his detention, he was subjected to several acts of 
ill-treatments and torture. On December 30, 2008, after refusing to admit a 
breach of the prison regime, Mr. Karamatov was forced to stand outside 
half-naked in freezing temperatures for almost four hours.
The health of Mr. Alisher Karamatov continued to deteriorate 
throughout 2010 for lack of appropriate medical care. In addition, he was not 
authorised to call home whereas each prisoner is normally entitled to four calls 
per year. On August 10, 2010, his wife was allowed to visit him for 40 minutes 
instead of the three-day visit she was normally entitled to, allegedly because 
of “a too high number of visitors”[1]. In December 2010, after meeting with representatives of the 
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Mr. Karamatov was harassed by 
law-enforcement agents[2].
After his wife visited him in April 2011, she had reported that 
Karamatov had lost weight and was very thin, had developed sores all over his 
body, and was waking up with traces of blood in his mouth. On April 25, 2011, 
Mr. Karamatov’s wife appealed to the Office of the Ombudsman, requesting that he 
be released on medical grounds due his critical health 
condition.

The facility comprises 18 visiting rooms for 3,000 prisoners. Similarly, on January 5, 2010, instead of three days, she could only see him one 
day.

He received a visit from an officer of the SNB, who asked many 
questions about his relatives. The Superintendent of the colony U/Ya 64/49 also 
met him, asking why he had spoken badly about the conditions in the colony to 
the ICRC representatives. When the ICRC visited Mr. Karamatov again mid-March 2011 they were 
this time accompanied by three members of the Uzbek 
police.
