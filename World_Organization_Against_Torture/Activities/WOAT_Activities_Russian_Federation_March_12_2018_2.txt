intervention in the following situation in the Russian Federation.
Description of the situation:

The OMCT and Promo-LEX has been informed by reliable sources about torture and the severely
deteriorating health condition of Mr. Vitalie Danu, a national of Moldova, detained in the
preventive isolator No.5 (СИЗО 5) in the Volgograd region of the Russian Federation.

In August 2015, Mr. Vitalie Danu travelled to the Russian Federation to find work when police
seized his car and allegedly found illegal drugs. Mr. Danu subsequently spent more than 2 years
in pre-trial detention before he was sentenced to 9 years in prison in October 2017.

In pre-trial detention he was subject to torture and other ill-treatment. On 3 and 4 February 2016,
three other cell mates physically tortured him until he lost conscious. His lawyer who tried to visit
him on the 4 and 5 February 2016 was refused access. A few days after the incident, he was forced
to sign a document stating that he waived the service of a translator for his criminal case and
another document that was a contract according to which he sold his car. The prison doctor who
treated him shortly after found injuries on his face, chest, abdomen, back and testicles. He was
subsequently operated on his reproductive organ; one of his testicles was removed in the health
care unit of the pre-trial detention center. Following his operation, he was diagnosed with Hepatitis
C, chronic gastritis and hemorrhoids, osteochondrosis of the vertebral column, and lymphocytosis
on his right foot. Mr. Danu’s health condition further worsened and he underwent another
operation for hernia in August 2017. He cannot walk without assistance and his trial dates have
been postponed several times because he was unable to attend court hearings. Despite repeated
complaints by his lawyer, Mr. Danu did not receive proper medical treatment to address his health
conditions.

In February 2016, Mr. Danu’s lawyer submitted a torture complaint upon which criminal
proceedings were initiated against one of his cell mates. In the course of the investigation, prison
authorities reported to the prosecutor that Mr. Danu’s injuries were caused by a fall from his bunk
bed. Mr. Danu, on the other hand, was never questioned by the prosecutor. Mr. Danu has not been
informed about the outcome of the investigation. There has been no investigation against prison
authorities who failed to protect Mr. Danu from torture and did not provide him with proper
medical treatment.







The last time Mr. Danu’s family has heard from him was in January 2018. There are since no news
about his health condition.

Actions requested:
Please write to the authorities of the Russian Federation asking them to:

i. Provide Mr. Vitalie Danu with access to an independent doctor in order to provide him
with adequate medical treatment in accordance with the provisions of the UN Standard
Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners;



Grant the right of communication with family members;



Conduct a thorough, impartial, and transparent criminal investigation into the above-

mentioned acts of torture in order to identify those responsible, bring them before a

competent and impartial tribunal, and apply to them the sanctions provided by the law;



Transfer Mr. Vitalie Danu to the Republic of Moldova for the execution of the

remainder of his sentence.
