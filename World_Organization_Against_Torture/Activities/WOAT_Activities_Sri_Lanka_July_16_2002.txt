Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Asian Human Rights Commission (AHRC), a member of the OMCT network, of the torture of two children by two police officers from the Hiniduma police station, Sri Lanka.   According to the information received, T. K. Hiran Rasika (10 ) and E. A. Kasun Madusanka (12), two boys studying at Millika Mahavidyala School in Hiniduma, were arrested on 9 July  2002 by two police officers who were investigating a theft which had taken place in the school cafeteria.  The two police officers brought the children to the police station and asked them to admit that they were involved in the theft. To force them to confess, the police officers allegedly hung them on beams by their legs and beat them. They also pulled their hair with pliers and inserted pins under their fingernails. The boys were hospitalised as a result of this torture.  According to AHRC, this type of situation can only occur because police discipline vis-à-vis human rights has collapsed in Sri Lanka, a situation which has encouraged widespread use of torture in police stations throughout the country. According to AHRC, torture has also been used on other children.  The international secretariat of OMCT is seriously concerned for the integrity of the children mentioned here, and, more generally, for all children that are brought to police stations. The international secretariat of OMCT wishes to recall that Sri Lanka, as a State Party to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, is obliged to respect all its articles; in particular article 37  that declares that “States Parties shall ensure that: a) No child shall be subjected to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.” Furthermore, this article demands that “c) Every child deprived of liberty shall be treated with humanity and respect for the inherent dignity of the human person, and in a manner which takes into account the needs of persons of his or her age.”    Action requested  Please write to the authorities in Sri Lanka urging them to:  ·	order a thorough and impartial investigation into the circumstances of this incident in order to identify those responsible, bring them to trial and apply the penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions as provided by law; ·	guarantee adequate reparation, including physical and psychological recovery, to the victims, and ensure their social reintegration;  ·	elaborate and implement preventive programmes, in particular by ensuring education and training for all personnel who may be involved in the custody, interrogation or treatment of any child subjected to any form of arrest, detention or imprisonment. This should include specific training in child psychology, child welfare and international standards and norms of human rights and children’s rights; ·	guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards, especially the Convention on the Rights of the Child.
