According to the information received, at about 5.00 pm on 14 January 2006, Mr. Saguinlao, an alleged member of the New People’s Army (NPA), was waiting at the seaport for a comrade when three men wearing plainclothes approached him. They grabbed his arms and aimed their .45 caliber pistols at him. Shortly after, three other men arrived, wearing fatigue uniforms, who also pointed their rifles at him. Mr. Saguinlao was searched and a .45 caliber pistol and his cell phone were taken from him. He was then taken to the police station for interrogation until 9.00 pm after which he was brought to the Battalion headquarter of 8th IB in Claveria, Misamis Oriental.   At the headquarter, he was allegedly handcuffed, punched twice in his stomach and chest, and slapped in the face every time military personnel came closer to him. Also, cellophane was wrapped around his head. Mr. Saguinlao reported that he was forced under torture to admit participation in the killing of a barangay official in Gingoog City. The interrogation went on until 4.00 am, on 15 January 2006. At 6.00 am, the interrogation resumed for another hour. Mr. Saguinlao reported that he was again tortured.
