According to the information received from the Liga Mexicana por la Defensa de los Derechos Humanos (LIMEDDH), Ms Juana Méndez Anyorve, aged 61, from Cruz Grande, Guerrero, a militant of the Partido de la Revolución Democrática (PRD) and member of the « Movimiento 6 de Marzo »,  has become, along with her husband and children, the object of serious threats and acts of  harassment since her release from prison. These circumstances have made her abandon her community, forcing her into a precarious and permanently unsafe situation.  The « Movimiento 6 de Marzo » is a legal movement, with essentially social aims, which fights for the fundamental rights of the peasant farmers in the region of the Costa Chica in Guerrero, near Acapulco. Ms Juana Méndez Anyorve has been active for many years, struggling to improve the social situation of the members of the Cruz Grande Community, and has never been involved in any armed or subversive movements.  According to the reports, in May 2000, a group of persons surrounded and threw stones at Ms Méndez Anyorve’s house, whilst two others kicked the door.  Since this date, 10 similar attacks have followed.  Ms Méndez Anyorve claims that Armando Ramos Brito, former municipal president of the of Tlacoschitlahuaca, is behind these acts, who purportedly offered 25,000 pesos for her or her husband’s head during his office.  In addition, presumably because of her militancy in the PRD, Ms Méndez Anyorve and her husband have been refused government welfare allocations from the programmes PROGRESA (grants awarded to the children and grandchildren of women in financial difficulty) and PROCAMPO (financial aid for farmers)  According to the reports, Ms Méndez Anyorve had to leave her community on 30 May 2000 due to this harassment, and her husband was also forced to leave when threatened with detention.  They now live in an extremely difficult economic situation, and constantly fear further persecution.  The International Secretariat of the OMCT shares the serious concern voiced by  Limeddh for the security and the physical and psycological integrity of Ms Juana Méndez Anyorve, of her husband and her family.  Brief reminder of the situation :  The International Secretariat of the OMCT was informed of the serious situation faced by Ms Juana  Méndez Anyorve, detained in the state of Guerrero in deplorable conditions and suffering from ill health.  (See OMCT Appeal MEX 290499).  According to the information received, she was held from 7 November 1998 in concerning conditions and in delicate health, refused access to medical treatment or an adequate diet, kept in isolation with severely restricted visits which were always attended by a guard.  She was constantly monitored and frequently threatened by penal authorities.  Furthermore, her trial was riddled with irregularities.  The International Secretariat was later informed by Limeddh that Ms Juana Méndez Anyorve was released on 15 May 1999 and that the charges against her had been dropped (See OMCT Appeal 290499.1).  Even though she was freed because penal action had been revoked, none of those responsible for the violations committed against her fundamental rights have so far not been sanctioned.  Requested Action:  Please write to the Mexican Authorities urging them to: i. take all measures necessary to guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of Ms and her family and to end their harassment; ii. order a thorough and impartial investigation into the above-mentioned events in order to identify those reponsible, bring them to justice and apply the civil, penal or adminstrative sanctions stipulted by law; iii. fully execute the recommendations made by international and regional human rights organisations, including those of the High Commission for Human Rights, the United Nations Human Rights Commission, the Inter.American Human Rights Commission as well as national and governmental human rights organisations; iv. guarantee the respect of human rights and fundamental liberties in all the country in accordance with national law and international human rights norms.
