		The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint 
partnership of FIDH and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), 
requests your intervention in the following situation in  
Russia.

		 

Description of the situation:

		 

		The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the sentencing 
and arbitrary detention of Mr. Lev Ponomarev, Executive 
Director of the Moscow-based “For Human Rights” movement[1], for his support to peaceful 
rallies organised to protest the criminalisation of youth groups under 
anti-terrorist laws.

		 

		According to the information received, on December 7, 2018, the Moscow 
City Court confirmed in appeal the conviction of Mr. Ponomarev pronounced 
two days before by the Moscow’s Tverskoy District Court for organising 
a rally. However, due to Mr. Ponomarev’s health condition, the 
sentence was reduced to 16 days of detention, including the time already 
served.

		 

		The court found Mr. Ponomarev guilty under part 8 ofArticle 20.2 of the 
Administrative Code of Russian Federation of “repeated violation of 
the established procedure for conducting a rally” for reposting on his 
Facebook page a public call encouraging citizens to attend a 
peaceful rally outside of the Federal Security Service (FSB) headquarters in 
Moscow. According to the Federal Law N 54-FZ “On Assemblies, Meetings, 
Demonstrations, Rallies and Pickets”, any call to participate in a 
rally amounts to its organisation.

		 

		The charges relate to the reposting on October 25, 2018 by Mr. Ponomarev 
of an earlier announcement made on the website of the radio station Echo 
of Moscow calling for participation in the October 28, 2018, action 
called “For your children and ours!”[2], organised in solidarity with a group of 
more than 20 young activists detained on trumped-up ‘terrorism’ 
and ‘extremism’ charges
 [3]. Mr. Lev Ponomarev was also instrumental in seeking the approval 
for the peaceful marches with the authorities, which was denied.

		 

		More than 1,000 people participated in the rally on October 28, 2018, in 
four Russian cities. 58 persons were arrested in Moscow and Saint 
Petersburg.

		 

		According to the same information, Mr. Ponomarev had previously faced 
harassment for his actions of protest against the harassment of the same 
youth groups. On July 31, 2018, Mr. Lev Ponomarev was fined with 10,000 
rubles (around 130 Euros) for holding a one-man picket in support for two 
female activists accused in the “Novoye Velichiye” case, which 
made the presently impugned offence “repeated”. Moreover, on 
December 10, Moscow’s Tverskoy District Court rejected Mr. 
Ponomarev’s request to attend the funeral of the head of the Moscow 
Helsinki Group, human rights defender Lyudmila Alekseeva, 
who died on December 8, 2018, at 92 years old.

		 

		The Observatory notes that the current established procedure for 
conducting a rally contradicts existing, standards on freedom of assembly at 
European and international level, as stated by the Council of Europe 
Commissioner for Human Rights 
[4], as well as the European Commission for  Democracy through Law 
(the Venice Commission)[5] 
.

		 

		Lawyers at “For Human Rights” have filed an application 
requesting the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) to intervene in the 
case of Mr. Lev Ponomarev. They asked the ECtHR to consider the appeal on a 
priority basis (in accordance with Rule No. 41 of the Rules of Court) and to 
urge the Russian government not to keep Mr. Ponomarev under arrest (Rule No. 
39).

		 

		The Observatory strongly condemns the sentencing and arbitrary detention 
on Mr. Lev Ponomarev, as it seems only aimed at punishing him for his 
legitimate exercise of his right to freedom of assembly and expression. The 
Observatory calls on the Russian authorities to end any act of harassment, 
includingat the judicial level, against him and all human rights defenders 
in the country.

		 

Actions requested:

		 

		Please write to the authorities of Russia asking them to:

		 

		i. Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity 
of Mr. Lev Ponomarev and all human rights defenders in the Russian 
Federation;

		 

		ii. Immediately and unconditionally release Mr. Lev Ponomarev, as his 
detention is arbitrary and merely aimed at punishing him for his human 
rights activities;

		 

		iii. Put an end to all acts of harassment, including at the judicial 
level, against him and all human rights defenders arbitrarily detained in 
the country and guarantee in all circumstances their right to a fair 
trial;

		 

		iv. Amend the legislation regulating freedom of assembly so as to uphold 
the highest international human rights law standards in line with the 
recommendations issued by the Venice Commission and the Council of Europe 
Commissioner for Human Rights;

		 

		v. Comply with all the provisions of the United Nations Declaration on 
Human Rights Defenders adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 9, 
1998, in particular its Articles 1, 6(a), 9, 11 and 12.2;

		 

		vi. Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental 
freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and 
international instruments ratified by Russia.

  Between October and November 2017, the FSB detained 11 young men on 
suspicion of participating in a terrorist community called the 
“Network” under article 205.4 of the Criminal Code of the 
Russian Federation. The case is based primarily on confessions extracted by 
the FSB agents, and several suspects say they were tortured into 
incriminating themselves. In March 2018, the Russian authorities brought 
criminal charges against another group of young men and women for having 
allegedly organized an extremist community called the “Novoye 
Velichiye” (“New Greatness”).
