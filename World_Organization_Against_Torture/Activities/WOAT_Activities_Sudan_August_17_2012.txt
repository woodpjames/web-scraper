Here, they were subjected to serious acts of torture and mistreatment. Their alleged cooperation with the International Criminal Court (ICC) in the case pending against the Sudanese President, Omar Al Bashir.After their release, the three human rights defenders resolved to bring their torturers to justice. This resolve was one founded not only on their own entitlement to justice but was also pursued for the hundreds of other Sudanese citizens, including human rights activists and political opponents, who continue to suffer acts of torture at the hands of NISS agents. Facing an entirely state-controlled judicial system, the three human rights defenders decided to turn to the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights (ACHPR). Their complaint, filed in 2009, has just been declared admissible by the ACHPR. The Commission indeed found that the weaknesses of the Sudanese judicial system prevented them from obtaining redress at national level.The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders (FIDH – OMCT), representing Osman Hummeida, Amir Suliman and Monim Elgak before the ACHPR, welcomes this important decision, which opens a door for all NISS victims. The Observatory will continue to stand with them to encourage the Commission to adopt a decision on the substantive merits of the case that recognises their suffering and addresses strong recommendations to the Sudanese authorities to end the climate of lawlessness and impunity prevailing in the country.
