Brief description of the situation:  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by Agir Ensemble pour les Droits de l'Homme, a member of the OMCT network, of the disappearance of Mr. Olivier Mubiligi, since the beginning of March, 2001, following death threats allegedly made by the Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA).   According to the information received, Mr. Mubiligi reportedly believes that the repeated death threats, that ultimately have forced him into hiding, are due to the fact that he knows the identities of those guilty of murdering his uncle, Mr. Nkezabangwa Vincent, on February 15, 1997 in Gizozi. Mr. Nkezabangwa Vincent was the ex vice-president of Rwanda's Supreme Court, and was allegedly murdered by members of the RPA. The RPA are thought to be threatening to kill Mr. Mubiligi in order to ensure that he does not testify against them before the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR).  OMCT is gravely concerned about Mr. Mubiligi's physical and psychological integrity, given these alleged death threats. OMCT is also concerned about the RPA's reported use of intimidation, and potentially murder, in order to protect its members and pervert the course of justice.  Action requested:  Please write to the authorities of Rwanda urging them to: i.	guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Olivier Mubiligi; ii.	guarantee an impartial and exhaustive inquiry into alleged use of intimidation by the RPA, bring those responsible before a competent and impartial tribunal and apply the penal, civil and administrative sanctions provided by law; iii.	guarantee Mr. Olivier Mubiligi's protection and enable him to testify in any future ICTR hearings concerning the death of Mr. Nkezabangwa Vincent. iv.	adopt immediate measures to put an end to the use of intimidation and death threats by the RPA;  v.	ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.  Please also write to the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda urging them to: i.      adopt immediate measures to locate Mr Mubiligi and provide him with adequate protection.
