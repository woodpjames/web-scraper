Brief description of the situation:  The Observatory has been informed of the attack, on 14 August 2003,  of the office of the human rights organisation Memorial Saint  Petersburg and its staff.  According to the information received, on 14 August 2003, a young man  arrived at the Memorial office, allegedly looking for those in charge  of the anti-fascist commission, on the pretext that his sister had  been killed by a fascist group. The anti-fascist commission staff not  being available, the man was advised to return when the Chairman of  Memorial Saint Petersburg, Vladimir Schnitke would be back.  The young man came back later on with another man to see Mr Schnitke.  The two men threatened a member of staff with hammers, and tore off  the telephone cable so as to prevent her from using it. They gagged  her and tied up her hands. She was then locked up in a closet.  Afterward they went to Vladimir Schnitke's office and claimed they  belonged to the "Committee for the defense of Budanov", which nobody  appears to have heard of. This name probably refers to Colonel  Budanov, a Russian colonel convicted of having abducted and murdered  a young Chechen woman in 2000.   After having asked Schnitke where the main computer was, they seized  the Chairman's laptop computer and his mobile phone. Vladimir  Schnitke and a third member of staff were then gagged, their hands  tied up, and were locked up in the closet. The assailants blocked the  door of the closet, and pretended they had booby-trapped it. The  staff of Memorial was released later on that day, after a visitor  called the police.  The two men also stole Vladimir Schnitke's pocket computer, his diary  and his address book. They left a note saying "Free Buda...",  obviously referring to Colonel Budanov.  The Press Department of the Department of Internal Affairs (MVD)  declared that the attack was an ordinary burglary and that it was not  politically motivated. The police consequently opened an  investigation for burglary. However, the two men did not steal any  money nor other computers apart from Vladimir Schnitke's one.  The Observatory is very concerned by those events, and in particular  by the fact that the staff of Memorial were physically assaulted and  threatened. Moreover, the Observatory fears that the aim of the  attack was to obtain information on the activities of Memorial Saint  Petersburg, its members and contacts.  The Observatory recalls that under article 12(2) of the Declaration  on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the United Nations General  Assembly on 9 December 1998, " the State shall take all necessary  measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of  everyone, individually and in association with others, against any  violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse  discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a  consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred  to in the present Declaration".  Actions requested:  Please write to the Russian authorities urging them to:  i.Guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of all members  of Memorial Saint Petersburg in all circumstances; ii.To ensure that no pressure or intimidation actions are exercised  on Memorial Saint Petersburg, and that the organisation can carry out  its activities without being subjected to outside hindrance; iii.To conduct a fair, impartial and independent inquiry into these  events, in order to identify the authors, bring them to justice and  pronounce sentences proportional to the gravity of their crimes; iv.To comply with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human  Rights Defenders, in particular article 1, which states that  "everyone has the right, individually or in association with others,  to promote and to strive for the protection and realization of human  rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international  levels", and above mentioned article 12(2); v.More generally, to abide by the international and regional  instruments protecting human rights ratified by Russia, in particular  the Charter of Paris and the documents adopted under the OSCE's Human  Dimension.
