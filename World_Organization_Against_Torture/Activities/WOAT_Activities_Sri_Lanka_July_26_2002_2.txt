Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Asian Human Rights Commission, a member of the OMCT network, of the arbitrary arrest and torture of 60-year old Mr. Arthur Vithanage and threats directed towards his 20-year old daughter Ms. Anusha Vithana on June 30th 2002, in Sri Lanka.  According to the information received, at about 1p.m. on June 30th 2002, a police jeep no. GB-8466 arrived at Mr. Vathanage’s house demanding to be informed of the whereabouts of his son Jayantha. Mr. Vathanage was then reportedly beaten with a club and dragged behind the house. While Mr. Vathanage was being dragged, he fell over repeatedly and was beaten every time he fell. While Mr. Vathanage was being beaten, his daughter Ms. Vithana rushed to his aid. Sergeant Vithana allegedly beat her with a baton, insulted her using sexually explicit language and ordered her to leave the scene.  According to the report, Mr. Vathanage was severely beaten and threatened by both Sub Inspector Thennekone and Sergeant Ajith Vithana behind the house, and the police officers threatened to break Mr. Vathanage’s leg in order to draw his son, Jayanatha, out of hiding. Mr. Vathanage was then taken inside the police jeep where his head was pushed against an iron bar while he continued to be beaten. Ms. Vithana begged the police to leave her father alone, but the police officers subsequently threatened to rape and kill her.  Mr. Vathanage was reportedly taken to the police station where he was subjected to further torture before being put into a cell. At 12.30 pm on July 1st 2002, Mr. Vathanage was taken out of his cell at which time the police threatened him by saying that his son’s hands and legs would be broken. Mr. Vathanage was made to sign a document and was then put back in his cell.  According to the report, Mr. Vathanage was presented before the Magistrate on the same day at 2p.m., and he was charged with helping a suspect escape and subsequently released on bail.  Mr. Vathanage reportedly went to the hospital later on the same day and was hospitalised until July 3rd 2002. The medical report proves that Mr. Vathanage was subjected to severe torture, including being hit with a blunt weapon. His injuries reportedly included a bruise covering the back of his right leg and the middle finger of his right hand was fractured and dislocated. Ms. Vithana is also undergoing treatment for her injuries. While in hospital, Mr. Vathanage filed a complaint with the hospital police. Shortly afterwards, he also filed complaints with the Superintendent of Police in Kalutara, the Inspector General of Police and the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka, but as of yet, no action has reportedly been taken as a result.  The International Secretariat of OMCT condemns the arbitrary arrest and physical assault that Mr. Piyaratne was subjected to. OMCT is gravely concerned by the beatings and threats of torture including rape to which Ms. Anusha Vithana was subjected by the Sri Lankan authorities. OMCT is also gravely concerned about yet another report of the Sri Lankan Police’s use of arbitrary arrests, detentions and torture. OMCT fears that the perpetrators of these human rights violations will continue to enjoy impunity and that Mr. Piyaratne’s family will not be granted adequate reparation. Furthermore, OMCT recalls that torture is a crime under Act No. 22 of Sri Lanka law with a minimum sentence of 7 years and is a grave violation of human rights. OMCT decries the lack of a functioning system in Sri Lanka for the investigation and prosecution of perpetrators of such human rights violations and the lack of a working mechanism for compensating the victims of these acts.
