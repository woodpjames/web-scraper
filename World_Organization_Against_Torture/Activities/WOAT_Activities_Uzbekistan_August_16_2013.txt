The Observatory
for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the
International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation
Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent intervention in the following
situation in Uzbekistan.

Description of the situation:
 
The Observatory has been informed
by reliable sources about the sentencing in absentia of Ms. Nadejda Atayeva, a human rights defender from
Uzbekistan, currently the President of the Association for Human Rights in
Central Asia living in France. Her father, Mr. Alim Atayev, and her brother,
Mr. Karhamon Atayev, have likewise been sentenced. They all left Uzbekistan in
2000 and arrived in France in 2002, where they were granted political asylum.
 
According to the information
received, on July 24, 2013, Judge Bahram Tashpulatov of the Tashkent City Court
sentenced Ms. Nadejda Atayeva, Mr. Alim Atayev and Mr. Karhamon Atayev to
respectively six, nine and seven years of penal colony. Ms. Atayeva was found
guilty of violation of three articles of the Criminal Code of Uzbekistan:
"larceny by way of embezzlement of property" (Article 167), "forgery in office for the benefit of an organised
group" (Article 209) and "legalisation of revenue from criminal
activities" (Article 243). The charges were linked to her father's
position as the head of the corporation 'Uzlehleboprodukt'; they were brought
after Mr. Alim Atayev refused to cooperate with the regime on the falsification
of statistics related to grain production in Uzbekistan. The criminal process
started on April 7, 2000 and was preceded by harassment and threats, which was
the reason why the family fled Uzbekistan.
 
The July 24, 2013 verdict was
pronounced without the knowledge or presence of Ms. Atayeva and her family.
Their representatives were not informed either. Ms. Atayeva found out about the
trial by chance on July 22, 2013. She hired a lawyer, Mr. Tulkin Arifzhanov,
who met the Judge on July 25, 2013 in order to obtain a copy of the verdict,
which was made available to him only on August 1, 2013. On that day it also
transpired that each of the convicts had been assigned a State lawyer who had
received the verdict already on July 24, 2013. 
 
Ms. Atayeva and her family do not
know the State lawyers and have no contact with them. Nevertheless, they were
given 10 days counting from July 24, 2013, until August 5, 2013, to appeal the
verdict. As the verdict, covering 45 pages, was in Uzbek, a language that Ms.
Atayeva does not speak, she had to have it translated into her native language,
Russian. The verdict further stated that should Ms. Atayeva wish to appeal the
decision, she must do it in person in Uzbekistan. In spite of these
circumstances, Ms. Atayeva managed to prepare an appeal of the verdict and
submit it to the court through her lawyer on August 5, 2013. In the appeal she
categorically denies the charges made against her and calls for an independent
judicial system in Uzbekistan, for the end of fabricated charges and for the
end of torture during investigations and in penitentiary institutions. Although
the court did not accept the appeal, Ms. Atayeva nevertheless sent it on August
5, 2013, by registered post. She is now waiting for an answer. 
 
The Observatory denounces the in
absentia trial and verdict pronounced against Ms. Atayeva and her family
and the ensuing steps taken to de facto prevent her from appealing the
decision, which are flagrant violations to the right to a fair trial and
defence, as guaranteed under international law, in particular the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), as well as Uzbekistan's own
Constitution. The Observatory considers it to be an act of harassment of Ms.
Atayeva aimed at punishing and delegitimising her work on human rights over the
past years.

i. Take all
necessary measures to guarantee that Ms. Atayeva's appeal is duly reviewed in a
