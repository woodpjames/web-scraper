New information:  The Observatory has been informed by a reliable source that the charges against Mr. Muhamad Mugraby, a lawyer at the Beirut Bar and human rights activist who was prosecuted for “defamation of the military and its members” (Article 157 of the Military Criminal Code) since February 2005, were dropped.  According to the information received, on April 15, 2006, the Military Court of Cassation decided that Mr. Mugraby’s statement at the European Parliament in November 2003 (See background information) had to be considered as “general criticism [...] and [did not] show at all an intention of slandering” the military and its members. The Court also judged that the Permanent Military Court, which on March 20, 2006 declared itself competent to try him, did not have any “jurisdiction to look into such a case”.  The Observatory welcomes this decision, and thanks all the persons, organisations and institutions who intervened in favour of Mr. Muhamad Mugraby.   However, the Observatory recalls that the two appeals filed by Mr. Mugraby with the Court of Appeal against the decisions of two disciplinary commissions of the Bar of Beirut (dating back to 2002 and 2003) that had withdrawn his right to exercise the profession, and the two legal actions filed by Mr. Mugraby with the Court of Appeal, respectively against thirteen judges involved in his August 2003 arrest and against the National Bar Association, remain pending (See Observatory 2005 Annual Report). Background information: On February 26, 2005, Mr. Muhamad Mugraby, particularly renowned as a legal counsel for political opponents and his restless fight against corruption in Lebanese legal circles, was called in for questioning by the Beirut General Security Forces. Mr. Mugraby was notably interrogated about a statement he made in November 2003 before the Mashrek Committee of the European Parliament, and in which he had denounced the failures of the Lebanese judicial system and mentioned his arbitrary detention earlier in August that year. Police officers, in particular, asked him to detail his position on the military justice system in the country.  On March 20, 2006, the Permanent Military Court declared itself competent to try Mr. Mugraby, who decided to appeal this decision before the Military Court of Cassation.
