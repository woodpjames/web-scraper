This report
describes OMCT’s implementation of the project “Preventing torture and
other forms of violence by acting on their economic, social and cultural root
causes” during the
period 2007 to 2010. 
 
The project aimed at preventing torture and other
forms of violence (cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, arbitrary detention,
summary executions and enforced disappearances) by acting on the root causes
found in the failure to respect economic, social and cultural rights. The means used were strengthening national
NGOs, expanding the NGO network and, using UN human rights implementation
machinery and other means, to address the root causes of violence. 
 
The European Union, through the
European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights, provided substantial
support for this project, which was also supported by the Interchurch
Organisation for Development Cooperation (ICCO), the Karl Popper Foundation and
the Foundation for Human Rights at Work. The Swiss Agency for Development and
Cooperation (DDC) supported this project in 2007 and 2008.
