Estimates put the  number of people affected by the mine at anything between 50,000 and  500,000, including a  number of indigenous communities. Many of these affected will be forced  to leave their homes  and land.A public demonstration against the mine in August 2006 saw at least five  persons killed and  fifty others injured by the police and personnel of the Bangladesh  Rifles. OMCT expresses its  serious concern that further violence, ill-treatment and even deaths may  ensue if local  communities again seek to give public expression to their opposition.  To prevent further human right violations, and having regard to the  strong local opposition to  the project, OMCT calls upon the Government of the People’s Republic of  Bangladesh to  instigate a thorough independent investigation into the human and  environmental impact of the  Phulbari coal mine project, ensuring the full and informed participation  of all local  communities, to make the findings of this investigation available in a  public report and to abide  by the recommendations of this report. It also calls for the Government  to lift the restrictions on  public demonstrations imposed under emergency rule and take all  necessary steps to prevent  future episodes of violence by police and security forces against  persons defending their human  rights.OMCT calls upon Global Coal Management Resources Plc (GCM) - the company  in charge  of the Phulbari project - to suspend its activities in this area until  this investigation has been  conducted and to abide by the recommendations resulting from this  investigation. It also calls  upon GCM to fully respect the land rights, resources and livelihoods of  all local communities  affected by any subsequent mining activity and provide fair and adequate  compensation  wherever appropriate.Finally, OMCT calls upon UBS, RAB Capital and Barclays, all of which  have significant  financial interest in GCM, to use their influence to ensure that the  company abides by the  recommendations issuing from the independent investigation and to make  certain that it  complies fully with national laws and international human rights  standards.
