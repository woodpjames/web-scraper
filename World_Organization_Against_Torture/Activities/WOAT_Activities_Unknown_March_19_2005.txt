The conference understood violence in its broadest sense, including State-sponsored violence (e.g., torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, summary executions, disappearances, etc.), violence by non-State actors, social violence, and domestic violence. Its work was based on an interdisciplinary study entitled “Poverty, inequality and violence: the economic, social and cultural root causes of violence, including torture, a human rights perspective”. The conference and the study were part of a project carried out from 2003 to 2005 by OMCT within the programme of the Geneva International Academic Network (GIAN) and with the financial support of the GIAN, the Dutch Foundation ICCO (Interchurch Organisation for Development Cooperation), the Geneva-based Fondation des droits de l’homme au travail and the Swiss Federal Government (Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation). Guided by a Scientific Council 7, its ultimate objective was to identify specific actions that various actors could take to reduce violence by acting on its economic, social and cultural root causes.
