Brief description of the situation:The Observatory has been informed about the arbitrary detention and acts of harassment against Mr. Liu Zhengyou, a land rights activist in the Zigong, Sichuan province.  According to the information received, on June 16, 2006, Mr. Liu Zhengyou was arrested by police officers as he tried to board a plane to come to Geneva, Switzerland, where he was to attend a human rights training provided by the International Service for Human Rights (ISHR), from June 17 to 25, 2006.   Although Mr. Liu had obtained the necessary travel documents and had made preparations in accordance with relevant regulations, when he arrived at the Beijing airport to board his flight, he was stopped by members of the airport security and the Beijing police. One police officer told him that the Zigong Municipal Public Security Bureau (PSB) and Sichuan Provincial PSB had requested the police to prevent him from going to Geneva to attend this meeting. He was then transferred into the custody of policemen from Zigong and officials from the Zigong government’s Beijing office. No warrant of arrest was presented to Mr. Liu in order to justify his custody. The officers put Mr. Liu on a train back to Sichuan in the afternoon of June 16, 2006. He was then escorted by policemen.  Back in Zigong, Mr. Liu was detained at the Huidong Branch of the Zigong PSB, where he was questioned by police officials as a “criminal suspect” for his role in the April 20 “illegal demonstration” (See background information). On June 17, 2006, the police issued a notification for questioning him. By then, he had been detained for 37 hours. After questioning him for two hours, the police sent him home but said he would have to return for more questioning later. He finally arrived at home around 2 a.m. on June 18, 2006.  The Observatory expresses its deep concern about these events, all the more that China is member of the new United Nations Human Rights Council. Background information:During the past ten years, Mr. Liu Zhengyou has been deeply involved in efforts to protect the rights of local farmers, who were forcibly evicted from their land (on which their housing and livelihood depend) without being properly consulted or fairly compensated.  Indeed, in 1993, Zigong officials began to seize more than 2,500 acres of farm land, on which 30,000 farmers had lived for generations. The farmers were offered small living stipends and what they considered inadequate compensation, so they refuse to relocate and organised sit-ins. Police came to the villages many times to “clean out” villagers. Between 1995 and 2005, Mr. Liu Zhengyou, who had been designated by the farmers as their leader, petitioned the government for investigation and review. On April 20, 2005, villagers tried to hand in a petition to the Mayor of Zigong, but were stopped by the police. During the altercation with the police, several villagers were badly injured, including Mr. Liu. Mr. Liu and several others were then briefly detained for “disorderly conduct” and “obstruction of traffic”. Actions required:Please write to the Chinese authorities urging them to: i.	Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Liu Zhengyou;  ii.	Put an end to any kind of harassment against Mr. Liu Zhengyou, as well as against all human rights defenders in China;  iii.	Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, and article 12.2, which states that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”;  iv.	Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by the People’s Republic of China.
