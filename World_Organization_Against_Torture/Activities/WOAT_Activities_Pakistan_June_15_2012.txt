The 
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of 
the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation 
Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent intervention in the following 
situation in Pakistan.
 
Description 
of the situation:
 
The 
Observatory has been informed by reliable sources of death threats against Ms. 
Asma Jahangir, a prominent lawyer, FIDH Vice-President, founder member, former 
Chairperson and current board member of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan 
(HRCP), and former United Nations Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or 
Belief.
 
According 
to the information received, early June 2012, Ms. Jahangir was informed by a 
source she believes to be highly reliable that Pakistani intelligence 
authorities were planning to murder her. Following these threats, she decided to 
remain in her residence, fearing for her life. She finally disclosed this to 
Pakistani TV news channels on June 4, 
2012, 
revealing that the plan to kill her had been plotted by the "highest level" of 
state agencies.
 
These 
threats come in the wake of Ms. Jahangir’s work to shed light on human rights 
violations carried out by security forces in the Pakistani 
province of 
Balochistan. In 
several television programmes and during interviews, she identified the security 
agencies and the Frontier Corps as being responsible for disappearances and 
killings in Balochistan. In addition, she underlined the role played by military 
agencies regarding human rights abuses perpetrated across the 
country.
 
The 
Observatory recalls that Ms. Jahangir had already been threatened because of her 
human rights activities: for instance, in 2007, the authorities put her under 
house arrest to prevent her from attending a meeting for the reinstatement of 
the superior court judges. As early as 1995, an attempt was made on her life, 
and when two individuals were arrested in relation to the case, it was found 
that they reportedly had links with members of the intelligence 
services.
 
The 
Observatory condemns the above-mentioned death threats against Ms. Asma 
Jahangir, which clearly appear to be linked to her human rights activities, and 
which aim at silencing her. The Observatory expresses its deepest concern 
regarding her physical and psychological integrity.
 
Actions requested: 
The Observatory urges the authorities of 
Pakistan 
to:
 
i.         
Guarantee 
the physical and psychological integrity of Ms. Asma Jahangir and, more 
generally, of all human rights defenders in 
Pakistan; 

 
ii.       
Carry 
out an effective, thorough and impartial investigation into the above-mentioned 
threats, in order to identify all those responsible, bring them before a civil, 
competent and impartial tribunal, and apply to them the penal sanctions provided 
by the law. 
 
iii.      
Put 
an end to any act of harassment against Ms. Asma Jahangir and against all 
human rights defenders in Pakistan; 

iv.     
Conform 
in any circumstances with the provisions of the Declaration on Human Rights 
Defenders, adopted on December 9, 1998 by the United Nations General Assembly, 
in particular : its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, 
individually or in association with others, to promote the protection and 
realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and 
international levels” ;
-          its 
Article 6 (c) which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in 
association with others to study, discuss, form and hold opinions on the 
observance, both in law and in practice, of all human rights and fundamental 
freedoms and, through these and other appropriate means, to draw public 
attention to those matters” ;
-          and 
its Article 12.2 which states that “the State shall take all necessary measures 
to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually 
and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de 
facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action 
as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in 
the present Declaration”.
 
vi. 
   Ensure in all circumstances respect for 
human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human 
rights standards and international instruments ratified by 
Pakistan.
