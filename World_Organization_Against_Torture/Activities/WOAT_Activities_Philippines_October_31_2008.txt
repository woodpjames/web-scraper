Brief description of the situation: The Observatory has been informed by the Task Force Detainees of the Philippines (TFDP) about the enforced disappearance of Mr. Norbeto Murillo, a technical consultant for the farmers’ organisation Life and Food for Leyte Evacuees (LFLE). According to the information received, on October 30, 2008 in the morning, Mr. Noberto Murillo was abducted by three men, who reportedly identified themselves as operatives of the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG), outside the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) building. Mr. Murillo was abducted after having a meeting at the DAR to follow up on the documents regarding a LFLE land claim for alienable and disposal land in Leyte. According to Mr. Paulo Dellosa, LFLE Chairperson, the three men showed Mr. Murillo a warrant of arrest and introduced themselves as CIDG operatives after which they forcibly dragged him to a waiting FX vehicle. As of issuing this urgent appeal, the identity of Mr. Murillo’s abductors and his place of detention remain unknown. LFLE represents farmers who were displaced from their farmlands in Leyte during the late 80’s due to the effect of former President Corazon Aquino’s “Total War Policy”; after being displaced from Leyte these farmers sought temporary refuge at the Polytechnic University of the Philippines under then University President Nemesio Prudente. The Observatory expresses its deep concern with Mr. Noberto Murillo’s enforced disappearance, which is further evidence of the wave of repression against human rights defenders in the Philippines, and recalls that the Philippines has been elected as a member of the Human Rights Council until 2010 and has, in this regard, committed to “uphold the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights”[1]. Accordingly, the Observatory urges the Philippines to comply with Article 12.2 of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 9, 1998, which states that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any threats, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”. Actions required: Please write to the authorities of the Philippines urging them to:   Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Noberto Murillo and of all human rights defenders in the Philippines;  Take prompt action in order to locate Mr. Noberto Murillo, make public his whereabouts, and ensure his immediate release since his detention is arbitrary as it merely aims at sanctioning his human rights activities;  End all forms of harassment, including judicial harassment, again human rights defenders in the Philippines, and guarantee in all circumstances that they be able to carry out their work without any hindrance;  Conform with all the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, especially its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels” and above-mentioned Article 12.2;  More generally, ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by the Philippines.
