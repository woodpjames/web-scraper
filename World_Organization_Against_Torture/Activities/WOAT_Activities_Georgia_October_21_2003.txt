It will probably be passed in December 2003 or January 2004. If  passed, this law would seriously hinder Human Rights Defenders'  activities, and put them under the constant threat of being closed  down without previous notice.   A first draft of this law, entitled law "On Suspension of Activities,  Liquidation and Banning of Extremist Organizations and Organizations  under Foreign Control" was introduced on 18 February 2003 by the  Ministry of Security. The original draft provided the Ministry with  the power of suspending, liquidating, and banning any organization  "under foreign control" and/or acting "against the interests of  Georgia". However the draft law did not define the constitutive  elements of actions "against the interests of Georgia", nor did it  provide for criteria for considering the activities of an  organization as terrorist or extremist. The suspending of activities  or closing down by the Ministry of Justice were not subject to the  right of appeal in national courts.  Due to protests and pressure of civil society and international  experts, the Ministry of Security modified the draft law, and the  provisions regarding "organizations under foreign control" were  omitted. Article 4 of the current draft law "On Suspension of  Activities, Liquidation and Banning of Extremist Organizations"  enables the Ministry to ban organizations which show signs of  extremism, whether in activities conducted or planned, or in  statements made by heads or members and alluding to the need for a  new government, or constituting a threat for Georgian sovereignty or  territorial integrity.   According to Article 5, if such extremist activities or statements  occur, the Ministry of Security warns the organization. On the second  warning, the Ministry refers the case to the Constitutional Court or  to the Supreme Court. In case of emergency, the Ministry can refer  the case without any previous warning.  The Observatory is particularly worried that this law, if passed,  will put NGOs and Human Rights Defenders under constant monitoring  from the authorities, and constant threat of being closed down for  actions of statements arbitrarily deemed "extremist".  The Observatory recalls that Article 1 of the Declaration on Human  Rights Defenders  provides for the right to "promote and to strive  for the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental  freedoms at the national and international levels." Moreover, Article  2 provides that "each State shall adopt such legislative,  administrative and other steps as may be necessary to ensure that the  rights and freedoms referred to in the present Declaration are  effectively guaranteed".  The Observatory is all the more concerned by the adverse effects that  the law will have on NGOs as it comes within the scope of a context  of obstacles to the activities of Human Rights Defenders. The  situation of Human Rights Defenders, which the Observatory denounced  in 2002 (see Human Rights Defenders on the Front Line - Annual Report  2002) indeed remains unchanged. In March 2002, Georgian highest  authorities compared NGO's activities to those of terrorists and  called for strict financial control.   On 17 September 2003, the participants to a demonstration organized  by the Union of Environmental Protection and Animal Rights ("Lobo")  were attacked and beaten up  by the police and local authorities. The demonstrators requested the  modification of the planned route of a new pipeline that is due to  cross Borjomi.  In July 2003, Mr Grigol Khurtsilava was sentenced to 13 years  imprisonment. He was charged with the murder of Giorgi Sanaya, a  journalist of Rustavi 2 TV channel known  for his denunciations of official corruption, who was shot dead on 26  July 2001. Mr. Khurtsilava confessed to the killing of Mr Sanaya and  denied any political motivation.  However, this version of the facts is open to serious doubts.  Witnesses were apparently threatened during the trial.  In April 2003, Giorgi Lagidze, a member of the Public Control Council  of the Penitentiary System of the Ministry of Justice, was denied  access to the juvenile facility of a  prison. He requested to be provided with the list of persons in  charge of the monitoring in the prison facilities. The Deputy  Director of the Regime and Security Department  subsequently beat him up.  Also in April 2003, the office of the Fund of Georgian Human Rights  Defense was attacked by unidentified men. Technical equipment and  documentation were stolen.  According to the Head of the organization, this was aimed at  preventing the release of information about violations by the police.  The Sachkhere branch of the Fund has  already been robbed four times.  In January 2003, representatives of NGOs belonging to the independent  council of public control of the Ministry of Justice were precluded  from conducting an investigation at  Tibilisi Jail Number 5. The penitentiary authorities argued that a  riot had taken place a few days earlier, and that the  representatives' security could not be guaranteed.  The Observatory urges the authorities of Georgia to amend the draft  law "On Suspension of Activities, Liquidation and Banning of  Extremist Organizations" so that it  conforms with Georgia's regional and international obligations, and  more particularly the International Covenant on Civil and Political  Rights and the U.N. Declaration on  Human Rights Defenders. Furthermore, the Observatory urges the  authorities of Georgia to ensure that the individuals responsible for  attacks of NGOs and aggressions of  their members are subject to an independent trial and punished  according to  national laws in force.  The FIDH will refer the case to Mrs. Hina Jilani, Special  Representative of the Secretary-General on Human Rights Defenders,  and to the relevant OSCE bodies, and urges the authorities to invite  the Special Representative to Georgia in order to assess the  situation.
