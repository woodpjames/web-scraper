The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of
the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation
Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent intervention in the following
situation in Kenya.
 
Description
of the situation: 
 
The
Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the administrative
harassment of the Kenyan Human Rights Commission (KHRC), a human rights
organisation advocating for the promotion of human rights, democratic values
and social justice in Kenya. 
 
According
to the information received, on October 28, 2015, the KHRC became aware, through
the media, of the decision of the Kenyan NGO Coordination Board (the Board) to
de-register 957 Kenyan organisations, if they failed to present audited
accounts to the Board within a 14-day notice. The KHRC was among the NGOs
listed by the Board. 
 
Subsequently,
the KHRC wrote to the Board to request further information on the allegations
and the motivations of the decision highlighting that there had been no prior
warning, communication or enquiry to the KHRC regarding the status of their
returns. In a press release dated October 28, 2015, the Board accused the
organisation of failing to account around KES 1.2 billion (approx. 10 million
Euros), managing four illegal accounts, and transmitting inaccurate financial
reports. The KHRC responded that it had complied with all regulatory and legal
requirements and decided to respond to both the KHRC's and broader sectoral
issues, using this challenge as an opportunity to denounce recent restrictions
and call for the respect the civic space for all.
 
On October 30, 2015, the Cabinet Secretary
for Devolution and National Planning ordered the revocation of the decision to
issue notice of de-registration. 
 
KHRC intends to institute a suit against
the NGO Board's illegal and irregular actions.
 
The
Observatory would like to recall that the Board's decision to potentially
de-register the KHRC is part of a larger campaign of repression against
independent civil society organisations. Over the last two years, the NGO Board
has drafted four sets of harmful amendments to the Public Benefits Act (PBO Act
2013). The harsher amendments have sought to cap foreign funding to 15%,
undermine self-regulation and impose excessive national executive regulation.
In December 2014, the Bureau de-registered 540 organisations. Two weeks later,
the Bureau reinstated 179 organisations after they proved they were in full
compliance. The opportunity of the PBO Taskforce to create a consensus on the
amendments to the PBO Act was squandered by the NGO Coordination Bureau in
April. In June 2015, the Government froze the accounts of Haki Africa and
MUHURI, two local human rights organisations, on the recommendation of the NGO
Board[1].
Less than two months later, the High Court found that the two organisations had
no case to answer[2].
On November 12, 2015, the court lifted the ban on the accounts.
 
In
this context, the Observatory remains concerned about the target of human
rights groups, especially those who call for accountability for Kenya’s
2007-2008 post-election violence and those documenting security forces abuses.
 
The
Observatory strongly condemns the harassment of KHRC and other NGOs in Kenya,
which seems to merely aim at preventing them from carrying out their legitimate
human rights work. More generally, the Observatory reiterates its concerns
regarding the shrinking space imposed by the Government to the civil society in
Kenya.
 
Actions
requested:
 
Please write to the authorities of Kenya, urging
them to:
 
i. Guarantee
in all circumstances the physical and psychological security and integrity of
the members of the KHRC, as well as of all human rights defenders in Kenya;
 
ii. Put an end to any kind of harassment –
including at the administrative level – against the KHRC and their members, as
well as against all human rights organisations in Kenya so that they are able
to carry out their work without any hindrances;
 
iii. Acknowledge the important role played by
civil society in promoting tolerance in the struggle against violent extremism
and ensure an enabling environment in which human rights defenders and civil
society can operate free from hindrance and insecurity;
 
iv. Comply with all the provisions of the United
Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, in particular with its:
- Article 1, which provides that
“everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to
promote and to strive for the protection and realization of human rights and
fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”;
- Article 12.2 , which provides that
“the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the
competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others,
against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse
discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his
or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present
Declaration”;
 
v. More generally, ensure in all
circumstances the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in
accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with
international and regional human rights instruments ratified by Kenya.
