Brief description of the situation:The Observatory has been informed by the Philippine Alliance of Human Rights Advocates (PAHRA) about the extra-judicial execution of Mr. Ka Eric, alias Enrico Cabanit, Secretary General of Pambansang Ugnayan ng mga Nagsasariling Lokal na Organisasyon sa Kanayunan (National Coordination of Local Autonomous Rural People’s Organisations - UNORKA), a non-governmental organisation campaigning for land reform.  According to the information received, on April 24, 2006, Mr. Ka Eric was shot dead at around 6:10 pm at the Panabo Public Market by two unidentified assassins. He sustained four gunshot wounds in the head and died on the spot. His daughter was also seriously wounded and is said to be in critical condition at Tagum General Hospital.    Mr. Ka Eric had reportedly just had a meeting with officials of the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR), along with other peasants, at UNORKA-Mindanao office, just 500 meters away from the place of incident. They were asking that the lands owned by the family Floirendo, in Davao Penal Colony (DAPECOL), be included in the list of lands under the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Programme (CARP). Indeed, under the CARP, landowners are required to have their land distributed to beneficiaries.  According to the information received, Mr. Ka Eric consistently called for land reform and distribution of lands to poor farmers who are beneficiaries of CARP, and was among the complainants against present and past government officials for corrupt practices. His organisation has actively engaged in the expulsion of two past DAR secretaries for their anti-peasant and anti-reform policies.  The Observatory strongly condemns the assassination of Mr. Ka Eric, which adds up to the long list of extra-judicial executions of human rights defenders in the Philippines, in particular those acting in favour of economic, social and trade unions rights.
