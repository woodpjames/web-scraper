The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), has received new information and requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in the People’s Republic of China (PRC).
New information:
The Observatory has been informed by China Human Rights Defenders and Human Rights in China (HRIC) about the critical health condition of Mr. Hu Jia, an HIV/AIDS activist, co-founder and former Director of the Beijing Aizhixing Institute for Health Education[1] as well as winner of the 2008 Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, who is currently detained at the Beijing City Prison Hospital.
According to the information received, in the morning of March 30, 2010, Mr. Hu Jia underwent an examination in the prison hospital to determine if he has liver cancer as a previous examination had revealed a three-centimetres growth on his liver. Mr. Hu Jia has reportedly remained in the prison hospital for treatment since that date. However, as of issuing this urgent appeal, Mr. Hu Jia had not been allowed to see his family, and doctors had still not informed his relatives on the results of the latest round of tests, although they had assured that they would do so by April 2, 2010.
According to Mr. Hu’s wife, Mrs. Zeng Jinyan, the health of Mr. Hu, diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver in 2006, has steadily deteriorated in the framework of his arbitrary detention since December 27, 2007 (See background information). Since his transfer from the Chaobai prison to the Beijing Municipal Prison in October 2008, Mr. Hu has lost weight and struggled with stomach ailments, persistent colds, polypoid lesions of the gallbladder, portal hypertension and gallstones in addition to the worsening of his cirrhosis, due to the poor nutrition and bad conditions of detention.
Chinese regulations governing the release of prisoners on medical parole state that those with serious, life-threatening diseases are eligible for medical parole at any time, and those who suffer from chronic diseases which have worsened despite long-term treatment are eligible after serving at least one-third of their sentence. Mr. Hu Jia meets both of these conditions.
Accordingly, on April 7, 2010, Mrs. Zeng Jinyan has applied to prison officials in Beijing for Mr. Hu’s release on medical parole. However, the prison authorities told Mr. Hu's lawyer that the medical parole is unlikely to be granted as his case involved “other considerations” beyond his medical condition.
The Observatory expresses its deep concern about Mr. Hu Jia’s health and ongoing arbitrary detention, which seem to merely aim at sanctioning his human rights activities, and urges the Chinese authorities to immediately release Mr. Hu Jia and to guarantee his access to adequate and appropriate medical care.
Background information:
On December 27, 2007, about 20 policemen came to Mr. Hu Jia’s home, surrounded his wife and child as well as his wife’s grandmother, who was visiting, cut off the telephone line and internet connection, confiscated their mobile phones and then took Mr. Hu Jia away, on suspicion of “inciting subversion of state power”.
On April 3, 2008, Mr. Hu Jia was sentenced to three years and six months’ imprisonment and one year of political rights deprivation for “inciting subversion of state power” by the Beijing Municipal No. 1 Intermediate People’s Court. The court’s only ground for convicting Mr. Hu Jia consisted of his articles, press interviews, personal letters, testimony in European Parliament by Internet, and the open letter he signed: “The Real China Before the Olympics”, which demanded to end the pre-Olympics human rights abuses.
Mr. Hu Jia, who, according to the law, had ten days from his sentencing to appeal this decision, was prevented to receive visits from his lawyers in this period of time, in order to discuss the details of a possible appeal. Subsequently, Mr. Hu’s legal team was not able to form any appeal.
Since his sentencing, his lawyers have rarely been allowed to visit him. Whenever his family or lawyers confront the prison authorities, the latter always cite “internal regulations” as justifications for denying requests to visit him. In addition, Mr. Hu Jia’s health condition has been seriously deteriorating as the Beijing Public Security Bureau (PSB) has repeatedly refused to supply Mr. Hu with all the medication he needs and to deliver him the medication brought by his relatives to the detention centre.
On October 23, 2008, the European Parliament attributed the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought to Mr. Hu Jia.
On April 9, 2010, the Chairwoman of Subcommittee on Human Rights Ms. Heidi Hautala called for Mr. Hu Jia's release on medical parole[2].
Actions requested:
Please write to the authorities in the People’s Republic of China, urging them to:

 Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, its article 9, which states that “[...] everyone has the right, individually or in association with others, to benefit from an effective remedy and to be protected in the event of the violation of those rights” and its Article 12.2, which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”;
