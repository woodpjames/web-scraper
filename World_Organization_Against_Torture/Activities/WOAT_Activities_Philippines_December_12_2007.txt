This has resulted in many illicit mining activities and increased opposition of the populations directly concerned.     To prevent further violence and killings, the International Secretariat of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) calls on the Government of the Philippines to halt mining activities on Sibuyan Island and to establish an independent commission to review respect for the rights of the local population, to seek ways to protect their rights in the future. OMCT recommends calling on the UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people to assist the independent commission.   OMCT also calls on mining corporations and their partners and owners to carry out their activities in strict respect for the human rights - economic, civil, cultural, political and social - of the populations affected by their activities and establish control mechanisms that ensure the respect for those rights and ongoing dialogue with the populations concerned.    OMCT further calls on the European Union to ensure human rights are respected in the implementation of the 2007-2013 EU-Philippines Country Strategy Paper.    This report has been prepared in close consultation with Philippine non-governmental organisations.
