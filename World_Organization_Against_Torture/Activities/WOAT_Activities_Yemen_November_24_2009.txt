Description of the situation: The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources of numerous acts of harassment against the Sister's Arab Forum for Human Rights (SAF) and its Chairperson, Ms. Amal Basha. According to the information received, in the evening of November 22, 2009, the SAF offices in Sana'a were broken in and entered into. After breaking the windows, individuals entered into the offices. Premises and archives were searched, but nothing was stolen, not even valuable electronic devices. A complaint was filed at the police headquarters and an investigation is currently going on. Furthermore, on November 20 and 21, 2009, Ms. Amal Basha received approximately fifty anonymous phone calls from the same number, all immediately hanged up by the interlocutor, except one in which the interlocutor said he was working for the investigation department and used an intimidating tone. Recently, Ms. Amal Basha was also attacked by a young man as she was leaving the tribunal after observing a court hearing. Using the method used by fundamentalists to attack uncovered women, the young man sprayed water to her head and face with a syringe, thereby attempting to frighten and intimidate her. Moreover, on November 17, 2009, the brakes of Ms. Amal Basha's car would have been deliberately sabotaged. These acts of harassment follow the publication by SAF on October 12, 2009 of a report on torture in Yemen, as well as a joint briefing note in September 2009 on the human rights situation to the United Nations (UN) Human Rights Council in the framework of the Universal Periodic Review of the Yemen in September 2009. The original copy of a film produced by SAF on the discrimination faced by the Akhdam[1] was also confiscated three months ago by the national security services at the airport in Sana'a, who alleged that it was tarnishing the image of Yemen abroad. Finally, SAF had recently carried out several activities in the framework of its campaign for peace in Saada. The Observatory condemns those acts, which seem to be aimed at hindering and sanctioning the human rights activities of SAF and Ms. Basha, and therefore contravenes the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 9, 1998. Actions requested: Please write to the Yemeni authorities and ask them to:   Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Ms. Amal Basha as well as of all members of the Sister's Arab Forum for Human Rights ; Carry out a prompt, effective, thorough, independent and impartial investigation into the above-mentioned events, the result of which must be made public, in order to bring all those responsible before a competent, independent and impartial tribunal and apply penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions as provided by law;  Put an end to all acts of harassment against Ms. Amal Basha, the members of the Sister's Arab Forum for Human Rights as well as all human rights defenders in the Republic of Yemen;  Conform in any circumstances with the provisions of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted on December 9, 1998 by the United Nations General Assembly, in particular its article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually or in association with others, to promote the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, and its article 12.2 which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”;  Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by the Republic of Yemen.
