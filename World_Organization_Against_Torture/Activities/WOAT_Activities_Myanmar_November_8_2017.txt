On November 1, 2017, he died of the injuries sustained in the attack at Mandalay hospital.On October 28, 2017, a village administrator from Iwine Parhe village had informed Mr. Htay Aung, along with fellow FNPU members, that there would be an inspection of confiscated land in the area.[2] On November 1, 2017, Mr. Htay Aung went to the area of land where the inspection was to take place in Iwine Parhe village and was repeatedly punched and beaten with bamboo sticks by about 20 villagers.On October 28, 2017, three people were arrested and detained for questioning at Nawnghkio police station in connection with Mr. Htay Aung’s murder but were released on the same day. A police investigation was ongoing at the time of publication of this Urgent Appeal.According to FNPU, the disputed land originally belonged to resident of Lwine Parhe village. In 1989-90, it was confiscated by a Korean Company and later by government authorities and the Tatmadaw (Burma army). Later, the disputed land was re-allocated to Palaung ethnic villagers from Palaung Gone village who had moved to the area. Mr. Htay Aung was helping Lwine Parhe villagers to seek the return of the land from the Palaung Gone villagers.Earlier in October, Mr. Htay Aung had sent a letter to the Central Review Committee on Confiscated Farmlands and Other Lands, the National Assembly, the People’s Assembly, and the Shan State Chief Minister, calling on them to return the confiscated land to the original owners.The Observatory condemns in the strongest terms the murder of Mr. Htay Aung and urges the Burmese authorities to carry out a thorough, impartial, and transparent investigation into Mr. Htay Aung’s murder without undue delay and to hold those responsible accountable.The Observatory expresses its concern over ongoing deadly attacks against human rights defenders, including land rights defenders, in Burma.[3] The Observatory reiterates its call for the authorities to adopt effective measures to ensure the protection of human rights defenders in the country.Actions requested:Please write to the Burmese authorities asking them to:i. Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of all human rights defenders in Burma;ii. Carry out an immediate, thorough, impartial, and transparent investigation into the murder of Mr. Htay Aung in order to identify all those responsible, bring them before an independent tribunal, and sanction them as provided by the law;iii.
