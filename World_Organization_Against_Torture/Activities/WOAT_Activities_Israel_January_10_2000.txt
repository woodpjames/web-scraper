Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT has received information from reliable sources concerning the arrest and detention by Israeli military forces of 16 Palestinian minors, ranging from 12 to 16 years of age, accused of throwing stones.  According to the information received, large numbers of Israeli military forces surrounded the houses of the children in the middle of the night and forcefully demanded that the children be handed over to them.  The one exception was a 14-year-old who was arrested around 4pm on 22 December, again with strong military presence, shortly before the Iftar dinner, marking the end of Muslim fasting for the day.    The arrested are the following:  Name					D.O.B.		Place		Date of Arrest      1.   Imad Abu Ayyash		29.8.85	Jalazon 	27.12.99 2.   Ibrahim Qattawi			1986		Jalazon	25.12.99	Released 3.

Mohammad Sharif		1986		Beitunia	1.1.00		Released   According to the Defence for Children International/Palestine Section’s Attorney Khaled Quzmar, who visited all of the detained, the children were taken for interrogation at Beit El Detention Center, near Ramallah, immediately following their arrest, without allowing the children to sleep.  During interrogation, it was reported that two of the children were beaten and the others were threatened with physical abuse, and confessions were extracted from the arrested children.   Since the time of the arrests, four of the minors (ages between 12 and 13) have been released, two of whom were forced to pay a 2000 shekel fine (~US$ 450), and two of whom the Legal Adviser refused to accept their arrest.  The remaining children were brought before the military court at Beit El, where the military judge extended the periods of detention until 22 February 2000.  Given the lengthy period of the extension, DCI/PS's Attorney has filed an appeal protesting the decision.  A court date has been set for 18 January to hear the appeal.  In the meantime, the minors remain in Beit El Detention Center.  Actions requested  Please write to the Israeli authorities urging them to:  i.	guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of all remaining detainees at all times and ensure immediate access to medical care, particularly that of those children reportedly beaten;  ii.	order an immediate investigation into the circumstances of the arrest of the above-mentioned persons and all allegations of ill-treatment and threats, and bring those responsible to justice;  iii.	order the immediate release of all children if they are being held in detention without any valid charges or, in the event that there is, bring them immediately before a competent and impartial tribunal and guarantee their full procedural rights as well as their right to legal counsel at all times, in conformity with the international human rights standards;  iv.	guarantee all human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards, particularly the Convention on the Rights of the Child (Article 37), ratified by Israel.
