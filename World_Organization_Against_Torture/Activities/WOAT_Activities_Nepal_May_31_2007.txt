Brief description of the situation: The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about threats against Mr. Jitman Basnet, a lawyer, a journalist and a human rights activist in Nepal. According to the information received, on May 21, 2007, Mr. Basnet received an anonymous call at around 6.15 pm, from a public telephone booth in Swayambhu, Kathmandu, in which he was threatened to “bear the results” of his engagement in the struggle against impunity in Nepal. Indeed, Mr. Basnet has been working in favour of conflict victims for several years. In September 2006, he filed a writ of mandamus before the Supreme Court, demanding that a High Level Committee be formed to investigate into human rights violations that took place during the recent conflicts in Nepal, as well as into the cases of disappearances that UN Office of High Commissioner for Human Rights-Nepal (OHCHR-Nepal) submitted to the government in May 2005. He also accused King Gyanendra and army officials for supplying false information to the Supreme Court. King Gyanendra is cited in these cases as he was the Chief of the Royal Nepal Army and therefore bears command responsibility. In March 2007, Mr. Basnet also published a book entitled 258 Dark Days, with the help of Advocacy Forum Nepal and the Asian Human Rights Commission (AHRC), relating to his prolonged custody in Bhairabnath Battalion’s facilities. Indeed, the book also covers the stories of many other detainees who were tortured, raped, killed and/or disappeared at the hands of the Bhairabnath Barracks’ personnel, giving an insight into Nepal’s turbulent and bloody recent past, concerning which impunity still prevails. On February 4, 2004, Mr. Basnet was arrested by members of the Bhairabnath Army Battalion, Kathmandu, and then arbitrarily detained incommunicado for 258 days and tortured[1]. After his release, Mr. Basnet was repeatedly harassed by members of the army and, as a result, finally left Kathmandu. He spent some 17 months in India before returning to Nepal. The Observatory expresses its deep concern on the intimidation and threats to which Mr. Basnet has been subjected to. Even though the situation of human rights defenders in Nepal seems to have improved recently, this case of intimidation may announce further attacks on human rights defenders in the country. Actions required: Please write to the Nepalese authorities urging them to:  Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Jitman Basnet; Conduct a fair, impartial and independent inquiry into the events above-mentioned, in order to bring the authors to justice and pronounce sentences proportional to the gravity of their crimes; Put an end to any act of harassment and threat against Mr. Jitman Basnet  as well as against all human rights defenders in the country; Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels” and article 12.2, which states that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”; Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by Nepal.
