Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Palestinian Human Rights Monitoring Group (PHRMG), a member of the OMCT network, of the sentencing to six months of administrative detention of Mr. Abed Rahman al-Ahmar, a PHRMG field researcher who had been arrested on 24th May 2001.  According to the information received, on July 15th 2001, an Israeli Military Judge, Adrian Agasi, issued a six-month administrative detention order against Abed al-Ahmar, on the basis of secret evidence submitted by the Israeli General Security Services (GSS). The hearing was held at the Megiddo detention center and the evidence presented by Mr. Al-Ahmar’s lawyers was reportedly not considered by the Judge.  Mr. al-Ahmar was arrested by Israeli security forces on May 24th 2001 and transferred to the Gush Etzion military detention center. On 30th May his detention was extended by 20 days, without the presence or knowledge of his lawyers, and he was transferred to the Russian Compound detention center in Jerusalem. Attorney Yossi Schwartz, who represented Mr. al-Ahmar, filed an appeal against this extension on June 4th 2001. The appeal was rejected on June 5th by the Military Court of Appeals in Beit El, West Bank.  Following allegations that during his detention Mr al-Ahmar may have been submitted to torture, in particular to the “shabeh” torture method, which consists of being shackled in tight handcuffs to a slanting chair for the entire day  (outlawed by the Israeli Supreme Court on September 6th 1999), Attorney Pacheco, acting for the PHRMG, and the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel (PCATI), a member of the OMCT network, filed a petition with the High Court against the torture on 11th June 2001. The petition was rejected in a hearing on June 12th, 2001, for lack of evidence.  Another extension of his detention was decided on June 18th 2001 for 15 days. The appeal filed by Mr. al-Ahmar’s lawyers was rejected on June 22nd 2001.  On July 2nd 2001, the latest extension came to an end, and the Military Commander ordered a six-month administrative detention, saving the GSS from having to present new evidence against him. Mr. al-Ahmar was then immediately transferred to the Meggido Detention Center.  According to the information received, Mr. al-Ahmar has already been held in administrative detention for two and a half years, prior to his release in 1998, and a procedure on allegations of torture that he initiated at that time is still pending against the GSS.  The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned for his physical and psychological integrity, taking into account his previous detention, and fears that he may be subjected to torture or other forms of ill-treatment.  Action requested  Please write to the authorities in Israel urging them to:  1.	take all necessary measures to guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Al-Ahmar; 2.	order his immediate release in the absence of valid legal charges or, if such charges exist, bring him before an impartial and competent tribunal and guarantee his procedural rights at all times; 3.	guarantee an immediate investigation into his alleged torture in detention, identify those responsible, bring them before a civil competent and impartial tribunal and apply the penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions provided by law; 4.	guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
