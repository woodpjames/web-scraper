The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint 
programme of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and FIDH, 
received new information and requests your urgent intervention in the 
following situation in Thailand.
 
New Information:
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the arbitrary 
detention and subsequent release of Neo Democracy Movement (NDM)[1]activists Messrs.  
Pakorn Areekul, Anucha Rungmorakot, and  
Anan Loket[2]
, university student activist Mr. Phanuwat 
Songsawadchai, and Prachatai journalist Mr. Taweesak 
Kerdpoka for alleged violation of Article 61 of the Referendum 
Act[3].
 
According to the information received, on July 11, 2016, the Ratchaburi 
Provincial Court granted police permission to detain the above-mentioned 
activists and journalist. However, at around 4:30pm, all five were released, 
with bail set at 140,000 Thai baht (approx. 3,590 Euro) each.
 
On July 10, 2016, at around 11:30am, officers from the Ban Pong police 
station in Ratchaburi province detained the four activists and the Prachatai 
reporter after they searched Mr. Pakorn’s pick-up truck and found 
booklets that criticized Thailand’s draft constitution. The three NDM 
activists had travelled to the Ban Pong police station to show support for 
18 activists who had been summoned to answer charges of violating the Head 
of the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO)no. 3/2558. The charges 
stemmed from the 18 activists’ participation in a ceremony to open 
referendum-monitoring centers in the province on June 16, 2016.Mr. Taweesak 
was accompanying the three NDM activists to report on their activity.Mr. 
Phanuwat, who had attended the June 16 ceremony, was arrested at his home on 
the same day at 8:20pm.
 
The Observatory recalls that this is not the first time that NDM members 
have been arbitrarily arrested and detained as a result of the legitimate 
exercise of their right to freedom of expression, association and assembly[4].
 
The Observatory welcomes the release of the four above-mentioned activists 
and the Prachatai journalist but strongly condemns their arbitrary arrest, 
detention, and judicial harassment, which only aim at sanctioning their 
legitimate human rights activities.
 
Moreover, the Observatory calls on the Thai authorities to drop all 
charges against the five, amend Article 61 of the Referendum Act,and repeal 
the Head of the NCPO Order no. 3/2558, as their provisions do not comply 
with international human rights conventions ratified by Thailand, especially 
with respect to the right to freedom of expression and the right to freedom 
of peaceful assembly.
 
Until all charges are dropped, the Observatory urges the Thai authorities 
to ensure all judicial proceedings against the activistsare carried out in 
full compliance with their right to a fair trial, as protected under 
international law. Furthermore, the Observatory urges the Thai authorities 
to grant adequate reparations to human rights defenders who have been 
arbitrarily detained.
 
Background Information: 
 
On June 23, 2016, at around 5:30pm, 13 activists from the Neo Democracy 
Movement (NDM), namely Messrs. Rangsiman Rome[5],Korakoch 
Saengyenpan, Anan Loket, Thirayut  
Napnaram, Rackchart Wong-arthichart, Yuttana Dasri 
,Worawut Butmat, Somsakol Thongsuksai,Nantapong 
Panmat and MissesTueanjai Waengkham, Pimai Ratwongsa, 
Konchanok Tanakhun,andPhanthip Saengathit, were 
arrested by military personnel at the market of Kan Keha Bang Phli community 
on the eastern outskirts of Bangkok in Samut Prakan province, while handing 
out leaflets that urged voters to reject the draft constitution in a 
referendum to be held on August 7, 2016.
 
All 13 activists were apprehended and taken to the Bang Sao Thong police 
station and their campaign material was confiscated. They were held in 
police custody overnight and were all charged with violating the Head of the 
National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO) Order no. 3/2558[6], which bans gatherings of five or more 
people, and Article 61 of the 2016 Constitutional Referendum Act, which bans 
the dissemination of “false information” about the draft charter 
with the aim of influencing voters. If found guilty, all 13 could each face 
up to 10 years’ imprisonment, a fine of up to 200,000 Baht (approx. 
5,125 Euro), and have their right to vote revoked by a court for up to 10 
years under the Referendum Act.
 
On June 24, 2016, the 13 activists were brought to their pre-trial remand 
hearing at the Bangkok Military Court, where the police asked the court to 
have them remanded for 12 days in order to provide sufficient time to 
conduct the investigation, as well as for fear of repetition of the crime. 
The court dismissed the motion filed by the defendants’ attorney to 
object to the police request and approved the pre-trial remand.
 
Six of the activists were released on a bail of 50,000 Baht (approx. 1,280 
Euro) each, under the condition that they do “not get involved with 
any act aimed to instigate, disrupt public order, persuade, compel people to 
rise up by any means possible in order to make possible any public assembly 
which may bring about public disorder or cause any harm or infringement on 
peace, order or the moral high ground of the people or any act which may 
induce people to commit a legal offence”.
 
The other seven activists did not submit bail requests, arguing that they 
had done nothing wrong and that they would not accept conditions for their 
release. They were remanded in custody at the Bangkok Remand Prison until 
July 5, 2016, when the defendants’ attorney was expected to file 
another motion to object to a further remand.
 
On July 6 at around 8:30am, the Department of Corrections released six of 
the seven democracy activists, after on July 5, 2016, at approximately 
3:15pm, the Bangkok Military Court rejected apolice request to extend the 
detention of the seven activists for another 12 days.
 
Mr. Korakoch Saengyenpan was not released and was transported to the 
Thonburi police station because of previous charges he faced in connection 
with another case against 11 pro-democracy activists who undertook an 
“advocacy trip” to demand the opening of an investigation 
into alleged corruption in the construction of 
the military-sponsored Rajabhakti Park in Prachuab Kirikhan province in 
December 2015[7].
 
It was reported that the majority of the detainees lost weight during the 
span of their custody. Most notably, Mr. Rangsiman Rome was said to have 
lost at least 10kg during his 12-day detention.
 
Mr. Korakoch was released on bail on July 6, 2016, at about 
4:30pm.
