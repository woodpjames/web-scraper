execution/ Alleged torture and ill-treatment/ Lack of a proper investigation
The International
Secretariat of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) requestsyour
URGENT intervention in
the following situation in India/ West Bengal.
Brief description of the situation
The International Secretariat of OMCT has been
informed by Banglar Manabadhikar
Suraksha Mancha (MASUM), a member of OMCT SOS-Torture Network, about the extrajudicial
execution of Mr. Saidul Mondal, about 28 years old from Jaykrishnapur
village, in Murshidabad district, by members of the Border Security Force
(BSF). To date, no effective investigation has been reportedly carried out. 
According to the information received, on 17
April 2011, at
about 4:30 am,
Mr. Saidul Mondal was nearby the Char Mourasi BSF Camp when he was apprehended
by about five members of the BSF, alleged to be from the Charmairasi BSF Border
Out Post (BOP) camp. The BSF then allegedly started to beat him with bamboo
sticks and the bayonet of their service rifles. Mr. Saidul Mondal sustained
severe injuries and died a short time later. Several individuals reportedly
witnessed the scene. 
According to the same information received, the
Raninagar police subsequently registered one unnatural death case at Raninagar
Police Station (U.D. Case no. 8/2011) and a post mortem examination (PME) on
Mr. Saidul Mondal’s body was reportedly carried out at Lalbagh Sub-Divisional
Hospital, on 18 April 2011. The conclusions of the PME remain unknown and, to
date, no effective investigation has been carried out into the circumstances of
the death of Mr. Saidul Mondal. The alleged perpetrators and the witnesses to
the scene have reportedly never been interrogated by the police. 
OMCT recalls that the Indian authorities have to fulfil their
obligations under the Indian Constitution[1]
and under international human rights law to protect the right to life. OMCT is
also deeply concerned by the delays in initiating an effective investigation
into the circumstances surrounding the killing of Mr. Saidul Mondal.
Accordingly, OMCT calls on the competent authorities to ensure that the
investigation is carried out promptly, effectively, thoroughly, independently and impartially, in
accordance with international human rights standards, inter alia, with the UN Principle on the Effective Prevention and
Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions, the result of
which must be made public, in orderto
bring those responsible before a competent, independent and impartial tribunal
and apply penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions as provided by law.
