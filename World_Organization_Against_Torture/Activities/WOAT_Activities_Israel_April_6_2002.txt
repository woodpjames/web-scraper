Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Palestinian Society for the Protection of Human Rights and the Environment (LAW), a member of the OMCT network, that 19-year old Palestinian, Baker Naji Abdulkader Allan, was allegedly subjected to torture by the Israeli Border Police, on June 1st, 2002.  According to the information received, Mr. Allan, who works at a gas company delivering gas barrels in Beit Hanina al-Foukat, set off for work at 7 a.m., on June 1st 2002.  Mr. Allan took a small dirt road near the old Ram check point in order to bypass the checkpoint in Beit Hanina. According to the report, while Mr. Allan was walking on the road, a military jeep arrived, several policemen got out of the vehicle and started to chase the people on the road. Mr. Allan began to run but was caught by the officers on a small hill behind the Nusseihbeh buildings.  According to the information received, Mr. Allan was beaten for several hours by the border policemen, who proceeded to scar Mr. Allan with a razor blade, by cutting the Star of David into his left arm, an ‘X’ into his right cheek and also scarring his forehead.  According to the report, when the policemen saw other Palestinians on the dirt road they left Mr. Allan and started chasing the others. Mr. Allan was arbitrarily detained for several hours, during that time, he was not asked for his identity card, nor his name.    According to the information received, Mr. Allan managed to run home to his brother Samir who took him to the Augusta Victoria Hospital to treat his injuries.  The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned that Baker Naji Abdulkader was subjected to ill-treatment and torture, and was subsequently arbitrarily detained for several hours.  OMCT fears that Mr. Allan will not be granted adequate reparation and that the perpetrators of this attack will continue to enjoy impunity.
