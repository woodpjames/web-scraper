New information: The Observatory has been informed by the Iranian League for the Defence of Human Rights (LDDHI) of the release on high bail of Ms. Raheleh Asgarizadeh and Ms. Nasim Khosravi, two members of the One Million Signatures Petition Campaign, which seeks to put pressure on the Iranian legislators in order to withdraw provisions that have adverse effects on women’s human rights. According to the information received, on February 26, 2008, Ms. Raheleh Asgarizadeh and Ms. Nasim Khosravi were released on high bail after the amount was reduced to 10 million Tomans each (roughly $11,000) and was paid to the Revolutionary Courts by their family members. The Observatory welcomes the release on bail of Ms. Asgarizadeh and Ms. Khosravi, and thanks all the persons, institutions and organisations who intervened in their favour. However, the Observatory recalls that Ms. Asgarizadeh and Ms. Khosravi remain charged with “propaganda against the State”, and expresses its deep concern about the ongoing harsh repression of the Iranian authorities against human rights defenders, in particular women’s rights activists involved in the One Million Signatures Campaign. To that extent, the Observatory recalls that more than a hundred of women’s rights activists have been arrested, interrogated, or sentenced in the past two years and that the government has raised over one million Euros by imprisoning the activists and releasing them on high bail. The Observatory further wishes to insist on the fact that Iran had committed to “uphold the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights”[1] by presenting its candidacy to the Human Rights Council 2006 election and had insisted in this regard on the fact that the country had “continuously put great efforts into safeguarding the status and inherent dignity of the human person as well as the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms”[2]. In order to ensure the continuation of these efforts, the Observatory urges the Islamic Republic of Iran to conform with international human rights standards. Background information: On February 14, 2008, Ms. Asgarizadeh and Ms. Khosravi were arrested in Tehran’s Daneshjoo Park, while collecting signatures in support of the Campaign’s petition. After their arrest, they were taken to Tehran’s police station n°129 (Jaami) and then transferred to the security police station number 8 for interrogation. Upon completion of their interrogation, they were transferred to the Vozara detention centre. On the morning of February 15, 2008, Ms. Asgarizadeh and Ms. Khosravi were taken to the Revolutionary Court, where they were charged with “propaganda against the State”. A bail of $22,000 was set for their release, but the two were transferred to Evin prison.
