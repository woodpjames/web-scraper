The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint
partnership of FIDH and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), has
received new information and requests your urgent intervention in the following
situation in Iran.
 
New information:
 
The Observatory has been informed by the League for the Defence of Human
Rights in Iran (LDDHI) about the sentencing of Mr. Reza Khandan, a human rights defender known for having raised
concerns on Facebook about human rights violations in Iran, including the
imprisonment of human rights defenders and the prosecution of women who have
campaigned against the imposition of the hijab. Mr. Khandan also campaigned for
the release of his wife, Ms. Nasrin
Sotoudeh, one of Iran’s most prominent human rights lawyers, who was
arrested on June 13, 2018[1].
 
According to the information received, on January 22,
2019, Mr. Khandan’s lawyer was notified that Branch 15 of the Islamic
Revolution Court in Tehran sentenced his client to six years of imprisonment - five years for “gathering and
collusion with intent to commit crimes against national security” (Article 610
of the Islamic Penal Code) and one year for “spreading propaganda against the
system” (Article 500 of the Islamic Penal Code). He was also banned from
“membership in social and political groups and parties, undertaking activities
in cyberspace, the media and the press” and from travelling abroad for two
years. Mr. Khandan will appeal the court’s decision and will remain free
pending the appeal. 
 
The Observatory recalls that Mr. Khandan was arrested on
September 4, 2018, and released on bail on December 23, 2018 (see background
information). The Observatory also recalls that several other human
rights defenders remain in arbitrary detention.
 
The Observatory condemns the
sentencing of Mr. Reza Khandan, which seems to be only aimed at punishing him
for his legitimate human rights activities. The Observatory calls on Iranian
authorities to end all acts of harassment, including at the judicial level,
against Mr. Reza Khandan and all human rights defenders in the country.
 
Background information:

 
On September 4, 2018, Mr. Reza Khandan was
arrested by agents of the Ministry of Intelligence at his home in Tehran and
subsequently taken to Branch 7 of the Prosecutor’s Office in the capital’s Evin
prison. He was detained on charges of “gathering and colluding against national
security”, “spreading propaganda against the system”, and “propagating and
promoting disregard for hijab in the society”. The Prosecutor’s Office ordered
him to deposit bail to the amount of 7,000 million Iranian rials (approximately
55,000 Euros). Mr. Reza Khandan refused to pay the bail, arguing that he
had not committed any offences, and remained detained in Evin prison.
 
On December
23, 2018, Mr. Reza Khandan was provisionally released on a ‘personal guarantee’[2]. This followed a court hearing that was attended by
Mr. Reza Khandan on December 19, 2018, at Branch 15 of the Islamic Revolution
Court in Tehran. During the hearing, the Court agreed to change Mr. Khandan’s
financial bail to a personal guarantee.
