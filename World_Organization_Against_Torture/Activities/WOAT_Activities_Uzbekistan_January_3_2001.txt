Brief description of the situation :  The Observatory has been informed by the Human Rights Society of Uzbekistan (HRSU) that since the organisation was founded on 2nd February 1992, it has been refused registration on 4 occasions by the Ministry of Justice.  Recently, on 7th December 2000, the HRSU wrote to the Khokimiyat (local government) of Tashkent City and submitted a request asking for cooperation in the realization of the 3rd Conference of the HRSU to be held on 22nd December 2000.  The request was to rent a building equipped with the necessary means to host a conference for 60-70 participants.  They were refused permission by the Khokimiyat on the grounds that the organisation had not been registered yet.  The Observatory considers these facts to be a part of a concerted policy on the part of the authorities, to place obstacles in the work of legitimate human rights organisations, and this, in flagrant violation of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders adopted by the UN General Assembly in December 1998.  In particular, the Observatory notes Article 5 which states that, “For the purpose of protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms, everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, at the national and international levels: (a) To meet or assemble peacefully; (b) To form, join and participate in non-governmental organizations, associations or groups…”  Actions requested:  Please write to the Uzbekistan authorities urging them to:  ensure the full freedom of action of human rights defenders in Uzbekistan in conformity with the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9th 1998 in particular Article 1 which states that “Everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”;  generally, guarantee the effective respect of fundamental human rights and freedoms in accordance with the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and international and regional Pacts and Covenants ratified by Uzbekistan.
