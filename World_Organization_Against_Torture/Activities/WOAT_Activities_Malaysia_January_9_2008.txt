Description of the situation: The Observatory has been informed by Suara Rakyat Malaysia (SUARAM) of the death of Mr. Kelesau Naan, head of Penan, a nomadic aboriginal people in Sarawak (Borneo), after more than two months of disappearance. According to the information received, on December 17, 2007, Mr. Kelesau Naan’s skull and body bones were found at Sungai Segita with broken bones of his hand and signs of being hit with sharp object, suggesting possible assault before his death. Mr. Kelesau Naan, who was last seen on October 23, 2007, was one of the main leaders in the blockade campaign against logging of forest in their customary land in the Upper Baram region, where tensions between the indigenous peoples and logging companies have escalated in recent months over logging issues, as well as one of the four plaintiffs and a key witness to a court case on the claim of customary land by Penan in Sarawak that has been awaiting judgment since 1998. The Observatory expresses its deep concern about Mr. Kelesau Naan’s death and fears that it might be the result of his human rights activities in favour of indigenous issues. The Observatory further recalls that Malaysia was elected to the United Nations Human Rights Council in June 2006 for three years and is committed in this regard to “uphold the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights” [See OP9 of the General Assembly Resolution A/RES/60/251]. The Observatory also recalls that according to Article 12.2 of the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 9, 1998, “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”. Actions required: Please write to the Malaysian authorities, urging them to:  i. Order a thorough and impartial investigation into the killing of Mr. Kelesau Naan, in order to identify all those responsible, bring them before a civil competent and impartial tribunal and apply to them the penal sanctions provided by the law; ii. Guarantee that adequate reparation is provided to his relatives iii. Put an end to all acts harassment against human rights defenders in Malaysia;  iv. Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly on December 9, 1998, especially its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, as well as above-mentioned Article 12.2; v. More generally, ensure in all circumstances the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international and regional human rights instruments ratified by Malaysia.
