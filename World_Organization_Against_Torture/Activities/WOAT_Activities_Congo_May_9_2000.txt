Brief description of the facts  The International Secretariat of the OMCT has been informed by ASADHO, a member of the OMCT network, of the arrest of Mr. Emile Omba Lumbu. It is reported that this arrest is related to his detaining information concerning the involvement of the Malta Forrest Company Group in the plundering of natural resources in the Democratic Republic of Congo.   According to the information received, Mr. Omba Lumbu (35), a father of three living at 35 Mobutu Avenue, Kipushi, in the Province of Katanga, was arrested in Kipushi on November 23rd and transferred to Lubumbashi by the services of military information that accuse him of threatening the interests of the State. The information received relates that Mr. Omba Lumbu is currently being detained by the 43rd infantry brigade of Lubumbashi, at the Lido Camp in the Lido Golf district of Lubumbashi. Moreover, Mr. Omba Lumbu’s wife, who is living in hiding with her three children, is reportedly no not able to see her husband.  The International Secretariat of the OMCT is gravely concerned about the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Omba Lumbu and about the treatment to which he might be subjected.   Background of the case  It is reported that Mr. Omba Lumbu was arrested after writing a letter in date of November 13th, 2002 and broadcasted on the air by Voice of America on November 18th, in which he denounced the illicit loading by the Malta Forrest Company Group of uranium-rich copper ores coming from the Lwishuishi and Tumbwe quarries. In his letter, Mr. Omba Lumbu reportedly gave the numbers of the thirteen wagons involved (51254107 ; 51622483 ; 51062178 ; 51311801 ; 51324334 ; 51423243 ; 269728 ZR ; 51687167 ; 51271740 ;  170740 SR ; 51244470 ; 51600560 ; 51223473) and asked the competent authorities to take charge of this affair urgently, because the cargo, meant to be exported by the South, was to leave the town of Kipushi on November 16th, 2002.   Action requested  We request you kindly to write to the authorities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo asking them to:  i.	take all necessary measures to guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Omba Lumbu;  ii.	order his immediate release in the absence of valid legal charges or, if such charges exist, bring him before an impartial and competent tribunal and guarantee his procedural rights at all times;  iii.	ensure respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms all over the country, according to international standards.
