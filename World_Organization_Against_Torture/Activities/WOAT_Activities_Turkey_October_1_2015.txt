URGENT APPEAL - THE OBSERVATORY

TUR 001 / 1015 / OBS 081
Arbitrary detention / 
judicial harassment
Turkey
October 1, 2015
 
The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of
the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation
Against Torture (OMCT) requests your urgent intervention in the following
situation in Turkey. 
 
Description
of the situation:
 
The
Observatory has been informed by the Human Rights Association (İHD) about the
police raid of the offices of its Siirt branch and the arbitrary detentions of İHD’s Siirt branch Chairperson Mr.
Zana Aksu, as well as İHD managers Messrs. Azat Taş and Mirza Ekin.
 
According
to the information received, on September 30, 2015, a
police operation was launched against Kurdish political parties and
non-governmental organizations in Siirt province in southeastern Turkey. The
operations resulted in the arrest of at least ten people, including İHD human rights defenders Messrs. Zana Aksu, Azat Taş and
Mirza Ekin, together
with journalists and members of the Kurdish political party Democratic Regions
Party (DBP). The three human rights defenders were
arrested under the Anti-Terrorism Law (Law 3713 of April 1991) and are currently held in custody at the
anti-terror branch office in Siirt Security Directorate. Moreover, during the
illegal raid, the police confiscated books, reports and other documents, as
well as computers belonging to İHD. 
 
The
Observatory recalls that this new wave of arbitrary arrests and detentions is
part of a wide-range anti-terrorism operation, started in late July 2015 under
the pretext of countering terrorism. However, the operation turned into a
massive crackdown on some civil society organisations depicted as “terrorist
networks”. This campaign has been targeting dozens of peaceful activists who
have been involved in the monitoring of human rights violations resulting from
anti-terrorism operations and advocating for a peaceful resolution of the
Kurdish issue. These peaceful activists include human rights defenders,
particularly IHD members, lawyers, political party
representatives and journalists[1].
 
The
Observatory calls upon the Turkish authorities to put an end to the continuing
harassment of human rights defenders, and particularly İHD
members, and urges the Turkish authorities to immediately and
unconditionally release Messrs. Zana Aksu, Azat Taş and
Mirza Ekin and all
human rights defenders currently held in detention and drop all charges against
them, since their detention is arbitrary as it only aims at sanctioning their
human rights activities.
 
Actions
requested:
 
Please
write to the authorities in Turkey, urging them to:
 
i.
Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Messrs. Zana
Aksu, Azat Taş and Mirza Ekin as well as
all human rights defenders in Turkey;
 
ii.
Release Messrs. Zana Aksu, Azat Taş and
Mirza Ekin immediately
and unconditionally, as well as all other human rights defenders currently in
detention, and drop all charges against them since their detention is arbitrary
as it only aims at curtailing their human rights activities;
 
iii.
Put an end to all acts of harassment, including at the judicial level, against
Messrs. Zana Aksu, Azat Taş and
Mirza Ekin
and other İHD
members and all human rights defenders in Turkey;
 
iv.
Put an end to the crackdown on civil society under the pretext of countering
terrorism and recognise the legitimate role of human rights defenders in line
with Turkey’s international commitments; 

 
v.
Comply with all the provisions of the United Nations Declaration on Human
Rights Defenders, in particular with:
 
-
its Article 1, which provides that “everyone has the right, individually and in
association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and
realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and
international levels”;
 
-
its Article 6(a), which foresees that “everyone has the right, individually and
in association with others, to participate in peaceful activities against
violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms”;
 
-
its Article 12.2, which provides that “the State shall take all necessary
measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone,
individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats,
retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other
arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the
rights referred to in the present Declaration”;
 
vi.
Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms
in accordance with international human rights standards and international
instruments ratified by Turkey.
