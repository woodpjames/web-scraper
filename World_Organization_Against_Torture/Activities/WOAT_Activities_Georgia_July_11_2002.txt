Levan Ramishvili, Director of the Liberty Institute, was particularly targeted. His injuries have resulted in his speach having been temporarily impaired. Three experts from the Council of Europe, present in the offices at the time, witnessed the attack.  According to the information received, the perpetrators acted unmasked and are between 25 and 30 years old. They destroyed equipment, broke furniture and computers, and left the office in disarray.  They seemed to be well-trained.  After the attack, they escaped freely, although the offices are located in the City Centre.  The Observatory expresses its serious concern about this assault which has occurred in the context of a campaign against Human Rights Defenders and discredit of democratic values.  Since the beginning of 2002, there have been several attempts to discredit NGOs and to impose political control on their activities through in particular cutting them from independent sources of financial support. In March 2002, during a government session President Shevardnadze compared NGO activities with terrorist activities and asked for a severe control to be exerted on their finances. He announced that criminal cases would be launched against NGOs if any violations were found. The Minister of Finance, the only member of Government who said this campaign was an ”anti-democratic” move was immediately fired.  Since then, the President has repeated this stance on briefings and press-conferences. High rank officials echoed the President’s position and Levan Mamaladze, an influential government party leader and representative of the President in the Kvemo Kartli region even accused human rights NGO's of "treason " and called for the initiation of criminal cases for "attempted Coup d'Etat". Following these declarations, government run mass-media have launched a campaign of discredit against NGOs.  Action requested:  Please write to the Georgian authorities urging them to:  i.	Order an immediate investigation into this attack in order to identify those responsible, bring them to trial and apply the sanctions provided by law; ii.	Put an end to all forms of harassement against Human Rights Defenders and discredit of Human Rights Defenders; iv.		      Ensure the implementation of the provisions of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders adopted by the UN general Assembly on December 9, 1998 in particular its article 1, which provides that "every person has the right, individually or collectively, to promote the protection and fulfilment of human rights and fundamental liberties at the national and international level" and article 12: “The State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present declaration."; v.		     Guarantee the respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and other international instruments ratified by Georgia.
