New information: The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the end of the judicial proceedings against Ms. Leyla Yunus, Director of the Institute for Peace and Democracy in Azerbaijan. According to the information received, on March 2, 2009, Interior Minister Mr. Ramil Usubov has withdrawn his complaint against Ms. Yunus. The decision of the court not to further consider the case was then read out by Mr. Ragib Gurbanov, Judge of the Yasamal District Court. The Observatory wishes to express its gratitude to all individuals and organizations who have taken action in favour of Ms. Leyla Yunus. Background information: On December 13, 2008, Interior Minister Ramil Usubov accused Ms. Leyla Yunus of slander causing “moral damage” and “attacking the honour and dignity” of the police and himself. The accusations filed by Mr. Usubov on December 13, 2008 were made on the basis of an interview given by Ms. Yunus to the Day.az online news provider on December 3, 2008, in which she pointed out that in the framework of the ongoing trial against Mr. Tavakul Ismailov, one of the alleged kidnappers of two girls in 2005, the latter declared that he had handed over the girls to the head of a local police department, Mr. Mamedmusa Huseynov, for human trafficking purposes, and further asserted that he was tortured while in detention. In the interview, Ms. Yunus denounced the fact that the persons accused by Mr. Ismailov were not called to appear in court by the judge, and asserted more generally that “in most cases the courts in Azerbaijan are issuing illegal and unwarranted decisions in relation to the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms”. In the said interview, Ms. Yunus added that she had followed a prior case of kidnapping, in which several officials of the Interior Ministry had been found guilty and sentenced to a non suspended term of imprisonment, and compared the practices of the Azerbaijani police to those of Mexico and Nigeria. On February 17, the Institute for Peace and Democracy received a letter from the Yasamal District Court, informing them that the Interior Minister’s lawsuit against Ms. Yunus had been scheduled for March 2nd, 2009.
