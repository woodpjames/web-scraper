Re: EU China Summit
 
Dear President Tusk, President Juncker, and High Representative
Mogherini,
Our organizations have documented and advocated solutions to
human rights violations in China for decades.  We write ahead of the June 2, 2017 European
Union (EU)-China Summit in Brussels to urge you to use that occasion to lead
the EU and its member states in demonstrating unified and unambiguous
commitment to promoting human rights in China. 
We note that the summit will be held two days before the 28th
anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. It is an important reminder
of your responsibility to raise in private and public interactions EU and member states’ concerns about
human rights violations in China in all exchanges with your Chinese
counterparts.
Under President Xi Jinping, who will remain in power at least
until 2022, restrictions on human rights, including freedoms of expression, peaceful
assembly, association, and religion or belief, have tightened.  The government has silenced independent civil
society voices, adopted abusive new laws, and carried out a highly politicized “anti-corruption”
campaign that further undermines a judicial system already lacking
independence.  Authorities particularly
in Tibetan areas and the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region remain deeply
hostile to Tibetan and Uyghur communities.
The EU and its member states have raised similar concerns.  For instance, in December
2016, the EU noted China’s
“failure to implement current legal protections and the adoption of laws and
regulations which run contrary to China’s stated commitment to advance the rule of law,” “deterioration
of the situation with respect to freedom of expression and association,” and
its “arrest, detention and conviction of human rights defenders, lawyers and
others exercising rights such as freedom of religion or belief.”  The EU has also expressed support for
independent civil society in China, and made Item 4 statements at the United
Nations Human Rights Council.  
However, while these actions are useful, overall the EU and its
member states have not taken China’s leadership to task for its gross and systematic violations of
human rights.  As China is an EU
Strategic Partner and its second largest trading partner, the EU and its member
states have considerable leverage, yet it has repeatedly failed to use that
leverage to press Chinese authorities to change their policies and
practices.  Even when EU leaders have
spoken out, they tend to be perfunctory: in her April 2017 remarks in Beijing,
for instance EU High Representative Mogherini said, “I conveyed to the State
Councilor the European Union's concern about human rights in China.”
While EU officials are willing to engage in very public,
critical battles with China over steel tariffs, solar panels, or the South
China Seas, most senior EU officials are not willing to engage publicly in such
debates over China’s
use of torture and arbitrary detention, even when those detained were human
rights defenders or EU citizens.   Our
organizations had hoped that the human rights-related steps in the EU’s June
2016 China strategy would inform more robust diplomacy, but that has not
proven to be the case.
In the face of Chinese government obstruction of the bilateral
human rights dialogue, the EU had the opportunity to pursue other meaningful
avenues of engagement—such as a “shadow” dialogue with independent civil
society groups. Senior EU and member state leaders should have used
high-profile occasions, which matter to Chinese leaders, to loudly and publicly
call for the release of baselessly imprisoned individuals like 2010 Nobel Peace
Prize winner Liu Xiaobo, Uyghur
economist Ilham Tohti, and Tibetan
activist Tashi Wangchuk.  By
comparison, the European Parliament has adopted three resolutions with detailed
critiques of human rights abuses.
Over the years, our organizations have met with EU and member
state officials, written briefing papers, and offered extensive guidance on how
to more effectively engage Chinese officials to mitigate human rights
abuses.  Our core premise—that improving
human rights in China is essential for the overall EU-China relationship—has
been accepted, yet few of those recommendations have been pursued in practice. While
the greatest obstacle remains Chinese government intransigence, more than two
decades of hesitant, formulaic EU approaches to human rights have done little
to improve the situation inside China.
If the EU truly seeks human rights improvements in China, the
following steps should be taken, including publicly, by you and your member
state counterparts in advance of and at the summit: 
•     
Identify specific human rights violations that
the Chinese government needs to address as a strategic priority for the EU and
its member states;
•     
Announce the EU and member states’ intention to
suspend and review the bilateral human rights dialogue, as made possible by the
June 2016 China strategy, and the intent to pursue dialogues with good-faith
actors until a meaningful exchange with the Chinese government can be
established; 
•     
Announce the establishment of an accountability
mechanism to ensure that human rights issues or cases are discussed in all
high-level EU-China meetings, and the pursuit of new Foreign Affairs Council
conclusions on human rights in China;
•     
Explain the steps the EU and its member states
will pursue if the Chinese government does not address the concerns raised,
invoking the June 2016 China strategy, which states that the EU “will hold
China to account for its human rights record”;
•     
Reiterating the need to resume dialogue with the
Dalai Lama’s representatives and to release
immediately and unconditionally those detained solely for engaging in peaceful
support for the Dalai Lama
•     
Given the timing of the Summit, calling for full
accountability for the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre
Absent
such steps, we believe that the EU and member states’ approach will do little to
mitigate abuses in China, and increasingly gives those most responsible for
systematic human rights violations a free pass. 
If the EU is unwilling to make use of the “unprecedented level of
maturity” in the EU-China relationship to challenge China effectively on human
rights, it undermines its own ability to promote them anywhere—harming its own
long-term goals with China.
