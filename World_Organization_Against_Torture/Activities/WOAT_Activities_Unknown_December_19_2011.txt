This could not have been achieved without the persistent and tireless commitment and dedication of all actors involved.We particularly acknowledge and thank the Core Group of States that has led the process and the large number of States, from all regions, who have supported the creation of this new Protocol. We also thank all involved for their constructive engagement and congratulate the Chair of the Working Group for his commitment to make this new instrument happen.While the Protocol could have provided a more comprehensive protection to children, we note that it was the result of thorough discussion, co-operation and concession by all and we acknowledge that in addition to individual complaints, it allows other parties to submit information about grave or systematic violations to the Committee.We remain dedicated to making sure that the Protocol is a practical reality for all children and we are committed to resume our campaigning work for its widespread ratification and effective use.We call on all States to initiate national discussions and processes in view of ratification of the new Optional Protocol as soon as possible, and urge them to sign the new Optional Protocol at the official signing ceremony to be held in 2012 to demonstrate their commitment to the protection of child rights.We invite all interested organisations to join our international ratification campaign for the new Optional Protocol.The OMCT together with: CRIN, ECPAT, Global Initiative to End all Corporal Punishment of Children, ICJ, Defence for Children International, Kinder not Hilfe, Plan, the NGO Group for the CRC, Save the Children, World Vision, SOS Children's Villages International, Terres des Hommes International Federation and Youth Empowerment Alliance.Text of the Optional Protocol
