The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in Zimbabwe.
Description of the situation:
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources, including Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights (ZLHR) and the Zimbabwe Human Rights Association (ZimRights), about the arbitrary arrest and judicial harassment against Ms. Ellen Chademana and Mr. Ignatius Muhambi, two employees of Gays and Lesbians of Zimbabwe (GALZ), an association that defends the rights of sexual minorities in Zimbabwe, as well as about the police raid to the house of Mr. Chesterfield Samba, Director of GALZ.
According to the information received, on May 21, 2010, nine police officers from the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) of the Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) entered GALZ offices in Milton Park, Harare, with a warrant to search for dangerous drugs and pornographic material, citing contravention of Section 157 (1) of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act, Chapter 9:23, and Section 32 (1) of the Censorship and Entertainment Control Act, Chapter 10:04. During the raid, the officers arrested Ms. Ellen Chademana, the receptionist, and Mr. Ignatius Muhambi, the accountant, and took them to the Harare Central Police Station. The police also confiscated computers, records and banners from GALZ offices, and purport to have seized pornographic material, which they claim to be holding as evidence for the case.
On May 22, 2010, Ms. Ellen Chademana and Mr. Ignatius Muhambi were denied access to their lawyers. On May 24, 2010, they were formally accused under the charges of "possessing pornographic material" and "undermining the office of the President".
On May 27, 2010, Ms. Ellen Chademana and Mr. Ignatius Muhambi were released on bail with the obligation to check in at the police station every Monday and Friday, and to stay in Harare until the next hearing, which is expected to be held on June 10, 2010.
Furthermore, on May 26, 2010 around 6:00am, five police officers from the ZRP searched Mr. Chesterfield Samba's house at Alexandra Park, in Harare. The officers confiscated Mr. Samba's birth certificate, passport picture, magazines and business cards. Mr. Chesterfield Samba was not present during the raid, but the family members who were at the house report that the police asked them for Mr. Samba’s whereabouts and when he was expected to return.
The Observatory expresses its deepest concern about the above-mentioned acts of harassment against GALZ members, which seem to merely aim at sanctioning their human rights activities, in particular their work in favour of the rights of the sexual minorities in Zimbabwe, and urges the Zimbabwean authorities to put an end to the police harassment against them.
Actions requested:

 Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Ms. Ellen Chademana and Messrs. Ignatius Muhambi and Chesterfield Samba, as well as all GALZ members and all human rights defenders in the country;
