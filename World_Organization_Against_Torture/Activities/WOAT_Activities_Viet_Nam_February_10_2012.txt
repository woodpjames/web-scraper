URGENT APPEAL - THE OBSERVATORY

Enforced disappearance / Fear for physical 
integrity
Viet Nam
February 10, 2012
 
The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint 
programme of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World 
Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), has received new information and requests 
your urgent intervention in the following situation in Viet Nam.
 
New information:
 
The Observatory has been informed by the Vietnam Committee on Human 
Rights (VCHR) about the enforced disappearance while in detention of Mr. 
Nguyen Van Hai (alias Dieu Cay), Founder of the Club of 
Free Journalists and prominent blogger, who has been unaccounted for the past 16 
months while in investigative detention. 
 
According to the information received, Mr. Dieu Cay, who is 
reportedly currently in investigative detention on charges of “propaganda 
against the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam” (Article 88 of the Vietnamese 
Criminal Code), has not had any contact with his family for the past 16 months. 
His wife, Mrs. Duong Thi Tan, has not been able to see him or obtain any 
information about him for the past 16 months, and the police has consistently 
refused to tell her even where he is detained. 
 
On January 17 and 20, 2012, Mrs. Tan was authorised to send food parcels 
through the police to her husband for the Lunar New Year (January 23, 2012). On 
February 1, she went to the Ho Chi Minh City Security Police Investigations 
Department, Phan Dang Luu Street, to ask for a receipt signed by her husband, 
which is routine practice for all prisoners’ families. Lieutenant-colonel Pham 
Van Tan, the officer in charge, would not receive her, and delegated a young 
police officer to take her complaint. When she explained the situation, he went 
inside the office and returned with a receipt. The signature was a mere 
scribble. It was definitely not Dieu Cay’s signature, she said. On February 6, 
2012, she then went to the Ho Chi Minh City People’s Office of Supervision and 
Control (the People’s Procuracy or Vien 
Kiem sat), to ask for news 
of her husband. She had written to 
the Office seven times before finally obtaining an appointment. However, when 
she arrived, they refused to receive her, and told her not to bother coming 
again. 
 
The Observatory is deeply concerned by Mr. Dieu Cay’s enforced 
disappearance, which seems to merely aim at sanctioning his human rights 
activities, and fears that he may have died in prison, or be gravely ill. 
Accordingly, the Observatory calls on Vietnamese authorities to immediately provide 
information on the situation of Mr. Dieu Cay, including his whereabouts and 
current state of health, and to respect his rights to receive visits from, and 
communicate with his family.
 
Background information[1]:
 
The Observatory recalls that Mr. Dieu Cay was arrested in 
April 2008 and sentenced to two and a half years in prison at an unfair trial on 
trumped-up charges of “tax evasion” in September 2008[2]. In fact, he had written articles calling for human rights and 
democratic reforms posted on the Internet, and staged demonstrations during the 
Beijing Olympic games. In 2009, the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary 
Detention declared Mr. Dieu Cay to be a victim of arbitrary detention (Opinion 
1/2009). 
 
Mr. Dieu Cay was due for release on October 19, 
2010 after having completed his prison term. However, his family was then informed that he would remain in 
detention under the new charge of “propaganda against the Socialist 
Republic of Viet Nam”. Since this second charge was pronounced, Mrs. Tan and her family have 
been denied all contacts with him, and both the police and judiciary 
systematically refuse to give any information on his case. In 2011, she 
travelled thirteen times to the Xuan Loc Prison Camp In Dong Nai where he was 
previously detained, but was turned back by the police each time. 

 
On July 5, 2011, Dieu Cay’s wife was told by Lt.-Colonel Dang Hong 
Diep of the Ho Chi Minh City Security Police Investigations Department that Dieu 
Cay had “lost his hand or arm” whilst in detention (the Vietnamese expression is 
“mất tay”, which could mean 
losing either a hand or an arm).
 
The Observatory recalls that this prolonged pre-trial detention is a violation of 
national and international law, including Article 120 of the Vietnamese 
Criminal Procedures Code, which limits pre-trial detention to a maximum of four 
months that may only be extended in “serious cases”. 

 
Actions requested:
Please write to the authorities in Viet Nam urging them 
to:
 
i. Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological 
integrity of Mr. Dieu Cay as well as of all human rights defenders in Viet 
Nam;
 
ii. Take prompt action in order to disclose the whereabouts of 
Mr. Dieu Cay;
 
iii. Release Mr. Dieu Cay immediately and unconditionally as his detention is arbitrary, as it 
seems to merely sanction his human rights activities and is contrary to national 
and international law;
 
iv. Put an end to all acts harassment, including at the judicial level, 
against Mr. Dieu Cay as well as against all human rights defenders in Viet 
Nam;
 
v. Comply with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights 
Defenders, adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 9, 1998, in 
particular:
- its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, 
individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the 
protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the 
national and international levels”, 
- as well as Article 12.2, which provides that “the State shall take 
all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of 
everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, 
threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or 
any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of 
the rights referred to in the present Declaration”;
 
vi. More generally, ensure in all circumstances the respect for human 
rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international and regional 
human rights instruments ratified by Viet Nam.

[2] Dieu Cay was unjustly accused of having failed for ten years to pay 
taxes on premises. Said taxes should have been paid by the owner of the premises 
not Dieu Cay, who was only renting 
them.
