Brief description of the situation: The Observatory has been informed by the Centre for Organisation, Research and Education (CORE) about the assassination of Mr. Konsom Rishikanta, Junior Sub-Editor of the English daily Imphal Free Press, in Manipur, India. According to the information received, on November 17, 2008, at about 4:30 pm at Langol, near the Lamphel Police Station, Imphal West district of Manipur, Mr. Konsom Rishikanta, 25 years old, was shot dead with two bullets on the chest and one on the neck. Mr. Rishikanta was found blind folded, his hands tied behind, and his mouth gagged with a piece of cloth. As of issuing this urgent appeal, the motives and identities of the gunmen remained unknown. However, the Observatory fears that Mr. Rishikanta’s extrajudicial killing might be linked to his human rights activities, as Mr. Rishikanta used to denounce human rights violations committed by both the government and armed opposition groups in Manipur. Furthermore, it is feared that members of State forces may be involved be in Mr. Rishikanta’s extrajudicial killing as the spot where Mr. Rishikanta was found dead is a highly secured area with members of State forces controlling all the three entry points. The Observatory expresses its deep concern about Mr. Konsom Rishikanta’s extrajudicial killing, and urges the Indian authorities to order an immediate, thorough and impartial investigation into his assassination, in order to identify all those responsible, bring them before a competent and impartial tribunal and apply to them the penal sanctions provided by the law. The Observatory also recalls that India was elected as a member of the Human Rights Council in 2007 for three years, and has committed, in this regard, to “uphold the highest standards of promotion and protection of human rights”[1]. Action requested: Please write to the Indian authorities and ask them to:   Take all necessary measures to guarantee, in all circumstances, the physical and psychological integrity of all human rights defenders in India;  Order an immediate, thorough and impartial investigation into Mr. Konsom Rishikanta’s assassination, in order to identify all those responsible, bring them before a competent and impartial tribunal and apply to them the penal sanctions provided by the law;  Guarantee that adequate reparation is provided to his relatives;  Put an end to any act of harassment against all human rights defenders in India;  Comply with the provisions of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 9, 1998, in particular Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually or collectively, to promote the protection and fulfilment of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, as well as Article 12.2, which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually or in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”;  Guarantee the respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and other international human rights instruments ratified by India.
