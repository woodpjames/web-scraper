Brief description of the facts:  The Observatory has been informed by the Human Rights Information and Documentation Center (ISHRG) that the Marneuli regional office of the NGO “For the Protection of Human Rights and Rights of Prisoners of Georgia” was robbed on 19th November 2001.   According to the information received, the members of the organization found broken doors and their printing machine as well as various documents were taken. Although they immediately reported the robbery to the police, there has been no tangible results as of today. It is to be noted that the personal offices in Tbilisi of the head of the organization, Mr. Giorgi Lagidze had also been robbed on 15th May 2001 when various documents were taken.   The Observatory has also been informed of the attack led by Levan Pirveli, Member of Parliament and member of the Citizen’s Union, against Givi Targamadze, member of the NGO “Liberty Institute” on the night of 17th November 2001 at the restaurant “Dzveli Sakhli” in Tbilisi. Mr. Pirveli opened gunfire on Mr. Targamadze, member of the anti-corruption Presidential council that had accused him of corruption. Fortunately, Mr. Targamadze was not hurt.   Besides, the Observatory would also like to recall previous acts of intimidation targeted at human rights organizations. On 4th July 2001, the “Liberty Institute” organization’s offices were robbed and two monitors and three hard disks containing investigation data on corruption were taken. However, the police started investigating only on 21st August. On 6th July 2001, Zviad Mamasakhlisi, a representative of the ISHRG and his friend were attacked by five policemen, who severely beat them first in the street and then in the police offices.   The Observatory is gravely concerned by the multiplication of the acts of intimidation against human rights NGOs, and attacks on the freedom of the press over the last months. This can be illustrated by the police raid that took place on 30th October 2001 in the offices of the independent television channel Rustavi 2, which is very critical of the government’s policy and strongly committed to denouncing the widespread corruption. Also, the murder in July 2001 of its main figure, Géorgyi Sanaya, has remained unsolved.   Actions requested:  Please write to the Georgian authorities to urge them to:  i.	conduct an impartial and thorough investigation on the incidents aforementioned, identify and prosecute the perpetrators of these acts under the existing laws;  ii.	put an end to all forms of harassment of human rights defenders and their organizations, and ensure that they are allowed to carry out their work without obstacles; iii.	ensure the application of the provisions of the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms adopted on 9th December 1998 by the United Nations General Assembly, especially with respect to the protection of the right of all persons, “individually or in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realization of human and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels” (art. 1) as well as the duty of the State “to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration” (art. 12.2); iv.	ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards.
