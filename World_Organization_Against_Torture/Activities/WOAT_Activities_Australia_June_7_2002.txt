The members of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention reportedly expressed their concern at the “dramatic” conditions in the immigration detention centres visited during their mission to Australia. At a press conference prior to their departure, the Working Group highlighted the fact that many detainees suffer from depression as a result of lengthy waiting periods for hearings in asylum matters and the emphasis on discipline within the privately-run detention centres. Concern was also expressed over the system of detaining children, unaccompanied minors and people with disabilities.   In response to the initial findings of the Working Group, the Australian government has declared that visits by “outsiders” such as UN monitoring bodies have exacerbated health problems within the detention centres. The government has also reaffirmed its commitment to the policy of mandatory detention of undocumented asylum seekers.  OMCT is alarmed by the government’s reaction to the preliminary findings of the Working Group and is particularly concerned by its statements in relation to scrutiny of detention facilities by external monitoring bodies. In this regard, the attitude of the Australian government to the Working Group’s visit appears to represent part of a wider trend whereby the government is seeking to limit its accountability for violations of its international human rights obligations and, at the same time, to undermine the international system for the promotion and protection of human rights. This trend is illustrated by the government’s recent opposition to and in some cases obstruction of new and existing human rights instruments at the international level.  OMCT would like to urge the government of Australia to carefully consider, in good faith, the findings of the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and, where necessary, modify its legislation and policy in accordance with the Group’s recommendations. OMCT would also like to call on the Australian government to take urgent measures in order to ensure that the human rights of all persons within its jurisdiction are protected and respected in accordance with international law.
