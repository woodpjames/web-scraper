The BSF reportedly started beating the villagers indiscriminately, using sticks. BSF officers allegedly further physically attacked villagers whom they found at hand. The villagers started fleeing. Several villagers got injured, including fractures, and reported the event to local police station which was recorded as General Diary Entry no. 750/07 dated 15/12/07. According to the same information received, about 25 to 30 injured villagers lodged complaint with the Swarup Nagar Police Station but the police allegedly only registered one. The injured villagers were reportedly sent to Sarapul Rural Hospital by Assistant Sub Inspector Biswait Sarkar of Swarup Nagar Police Station. It is further reported that Mr. Subhashish Bhowmik, the Officer-in-Charge of Swarup Nagar Police Station, stated that he allegedly consulted with Assistant Commander (A.C.) of BSF, Mr. Ram Kumar Tomor, on that issue and also visited the place of incident on 16 January 2008 but no further action was reportedly taken. The International Secretariat of OMCT expresses its deep concerns about the excessive and disproportionnate use of force against villagers of Amudia Majher Para village and the reported lack of proper investigation into this event. OMCT recalls to India that according to article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) to which it is a State party, no one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. OMCT calls on the authorities to order a thorough and impartial investigation into these events in order to identify those responsible, bring them to trial and apply the penal and/or administrative sanctions as provided by law. Further, as an elected member of the United Nations Human Rights Council, India should particularly guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards. Action requested Please write to the authorities in India urging them to:   Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of the above mentioned individuals, including access to appropriate medical assistance if necessary;  Order a thorough and impartial investigation into these events in order to identify all those responsible, bring them to trial and apply the penal and/or administrative sanctions as provided by law;  Guarantee that adequate compensation is awarded to the victims;  Ensure respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standard.
