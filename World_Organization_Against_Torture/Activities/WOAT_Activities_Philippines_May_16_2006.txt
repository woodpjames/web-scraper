Brief description of the situationThe International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Task Force Detainees of the Philippines (TFDP), a member of the OMCT network, of the arbitrary arrest of five farmers, allegedly suspected as NPA members, at Barangay Sungay in Tagaytay City by members of the Philippine National Police (PNP)-Calabarzon on 28 April 2006.  According to the information received, Mr. Riel Custodio, Mr. Axel Alejandro Pinpin, Mr. Aristides Sarmiento, Mr. Enrico Ybañez and Mr. Michael Masayes, now referred to as the Tagaytay five, were on their way to Manila after they left Barangay Tolentino in Tagaytay City around 6.25pm. The Tagaytay five were reached by mobile phones by their family and friends until 7.00pm after which they could no longer be reached and their whereabouts remained unknown. Although the families of the five men went to different military camps and to police precincts, both the police and the military denied having the five men in custody. It is reported that Mr. Riel Custodio, Mr. Axel Alejandro Pinpin and Mr. Aristides Sarmiento are known members of the Kalipunan ng mga Magsasaka sa Kabite (Kamagsasaka-Ka or Farmers’ Federation in Cavite, central/southern Luzon).  According to the information received, on 1 May 2006, the Tagaytay five were presented to the media in Camp Crame. According to the Philippine police, mobile phones, two laptops, a flash and floppy discs were seized from the men. Moreover, it was alleged by the police that on the mobile phones text messages between suspected members of the New People’s Army (NPA) and unidentified members of the Magdalo group of rebel soldiers, involved in the Oakwood mutiny of 2003, were found. Furthermore, assorted receipts, allegedly showing the purchase of ammonium nitrate and 8000 small metal balls, basic components for the manufacture of improvised bombs, were seized as well.   It is reported that after they were held incommunicado for almost a week, the Tagaytay five were presented to Judge Edwin Larida at the Tagaytay City Regional Court on 5 May 2006 and charged with rebellion for their alleged plan to infiltrate the Labor Day celebration. The PNP had earlier denied of having custody of the five men. Shortly after this the Tagaytay men were allowed to see their relatives, who staged a rally in front of Camp Vicente Lim in Calamba, Laguna, where the men are currently detained. At the moment, no date for the trial is known. Action requestedPlease write to the authorities in the Philippines urging them to: 1.
