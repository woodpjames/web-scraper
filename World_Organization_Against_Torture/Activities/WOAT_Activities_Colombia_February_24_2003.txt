ESCR Use of Force/ Arrests/Violations of trade union and labour rights   The International Secretariat of OMCT requests your URGENT intervention in the following situation in Colombia.   Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Central Unitaria de Trabajadores de Colombia (CUT), a member of the OMCT network, of the attack launched by the Colombian army on February 21st 2003 against the workers of ECOPETROL (Empresa Colombiana de Petroleros), in Barrancabermeja, Departement of Santander in Colombia.  According to the information received, on February 21st 2003 the army entered the premises of the ECOPETROL refinery in Barrancabermeja  following instructions of the President of ECOPETROL Mr. Isaac Yanovich and brutally repressed the workers. It is reported that the following nine persons have been wounded in the operation, including fractures to the skull, the jaw, the arm and the collon-bone, due to shootings and the use of butts of guns and bayonets:  -	Carlos Antonio Madero -	Carlos Ramírez -	Orlando Saenz -	William Ariza -	Martín Emilio Rondón  -	Richard Díaz -	Alexander Torres -	Pedro Zambrano  -	Dario Barrera  Moreover, according to the information received, the following nine persons have also been arrested in the operation:  -	Eliécer Ortiz -	Jose Leonidas Mantilla -	Ezequiel Benitez -	Ciro Pinzón  -	Ardulfo Díaz -	Jorge Munera -	Hector Salazar  -	Eloy Martínez -	Ramón Gómez    Background information   The intervention by the Colombian Army occurs against the background of a labour dispute opposing the direction of ECOPETROL with its workers, including workers who are affiliated with the Oil Workers Union (USO). This intervention also reportedly occurs in the context of  an ongoing campaign of persecution and harassment against the members of USO by paramilitary groups.  According to the information received, the intervention of the Colombian Army on February 21st 2003 has been preceded by the revocation, on December 31st 2002, of the Labour Agreement by ECOPETROL’s executive, leading to a conflict between the ECOPETROL’s executive and employees.
