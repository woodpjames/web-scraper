Ongoing enforced disappearance
Sri Lanka
March 15, 2012
 
The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint 
programme of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World 
Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), has received new information and requests 
your urgent intervention in the following situation in Sri 
Lanka.
 
New information:
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the 
ongoing enforced disappearance of Mr. Sinnavan Stephen Sunthararaj, Project Manager at the Centre for Human Rights and Development 
(CHRD), well known for documenting cases of child abuse in Jaffna and District 
Child Coordinator from 2003 to 2005. Mr. Sunthararaj was last seen on the 
evening of May 7, 2009, when he was abducted by unknown gunmen in army uniforms 
whilst travelling in his lawyer's car, a few hours after his release (see 
background information). 
 
February 1, 2012 marked the 1000th day of Mr. Stephen Sunthararaj's 
enforced disappearance. 
 
In December 2009, the Permanent Secretary to the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, Mr. Palitha Kohana, had revealed at a meeting with United States 
Embassy and European Union officials that Mr. Sunthararaj had not been abducted 
but arrested, probably by intelligence services. 
 
Since then, Mr. Sunthararaj's wife has been writing to the Office of 
the President of Sri Lanka, urging him to reveal Mr. Sunthararaj's place of 
detention, and calling for his immediate release. She has still not received any 
response, in spite all her efforts.
 
Since May 2009 no information has been obtained concerning Mr. 
Sunthararaj’s whereabouts.
 
The Observatory strongly condemns Mr. Sunthararaj’s ongoing enforced 
disappearance, and fears for his physical and psychological integrity. The 
Observatory calls upon the Sri Lankan authorities to take prompt action in order 
to disclose the whereabouts of Mr. Sunthararaj and release him immediately as 
his abduction and detention seem to merely aim at sanctioning his human rights 
activities.
 
Background information:
 
On February 12, 2009, members of the Special Task Force (STF) tried 
to force Mr. Sinnavan Stephen Sunthararaj into a van as he was leaving his 
office. A nearby police officer and a colleague were able to prevent the STF 
members from taking Mr. Sunthararaj. The STF officers then requested that the 
police officer take him to the Kolpity police station where he was formally 
detained on the basis of a two-month detention order, without 
charge.
 
On May 7, 2009, early in the afternoon, Mr. Sunthararaj was released 
without being charged upon order of the Supreme Court of Halstrup as there was 
no evidence involving him in any offence. While returning from court in the 
vehicle of their lawyer, Mr. and Ms. Sunthararaj noticed that they were being 
followed by two persons travelling on a motorbike, supposedly two army 
intelligence officers in plain clothes. After leaving their children with one of 
Mr. Sunthararaj’s colleague, Mr. and Ms. Sunthararaj stopped at the Kolpity 
police station to get back his mobile phone, passport and other personal 
belongings. After they resumed their journey, while they were approaching the 
Town Hall Junction two persons on a motorbike blocked their way and 
simultaneously a white van approached. Five armed men in army uniform alighted 
of the van, opened the door of the vehicle in which Mr. Sunthararaj was 
travelling, bundled him into the van and sped off. According to the information 
received, those events occurred in a busy and crowded street. One of men removed 
the keys from the car that Mr. Sunthararaj and his family was travelling in and 
fled from the scene in the van. 
 
Afterwards, the officers of the Cinnamon Garden police station 
arrived and took the vehicle together with the passengers to the station where 
their statements were collected. Mr. Sunthararaj’s wife has identified one of 
the perpetrators of the abduction as one of the Criminal Investigation 
Department officers who had previously visited her home for inquiries while her 
husband was held at Kolpity police station. However, no investigation was 
initiated.
