Minister of External 
Relations
Government of Angola

Republic of Angola
 
 
11th of August, 
2011
 
Your Excellency
 
We, the undersigned international civil society 
organisations, are writing to draw your attention to a number of concerns and to 
present urgent requests with regard to the human rights situation in 
Angola.
We are aware of the statement presented by the Secretary 
of State of External Relations Mr. Manuel Domingos Augusto at the 
16th regular session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva; and call 
on the Government of Angola to ensure the full implementation of the human 
rights principles in respect of which the commitment of your Government was thus 
confirmed[1]. 
 
We cite the following documented examples of human rights 
abuses to illustrate our concerns and the risks of contradiction with the said 
statement: 
 
Human rights 
defenders
 
- Activists, staff and members of the human rights 
defenders’ organisation ‘Associação Mãos Livres’ have been victims of threats 
and had assets destroyed by unknown persons[2]
- Journalists have suffered threats and intimidation, or 
have been prosecuted, in different parts of the country in a variety of 
circumstances[3]
- SOS Habitat coordinator, Luiz Araujo, filed a detailed 
complaint at the police regarding a murder attempt against him in august 2009, 
but two years later there are no known results of that 
investigation[4]
- Young activists have suffered intimidation and 
anonymous death threats because of their involvement in public demonstrations 
[5]
 
Victims of evictions, 
demolitions, and market closures[6]
- The majority of the poor families who lost homes and 
property as a result of demolitions and evictions in Lubango, Huila province, in 
March 2010, are still living in inhumane conditions similar to “refugee camps” 
in Tchimukua and Tchavola areas. They suffer from insufficient access to water, 
shelter, health and education facilities and policing to protect them, and above 
all from lack of possibilities to earn an income to reconstruct their 
lives.[7]
- In Luanda, 
informal markets which have provided basic income for thousands of poor 
families have been gradually closed down without significant alternatives for 
the workers. Street vendors, many of them women, are often harassed and stripped 
of their belongings by fiscals / policemen, leaving citizens without means to 
earn their living. [8]
  
- Rural and urban poor communities and families still 
don’t have their rights to land and housing guaranteed.[9]    

 
Victims of sexual 
violence
-         From the 1st to the 
19th of April 2011, at least 100 women were raped during the expulsion of 5,400 
Congolese from Angola[10].
-         Since December 2003, 
tens of thousands of Congolese women and girls have been sexually abused during 
their expulsion from Angola to the Democratic Republic of Congo, by members of 
the Angolan Armed Forces (FAA).[11]
-         Until today, no member 
of the FAA responsible by these acts of sexual violence has been sanctioned nor 
tried
-         No serious 
investigation about these violences has been opened and no specific known 
instructions were given to the FAA to put an end to abuses 

 
 
We therefore call on the 
Government of Angola to ensure that:
 
with regard to human rights 
defenders
-    
Threats and attacks human rights 
defenders have suffered - including civil society activists, journalists, lawyers, religious 
leaders, academics and artists - are investigated by the police in a timely 
and efficient manner. 
-    
The results of such investigations are 
made public and perpetrators are 
prosecuted;
-    
Other protection measures for human 
rights defenders are put in place as a matter of 
urgency.
 
 with regard to the victims of 
evictions, house demolitions and market closures 
-          The right of poor citizens to land and to adequate 
housing is guaranteed in practice, as per the international and regional human 
rights instruments of which Angola is a State Party[12]
-          The right of every woman and man to earn a living, especially in the 
cities, is also guaranteed in practice. For instance, the closure of 
informal markets should be preceded and accompanied by government measures to 
provide vendors with viable alternative income-generating ways for the majority 
to be able to earn a decent living.
 
with regard to the victims of sexual 
violence
-          
That the violence against deportees from 
Angola to DRC, including sexual violence, are subject to a thorough, rigorous investigation, with the support
of the international 
community
-          
 That its report and its findings are made ​​public 
and the authors and perpetrators of these acts are punished and prosecuted according to law.
 
We look forward to hearing from you as a matter of 
urgency with your proposals for the implementation of these basic human rights 
in accordance with your Government’s expressed 
commitment.
 
 
Yours faithfully

[1] We recall that in 
this statement the Secretary of State, representing the Government of Angola, 
mentions for instance that the UPR (Universal Periodic Review) has been an 
important instrument to review the countries’ human rights situation; and 
commends the contribution of civil society, among other aspects, to making the 
Human Rights Council “an important tool in addressing human rights abuses 
worldwide”. His Excellency also stresses “the importance the Government of 
Angola attaches to improving living conditions of its people and ensuring the 
enjoyment of the basic rights of its citizenry”; adding that “The Government of 
Angola has already begun taking measures to address all the concerns that were 
raised at its review”.

“recognize the right of everyone to an adequate standard of living for himself 
and his family, including adequate food, clothing and housing, and to the 
continuous improvement of living conditions”.
