The detainees are only allowed two hours of “exercise” in an open air corridor, or in the corridor what is described as an “oven” detention.  It should be noted that this is the only time that the detainees are supervised by guards.  The temperature of the prison in the summer is often 45 C and does not descend below 35 C.  The hot summer begins in May, although this year due to a particularly dry season, it is already extremely hot already.  Brief reminder of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT expressed its grave concern for the physical and psychological integrity of 29 Oromos (Ethiopian citizens) boys, allegedly detained and subjected to sexual abuse by fellow adult inmates and prison guards in ‘Prison de Gabode’ in Djibouti for the last 6 months.  It is reported that these children were arrested in the street following their arrival in Djibouti from Ethiopia as refugees from the regional conflict.  The International Secretariat of OMCT recalls that Djibouti is a state party to the Convention on the Rights of the Child and has obligations to the provisions of this Convention, particularly Articles 3, 37 and 40.  Action requested  Please write to the authorities in Djibouti urging them to:  i.	take all necessary measures to guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of these children; ii.	order their immediate release in the absence of valid legal charges; iii.	guarantee an immediate investigation into the alleged sexual abuse and ill-treatment, identify those responsible, bring them before a civil competent and impartial tribunal and apply the penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions provided by law; iv.	guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards, particularly the Convention on the Rights of the Child, ratified by Djibouti.
