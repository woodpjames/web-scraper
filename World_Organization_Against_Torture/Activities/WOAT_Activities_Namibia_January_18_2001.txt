New information  The Observatory has received new information from the National Society for Human Rights, (NSHR), a member of the OMCT network, that Moses Nasilele, head of NSHR regional monitoring office (RMO) at Katima Mulilo, Caprivi region, was expelled to Zambia soon after his temporary detention on February 28th 2000 by alleged members of the National Central Intelligence Service (NCIS). He reportedly later traveled to Botswana where he is currently seeking for refugee status.  The Observatory has also been informed that human rights defender Gabriel Mwilima, who had been arrested in the Caprivi strip on 2nd August 1999, is still held in Grootfontein prison on charges of high treason.  Furthermore, Joseph Muchali, another NSHR activist from Caprivi region who had disappeared without trace after Namibian security forces having detained him on August 6, 1999, has allegedly fled later on to neighboring Botswana, where he reportedly sought refugee status.   Brief reminder of the situation  The Observatory had been informed by the National Society for Human Rights, (NSHR), a member of the OMCT network, of the harassment of Moses Nasilele. According to the information received, on February 28th 2000, Moses Nasilele had temporarily been held for questioning by alleged members of the National Central Intelligence Service (NCIS) who accused him of holding «a meeting» at his office in the town.  The Observatory noted that this and other incidents were part of a general state of insecurity following the imposition of a state of emergency in the region one and a half years ago, on 2nd August 1999.  The Observatory fears that the disappearance of Joseph Muchali, the arrest and expulsion of Moses Nasilele as well as the charges against Gabriel Mwilima are due to their activities in defense of human rights.   Action requested :  Please write to the Namibian authorities urging them to:  i.-	guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of Gabriel Mwilima and order his immediate release;  ii.-	adopt all necessary measures in order to ensure full freedom of action of human rights organisations as well as their members;  iii.	to conform to the arrangements of the Declaration of Human Rights Defenders adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on the 9 December 1998, and notably by Article 1 which states that « Everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels» and Article 6.b which stipulates that « Everyone has the right, individually and in association with others (...), to publish, impart or disseminate to others views, information and knowledge on all human rights and fundamental freedoms ».    iv.-	to conform, more generally, to the dispositions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the international Covenants relative to Human Rights which bind Namibia.
