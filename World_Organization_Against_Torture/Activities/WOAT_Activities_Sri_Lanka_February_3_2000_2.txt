The International Secretariat of OMCT has received new information regarding the following situation in Sri Lanka.  Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT was informed by a reliable source of the arrest and disappearance of Mrs. Valarmathy Sriskantharajah (aged 42) and her two children aged 15 and 12 (see case LKA 280100.CC), on 25th January 2000, at their home in Urumpirai, by Sri Lankan Police forces who reportedly came with a Militia Group EPDP members (Eelam People’s Democratic Front).  Her husband, Mr. Sriskantharajah (aged 45) currently resides in Switzerland having claimed refugee status in 1991.  The reason for their arrest is believed to be that her eldest son, arrested in Colombo on Saturday 22nd January 2000, is a suspected member of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.    The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned for their physical and psychological integrity, particularly as it is reported by the family physician that Mrs. Sriskantharajah is of weak health and that her son, Vinoth, suffers from fits.  Their whereabouts was unknown.  New Information  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed that Mrs. Sriskantharajah was released, along with her two children, yesterday 2nd February 2000.  No other information is yet known regarding their ordeal.
