This refers to an argument in January 2015 between Mr. Kankya, his colleague Mr. Simon Amanyire and Mr. Rodger Martin, manager of programs at Better FM, a local radio station, after the latter attempted to cancel a scheduled program produced by TLC. Although, Mr. Martin confirmed to the police that the argument was purely verbal, and that he had no intention to proceed with a criminal complaint, the police decided to file the case to the Court on charges of “simple assault”. Mr. Kankya appeared before the Magistrates Court on March 24, 2015 and was released on a 50,000 Uganda Shillings (approximately 15 Euro) bail with two sureties of 20,000 Uganda shillings (approximately 6 Euro) each. The next hearing is scheduled on March 31, 2015. TLC broadcasts weekly programs on human rights education, performs capacity building to enhance the ability of human rights defenders to perform their activities in the region, provides civic education, monitors and documents human rights violations, and challenges unlawful government actions in court. Lately, TLC has been running a petition campaign to the President Mr. Yoweri Museveni against Queen Mother Best Kemigisa Nursery, Primary and Vocational School, a private commercial project developed on land grabbed from illegal expropriations. In 2012, Mr. Gerald Kankya received the European Union Human Rights Defender Award in Uganda. The Observatory recalls that in a separate case, on January 23, 2015, Messrs. Gerald Kankya and Simon Amanyire were assaulted by approximatively 30 men wearing Queen Mother Best Kemigisa Nursery, Primary and Vocational Schools traffic reflectors jackets, armed with clubs and allegedly commanded by the District Police commander Mr. Geoffrey Kahebwa and another police officer. Despite Mr. Kankya's grievous harm, medically ascertained, the police refused to record his complaint[1]. In relation to this incident,Mr. Kankya is being prosecuted for “grave assault”. Granted a 500,000 Uganda Shillings (approximately 153 Euro) bail with two sureties of 100,000 Uganda Shillings (approximately 30 Euro) each, he is summoned to appear in Court on April 7, 2015. The Observatory expresses its deepest concerns about the judicial harassment of Mr. Gerald Kankya and fears that he is being targeted as a result of his human rights activities. Therefore, the Observatory calls upon authorities in Uganda to immediately drop all charges against him. Action requested: Please write to the authorities in Uganda, urging them to: i.      Put an end to all kinds of harassment, including at the judicial level, against Mr. Gerald Kankya, as well as of all human rights defenders in Uganda; ii.     Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Gerald Kankya, as well as all human rights defenders in Uganda, including those addressing land-related issues; iii.    Order an immediate, thorough, transparent investigation into the beating of Messrs. Gerald Kankya and Amanyire on January 23, 2015, in order to identify all those responsible, bring them before an independent tribunal, and apply them the sanctions provided by the law; iv.    Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially: - Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”; - Article 5, which underscores the right of every individual to form, join, and participate in non-governmental organizations; and - Article 12.2, which provides that the State shall “take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of his or her rights”; v.     Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by Uganda. Addresses: ·         President Kaguta Yoweri Museveni, President of the Republic of Uganda, Office of  the President of Uganda, State House Nakasero, P.O.
