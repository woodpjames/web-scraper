Harassment
Belarus
August 20, 2012
 
The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of
the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation
Against Torture (OMCT), has received new information and requests your urgent
intervention in the following situation in Belarus.
 
Description of the situation:
 
The
Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the interrogation by
the KGB of Ms. Tatsiana Revyaka, Board member of the Human Rights Centre
“Viasna”.
 
According to the information received, on August 17,
2012, Ms. Revyaka was summoned to the KGB “as a person knowledgeable about the
circumstances relevant to the national security of the Republic of Belarus”.
 
Ms. Tatsiana Revyaka reported that KGB officers
interrogated her about a publication on Viasna website on August 15, 2012
titled “Mahiliou KGB interferes with electoral process”. The officers also
showed her a printout from the website charter97.org containing the same
reprinted information under the heading “Mogilev KGB terrorises collectors of
signatures”. The officers also inquired about the source of the information and
its authors and asked her whether she checked the date mentioned in the
article, arguing that publishing such information without confirming it would
discredit the state security of Belarus. As a result, Ms. Revyaka was warned
over the publication of unchecked information on Viasna's website.
 
However,
despite all these verbal criticisms, the KGB allegedly told Ms. Revyaka that it
had no legal motivation to open judicial proceedings against her.
 
The
said publication describes how a KGB officer in Mogilev broke into the
apartment of Mr. Uladislau Yaroshau, a collector of signatures and student at
the Mogilev State University of Arkady Kuliashou, and tried to learn about how
much money he received for the collection of signatures and who managed the
process. He threatened to dismiss Mr. Yaroshau from the university for his work
in the team of an opposition candidate and proposed to him to cooperate with
the KGB.
 
The
Observatory strongly condemns the harassment of Ms. Tatsiana Revyaka, since it
seems to merely aim at sanctioning her human rights activities.
 
The
Observatory is particularly concerned that the pressure on her, and more
generally on human rights defenders, has intensified in the current
pre-electoral context, while HRC Viasna and the Belarusian Helsinki Committee
conduct monitoring of the electoral process in the framework of a campaign
entitled “Human Rights Defenders for Free Elections”.
 
Actions requested :
 
Please
write to the Belarusian authorities, urging them to :
 
i. Guarantee in all
circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Ms. Tatsiana Revyaka, as well as of all human
rights defenders in Belarus;
 
iii. Put an end to any kind
of harassment - including at the judicial level - against Ms. Tatsiana Revyaka
as well as against all other human rights defenders in Belarus;
 
iv. Conform with the
provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the
General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially:
- its Article 1, which states that “everyone has
the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to
strive for the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental
freedoms at the national and international levels”,
- its Article 6 (b) and (c), which states that
“Everyone has the right, individually and in association with others […] as
provided for in human rights and other applicable international instruments,
freely to publish, impart or disseminate to others views, information and
knowledge on all human rights and fundamental freedoms and [...] to study,
discuss, form and hold opinions on the observance, both in law and in practice,
of all human rights and fundamental freedoms and, through these and other
appropriate means, to draw public attention to those matters”.
- and its Article 12.2, which provides that “the
State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the
competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others,
against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse
discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his
or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present
Declaration” ;
 
v. Ensure in all
circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance
with international human rights standards and international instruments
ratified by the Belarusian Republic.
