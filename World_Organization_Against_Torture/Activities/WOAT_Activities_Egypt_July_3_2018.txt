She is also a former member of the now banned “April 6 Youth Movement”. Ms. Amal Fathy is married to Mr. Mohamed Lotfy, Executive Director of the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF).  According to the information received, on July 2, 2018, the National Security Prosecution Office extended Ms. Amal Fathy pre-trial detention for the fifth time for a further 15 days period. The next hearing to review her pre-trial detention will be on July 15, 2018. Ms. Fathy has been in pre-trial detention since May 11, 2018. She is facing two sets of accusations: under Case No. 7991 of 2018 she is accused of “broadcasting a video harming national security”, “posting a video inciting to overthrow the regime and spreading false rumours”, and “misusing social media” and under Case No. 621 of 2018 she is facing charges of “joining a terrorist group”, “publishing false news to disrupt public security and harm national interests” and “using the internet to call for acts of terrorism” (see background information). According to the same sources, Ms. Amal Fathy’s health conditions are rapidly deteriorating as she suffers from acute stress reaction caused by her arbitrary detention. While she appeared before the Prosecution Office on July 2, 2018, she was not able to walk on her own and she was diagnosed with paralysis in her left leg.  The Observatory recalls that, on June 21, 2018, the Criminal Court of South Cairo approved the release on bail of Ms. Amal Fathy within the framework of Case No. 7991 of 2018 but that she remains nonetheless in detention pending investigation within the framework of Case No. 621 of 2018. The Observatory is extremely concerned by the ongoing arbitrary detention of Ms. Fathy and by the impact that this situation is having on her health conditions. Therefore, the Observatory urges the Egyptian authorities to immediately and unconditionally release Ms. Fathy and, in the meanwhile, to ensure that she has access to adequate health care and to a psychiatrist.  Background information: On May 9, 2018, Ms. Amal Fathy posted a 12-minute video on Facebookcriticising the Egyptian Government for its failure to protect women against sexual harassment as well as over a general deterioration in living conditions in the country. The next day, pro-government and State-owned media outlets released articles citing the video, identifying Ms. Amal Fathy as an “April 6 Youth movement” activist, the wife of Mr. Mohamed Lotfy and accusing her of insulting Egypt and Egyptian institutions. This was followed by a wave of harassment and threats on social media against Ms. Amal Fathy. On May 11, 2018, at around 2.30 am, Egyptian security forces raided the house of Ms. Amal Fathy and Mr. Mohamed Lotfy in Cairo and started searching it. Their mobile phones were seized and they were denied the right to communicate with a lawyer or their relatives. The two activists were brought to Maadi police station, in southern Cairo, along with their three-year-old son. Around three hours later, Mr. Lotfy and his son were released. The Maadi Prosecutor subsequently placed Ms. Amal Fathy under preventive detention for 15 days within the framework of Criminal case No. 7991 of 2018. On May 12, 2018, Ms. Amal Fathy was transferred to Qanater women’s prison.  On May 13, 2018, Ms. Amal Fathy was questioned by the High State Security Prosecution about the “April 6 Youth Movement”, ECRF and the activities of her husband. She was then placed under preventive detention for an additional 15 days in the framework of another case, Criminal case No. 621 of 2018. On May 24, the Maadi Prosecutor extended Ms. Amal Fathy’s preventive detention for 15 additional days within the framework of Case No. 7991 of 2018, without providing reason. Ms. Fathy appealed the decision. On May 30, 2018, Ms. Fathy’s appeal was rejected.  On June 7, 2018, the Maadi Prosecutor extended for the third time Ms. Amal Fathy’s preventive detention for a further 2-week period, without providing any reason. On June 21, 2018, the Criminal Court of South Cairo approved the release on bail of Ms. Amal Fathy within the framework of Case No. 7991 of 2018 upon payment of a 10’000 EGP guarantee (approximately 480 EUR).  Actions requested: Please write to the authorities of Egypt asking them to: i.Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Ms. Amal Fathy, Mr. Mohamed Lotfy, their relatives and all human rights defenders in Egypt, including by ensuring adequate access to medical care; ii. Immediately and unconditionally release Ms. Amal Fathy as her detention is arbitrary as it is merely aimed at punishing her for her human rights activities as well as those of her husband; iii. Put an end to all acts of harassment, including at the judicial level, against Ms. Amal Fathy as well as against Mr. Mohamed Lotfy and all human rights defenders in Egypt, and ensure that they are able to carry out their activities without hindrance;  iv. Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially Articles 1, 6(c) and 12.2; and v. More generally, ensure in all circumstances the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with international and regional human rights instruments ratified by Egypt. Addresses: ·     President of the Arab Republic of Egypt, H.E.
