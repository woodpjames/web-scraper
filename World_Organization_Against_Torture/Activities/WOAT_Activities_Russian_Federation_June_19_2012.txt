The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights
Defenders, a joint programme of the International Federation for Human Rights
(FIDH) and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent
intervention in the following situation in the Russian Federation.
 
Description of the situation:
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources
about the threats against Mr. Rustam Matsev, lawyer and member of the human rights organisation “Memorial” in the
Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria, Russian Federation. 
 
According to the information received, on May 31,
2012, Mr. Rustam Matsev went to the police station of Nalchik where his client,
Mr. Labazanov, was held in pre-trial detention. As his lawyer, he was there to
assist Mr. Labazanov during his questioning by Mr. Phitikov,
investigator of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs, in charge of the
case. Mr. Labazanov had been kidnapped and beaten up by members of the security
forces on February 10, 2012. He was then improperly charged with carrying explosive devices , on the basis of Article 222 of the Russian Criminal Code. 
 
While Mr. Matsev was waiting for Mr. Labazanov to be
questioned, Mr. Zavyalikov, a criminal police officer, started to accuse Mr.
Matsev of having encouraged his client to lie about his kidnapping in his
previous statements. Mr. Matsev reminded Mr. Zavyalikov that the very work of a
lawyer was to provide legal assistance.
 
Mr. Zavyalikov also questioned Mr. Matsev about his
personal life and asked him among others if he was wearing underwear. He also
threatened him by stating that Mr. Matsev was being watched by police officers
and advised him to be careful.
 
Mr. Zavyalikov subsequently tried to pressure Mr.
Matsev into compelling his client to plead guilty, and to accept a deal with
the prosecution. As Mr. Matsev refused to follow Mr. Zavyalikov's demands, the
latter tried himself to put pressure on Mr. Labazanov during the questioning
led by Mr. Phitikov.
 
Following these threats, Mr. Matsev addressed a
statement on June 1, 2012 to the General Attorney of the Russian Federation, to
the Prosecutor of the Republic of Kabardino – Balkaria, and to other judicial
and civil society authorities, requesting that criminal charges be brought
against Mr. Zavyalikov. Mr. Matsev also asked the Prosecutor to open an
investigation into these threats, under Articles 144 and 145 of the Russian
Criminal Code. However, no information could be obtained as to whether any
investigation was opened as of issuing this urgent appeal.
 
The Observatory strongly condemns these
acts of intimidation against Mr. Matsev, and fears that they aim at sanctioning
his human rights activities, and in particular
the legal assistance he provided as a human rights lawyer. 
 
The Observatory recalls that according to
Principle 8 of the Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers, “All arrested,
detained or imprisoned persons shall be provided with adequate opportunities, time
and facilities to be visited by and to communicate and consult with a lawyer,
without delay, interception or censorship”.
 
Actions requested:
 
Please write to the authorities of the Russian
Federation, urging them to: 
 
i. Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity
of Mr. Matsev as well as of all human rights defenders in the Russian
Federation;
 
ii. Carry out a thorough, impartial and transparent investigation into the
above mentioned events in order to identify all those responsible, bring them
before a competent and impartial tribunal and apply to them the sanctions
provided by the law;
 
iii. Put an end to any act of harassment - including at the judicial level -
against Mr. Matsev as well as against all human rights
defenders in the Russian Federation, and ensure in all circumstances that they
are able to carry out their legitimate activities without any hindrance and
fear of reprisals; 
 
iv. Comply with the provisions of the United Nations Declaration on Human
Rights Defenders, adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 9, 1998,
especially:
 
-         
its Article 1, which
states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with
others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human
rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”,
 
-         
and Article 12.2, which
provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the
protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in
association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto
or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a
consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the
present Declaration”; 
 
v. Comply with the provisions of the Declaration of the Committee of
Ministers of the Council of Europe on the protection of human rights defenders
and the promotion of their activities, and in particular with Article 2.i), in
which the Committee calls on member States to “create an environment conducive
to the work of human rights defenders, enabling individuals, groups and
associations to freely carry out activities, on a legal basis, consistent with
international standards, to promote and strive for the protection of human
rights and fundamental freedoms without any restrictions other than those
authorised by the European Convention on Human Rights;
 
vi. More generally, ensure in all circumstances the respect for human
rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights and with international and regional human rights instruments
ratified by the Russian Federation.
