Sentencing to prison / Judicial harassment
Turkey

The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), has received new information and requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in Turkey.
 
Description of the situation:
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the continuing judicial harassment and sentencing to prison of Ms. Buse Kılıçkaya, Ms. Selay Tunç and Ms. Naz Gudumen, respectively founder and Chairperson, founder and Vice-chairperson and member of the Pink Life LGBTT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Travesty and Transsexual) Solidarity Association.
 
According to the information received, on October 25, 2011, Ms. Buse Kilickaya, Ms. Selay Tunc and Ms. Naz Gudumen were found guilty of the charges of “resisting public officials and preventing them from performing their duty” and “insults” by the Ankara 15th Court of First Instance. Ms. Buse Kilickaya was convicted of “resisting public officials and preventing them from performing their duty” and was sentenced to five months in prison. Ms. Selay Tunc was convicted of the same charge and received a suspended six-month prison sentence. Ms. Naz Gudumen was convicted of “resisting public officials and preventing them from performing their duty” and “insults” and received a suspended 18-month prison sentence. Pending appeal of her sentencing to an unsuspended term of prison, Ms. Buse Kilickaya remains free.
 
On June 19, 2010, Ms. Buse Kılıçkaya, Ms. Selay Tunç and Ms. Naz Gudumen were arbitrarily arrested by police officers while driving through the Seyranbaglari Mah neighbourhood in Ankara. The police did not provide any reason for the arrest and when the human rights defenders asked the legal basis of the arrest, the police officers only said that they wanted them to get out of the car and that they would take them to the police station. The human rights defenders then told the police officers that they would not go to the police station in the absence of legal reason. The police officers responded “your crime is that you do transvestitism”. They responded that being trans is an identity not a job and that they wanted to show their IDs or driving licences to the police officers however the police officers rejected this and insisted on taking them to the police station. When the human rights defenders rejected this, the police officers started to forcibly pull them out from the car, using violence against them and insulting them because of their gender identities. They were taken to the police station and held for five hours before being released. Although the human rights defenders filed an official complaint for ill-treatment and insults with the Public Prosecutor, the latter dismissed their complaint and instead permitted charges against them for “resisting the police” and “damaging public property”[1]. 
 
The Observatory believes that the arbitrary arrest and sentencing of Ms. Buse Kilickaya, Ms. Selay Tunc and Ms. Naz Gudumen are directly related to their legitimate human rights work in defence of transgender people, and expresses its concern at the frequent targeting of LGBTT human rights defenders in Turkey.
