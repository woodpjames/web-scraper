New information: The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the release of Ms. Larisa Arap, a Russian journalist and opposition activist who had recently denounced the treatment of children in psychiatric hospitals in the Murmansk region. According to the information received, on August 20, 2007, around noon, a medical committee informed Ms. Larisa Arap that she was released from the psychiatric hospital where she was forcibly held in the city of Apatity. The doctors did not explain their decision and made her sign an agreement to continue her prescribed treatment at home. The Observatory welcomes the release of Ms. Larisa Arap and wishes to thank all the persons, organisations, and institutions that intervened in her favour. Nevertheless, the Observatory expresses its deep concern regarding alleged acts of ill-treatment Ms. Arap would have been subjected to while forcibly hospitalised, and calls upon the Russian authorities to conduct a fair and impartial investigation into these allegations so that all those responsible be identified, brought to justice and sentenced according to sanctions provided by law. Background information: On July 5, 2007, Ms. Larisa Arap, a member of the United Civil Front, an opposition movement, was arrested in a clinic in Murmansk where she had gone for a medical examination to renew her driver’s licence. Following her arrest, she was transferred to a psychiatric hospital 150 km outside Murmansk, and would have been forcefully injected with drugs, beaten and tied to a bed. Ms. Arap’s arrest followed the publication, on June 8, 2007, of an article she had written on the ill-treatment of children in psychiatric hospitals in the Murmansk region, in Marsh Nesoglasnykh (Dissenters’ March), the newspaper published by the United Civil Front. In particular, she criticised the use of electroshock and alleged that patients would have been beaten and raped. On July 18, 2007, a Murmansk district court signed an order for Ms. Arap’s compulsory treatment. On July 26, 2007, Ms. Arap was taken to the hospital she had criticised in her article, in Apatity, and on August 12, 2007, a local district court upheld the order for Ms. Arap’s compulsory treatment. Ms. Arap’s lawyer appealed this decision.
