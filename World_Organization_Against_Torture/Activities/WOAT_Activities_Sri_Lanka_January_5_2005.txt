New Information  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Asian Human Rights Commission (AHRC), a member of the OMCT network, that the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) that has been handling the investigation into the murder of Mr. Gerald Mervin Perera, has arrested and detained Suresh Gunasena, Sub Inspector (SI) of Wattala Police Station, for the murder of Mr Perera.   Furthermore, SIS Suresh Gunasena, Police Constable 38237, Nalin Jayasinghe and Perera, Police Constable 9197 were indicted under the Torture Act of Sri Lanka (Act No. 22 of 1994) for the torture of Mr. Gerald Perera and were transferred from the station in which they were serving.   Sena Uraweera, Chief Inspector of Police and Officer in Charge of Weattala Police Station was removed from his post and transferred to another police station as a supernumerary officer.   Background information  According to the information received, Mr. Perera, a cook at the Colombo Dockyards, residing at 52/2B Iddhagodella, Mihidumawatte, Gonagaha, was allegedly shot on 21 November 2004 at around 11:15am by unknown perpetrators with suspected links to officers of Wattala Police Station. Mr. Perera was a torture victim who had obtained the highest compensation payout from a Supreme Court decision, and who was the complainant in a criminal case of torture against several officers formerly of Wattala Police station, where he was to appear on 2 December 2004. He succumbed to his injuries on 24 November 2004.   Prior to his murder, Mr. Perera had been under pressure to withdraw the case against the afore-mentioned officers in Negombo High Court.  During a number of weeks before Mr. Perera was murdered, AHRC reported that he had been under pressure to withdraw the case against the before mentioned officers. A group of police officers reportedly visited Mr. Perera’s home. Acquaintances of Mr. Perera were also approached.  OMCT is satisfied that measures have been taken to put an end to the impunity of the suspected perpetrators but is surprised that Mr. Perera did not benefit from better protection in view of the pressure exerted on him.   Action Requested Please write to the authorities in Sri Lanka urging them to :  i. bring those indicted to trial and apply the penal and/or administrative sanctions as provided by law;  ii. take relevant measures to protect witnesses and evidence in relation to Mr. Perera’s death;  iii. guarantee that adequate reparation is provided to the victim’s family;  iv. guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
