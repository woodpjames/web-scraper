Description of the situation: The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources of acts of violence against Ms. Valentina Uzunova, a lawyer and one of Russia's experts on racial issues and hate crimes, as well as a member of the NGO “For a Russia Without Racism”. According to the information received, Ms. Uzunova was attacked on June 19, 2007 by a female assailant, dressed in camouflage and wearing a mask. She was on her way back from visiting the relatives of Mr. Nicolai Girenko, one  of her former colleagues, a human rights defender and an expert on ethnic issues who was killed on the same day three years ago, on June 19, 2004. Her aggressor hit her several times on the head. Ms. Uzunova sustained a concussion and hematomas on her head. Over the past months, Ms. Uzunova had received threats of violence from anonymous sources. In a recent anonymous call, the caller threatened to execute her and her family if she did not help to clear Mr. Vladislav Nikolsky, who is currently facing charges for incitement to overthrow the constitutional order of the Russian Federation and incitement to racial hatred. Accordingly, Ms. Uzunova appealed for police protection but her request was turned down by the police for “lack of evidence of a credible threat”. The police established the location of the phone booth used to make the phone call but failed to identify the caller. Ms. Uzunova had to give expert testimony before the Vyborski Federal Court on June 20, 2007 in the case of Mr. Vladislav Nikolsky, but the hearing was cancelled because of the attack. The Observatory reiterates its deepest concern over the ongoing climate of hostility against human rights defenders involved in the defence of minority, characterised by the multiplication of physical attacks against them - including assassinations - and by numerous assaults on associations’ offices (see the Observatory international fact-finding mission report, issued in March 2005 and titled Russian Federation: Attacks on human rights defenders in Saint Petersburg, Russian authorities guilty of negligence)[1]. The Observatory recalls that the Russian Federation was elected to the Human Rights Council in June 2006 for three years. In April 2006, the Federation had submitted a document to support its candidacy[2] in which it « proceed[ed] from the assumption that States themselves should bear the main responsibility for the protection of human rights and freedoms ». Actions requested: The Observatory urges the authorities of the Russian Federation to:  guarantee, in all circumstances, the physical and psychological integrity of Ms. Uzunova and more generally of human rights defenders; ensure the conduct of a full and impartial investigation into her attack, so as to identify the perpetrators of these offences, prosecute them and punish them according to the laws in force; ensure the protection of experts in cases related to minorities and to incitement to racial hatred in accordance with Article 9.3 of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, which provides that “ everyone has the right to offer and provide professionally qualified legal assistance or other relevant advice and assistance in defending human rights and fundamental freedoms”; comply with all the provisions of the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the UN General Assembly on December, 9, 1998, in particular with the above-mentioned Article 9.3, with Article 1, which provides that « everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels », and with Article 12.2 which reads that « the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration »; comply with the provisions of the Document of the Copenhagen Meeting of the 2nd Conference on the Human Dimension of the Cooperation and Security Conference in Europe (CSCE) (1990), and uphold in all circumstances the principles and provisions enshrined in the international and regional human rights instruments ratified by the Russian Federation and which, in particular, guarantee freedoms of association, demonstration, expression and opinion, in particular the European Convention on Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

The report also addresses the issue of xenophobia within public administration departments, political and judicial institutions, and it was reported that the refusal to investigate into these violations often gave full permission to their authors.
