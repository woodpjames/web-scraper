The orientation taken in Manila was closely related to a report published by OMCT in 1989 for the first evaluation meeting of the United Nations Program for Least Developed Countries (LDC’s) that addressed the correlation between poor socio-economic performances and gross violations of civil and political rights.   Following Manila, OMCT carried out further reflection on that subject throughout the 1990s and conducted different seminars in the Philippines, India, Kenya and Burkina Faso related to economic policies and the prevention of torture.   This reflection profoundly marked the work of OMCT’s programmes on children and women, inasmuch as these victims are more directly affected by socio-economic inequalities. It also supported the decision taken by the Council of OMCT, in 2000, to create a permanent Programme on ESC rights.   The focus on ESC rights to address the socio-economic considerations in the fight against torture, summary executions, forced disappearances and other forms cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment stems from the fact that any sustainable social integration, along with more equitable societies are out of reach in the absence of conditions guaranteeing such rights as the right to work, trade unions’ rights, the right to education and the right to health. Likewise, eradicating poverty cannot be envisioned without giving a say to individuals. Similarly, the fight against the increasing exclusion of certain groups from society is doomed to fail without an absolute respect of the principle of non-discrimination and access to basic necessities such as water, health care, food or shelter. Consequently, any attempts to improve socio-economic conditions, reduce poverty and fight against inequalities must take into account human rights, and especially ESC rights.
