New Information The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Russian-Chechen Friendship Society (RCFS), a member of OMCT SOS-Torture Network, about the release of Mr. Yury Staroverov, a press person of “The Other Russia” in Nizhny Novgorod and a staff member of the Russian-Chechen Friendship Society as well as of the Novaja Gazeta supplement in Nizhny Novgorod, after completing his sentence on 2 February 2009. However, according to the same information, Mr. Yury Staroverov’s flat was searched later on that same day by agents of the special detachment to counteract extremism, headed by the same police officer who had arrested Mr. Staroverov on 28 January 2009. Three computers as well as fliers were seized. The search was carried out allegedly in connection with an event that occurred on 21 January when unidentified individuals had mounted a banner saying “Putin, Get out!”. The International Secretariat of OMCT remains concerned about the safety of Mr. Yury Staroverov, even though he was released, in particular as he has already been reportedly subjected to numerous threats and provocation by security officers, including UBOP and FSB. Reminder of the situation The International Secretariat of OMCT had been informed about the arbitrary arrest and risk for safety of Mr. Yury Staroverov. According to the information received, Mr. Yury Staroverov was arrested by UBOP (Department for Fighting Organised Crime) while on his way to the office of the Novaja Gazeta on 28 January 2009 but his arrest and whereabouts were only known on 29 January 2009, when he was brought to court. He was reportedly sentenced to five days of administrative detention (under article 20.1 of the Administrative Code) for alleged “cursing” (according to UBOP officer who arrested Mr. Yury Staroverov, he was cursing while standing alone in the staircase of the Novaja Gazeta office building). He was detained at a police placement centre (54 Pakhomov Street) in Nizhny Novgorod. According to the same information received, Mr. Yury Staroverov had been accused on the “Decembrists” case (peaceful seizure of the President’s office in December 2004), for which he had spent one year in Federal Security Service (FSB) investigation prison and then sentenced to three years, sentence which was then suspended. His probation term was over in December 2008 but he had reportedly remained under surveillance by the Department monitoring the execution of punishment. Action requested Please write to the authorities of the Russian Federation urging them to:   Guarantee, in all circumstances, the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Yury Staroverov;  Order a prompt, thorough, impartial and independent investigation into these events in order to identify all those responsible, bring them to trial and apply the civil, penal and/or administrative sanctions as provided by law;  Guarantee adequate reparation to the victim;  Guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
