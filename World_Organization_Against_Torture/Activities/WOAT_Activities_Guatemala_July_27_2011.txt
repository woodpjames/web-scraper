Re: Request to the European Union (EU) to monitor and support the
progress against impunity in Guatemala.
Dear EU Ambassadors in Guatemala, 
Dear Head of the EU Delegation in Guatemala,
The undersigned networks
and European and international civil society organizations welcome the historic
progress against impunity in Guatemala, following the
detention and initiation of legal proceedings against General Héctor Mario
López Fuentes, accused of committing genocide and crimes against humanity. We
ask the EU to pay special attention to such legal proceedings and, in
particular, to the due process as it is unique, historical and of great
importance for the entire Guatemalan society. 
As the alleged
intellectual author, the detainee is accused, among other issues, of being
responsible for twelve massacres, direct deaths, rape, threats and persecution.
He is also accused of creating inhumane conditions for over nine thousand
people, perpetrated against the Ixil Maya people in the department of Quiché,
from 23 March 1982 to October 21 1983, under the regime of General
Efraín Ríos Montt.
This first case of
prosecution of genocide is a historic opportunity for the Guatemalan justice
administration system to continue to take steps towards bringing down the
impunity that has lasted for almost thirty years, guarantee the rights of the
victims' families and survivors to truth, justice and redress, and adopt and
implement measures of non-recurrence, thus promoting the opening of new legal
proceedings for the crimes against humanity committed during the internal armed
conflict that afflicted Guatemala for 36 years.
Having regard to Article
10A of the Treaty of Lisbon of the European Union, the democratic clause laid
down in the Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement between the EU and
Central America, the EU Guidelines on Human Rights -particularly on human
rights defenders and combating torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading
punishment or treatment-, we ask you to: 
-        
Express your support to public institutions and officials in charge of clarifying the serious violations of human rights and breaches of international humanitarian law committed during the
internal armed conflict, so the Guatemala State will fulfill their obligations
to research, identify, prosecute and, as the case may be, sanction those
materially or intellectually responsible;
-        
Participate
as observers in all the public hearings that will
be held during this process and, especially, in the first public hearing to
take place on 21 September 2011, to observe the guarantees of independence,
impartiality and judicial transparency, respect for victim’s rights, the
guarantees of the due process, and so that your presence will act as a
deterrent of possible pressures and threats against those involved in the
process;
-        
Call
on the Guatemalan authorities to provide effective security assurances to
witnesses, lawyers, judges, prosecutors, other judicial officers, and the
relatives of the victims involved in the process;
-        
Promote
a meeting with the Association for Justice and Reconciliation -AJR-
in order to show your support for the efforts to combat impunity, and provide
protective measures, as set out in the guidelines for human rights defenders,
to the surviving victims of genocide and their legal representatives if
requested;
-        
Show that the fight against impunity by all available legal means is a key
element in preventing the recurrence of serious human rights violations such as
genocide and torture, and thus it is important to strengthen the rule of law
and the promotion of present public safety; 
-        
Urge the Guatemalan authorities to adopt
additional measures to combat impunity and prevention of genocide and crimes
against humanity such as the ratification
and implementation of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.



Sincerely,
