Brief description of the situation The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Kyrgyz Committee for Human Rights (KCHR), a member of OMCT SOS-Torture Network, about the alleged torture and ill-treatment of 70-year-old Mr. Vladislav Trusov, by law enforcement agents of Karakol. According to the information received, on 12 February 2009, three policemen entered Mr. Vladislav Trusov’s house allegedly without any reasons. While one was reportedly standing outside nearby the door, another severely beat him on his whole body and strangled him till unconsciousness. They then reportedly threatened him with death and requested documents related to a summer house and money. They eventually took documents away and 800 soms (approx. 20$). On 19 February 2009, Mr. Vladislav Trusov reportedly met with Karakol public prosecutor to denounce the events, following which a medical examination was ordered. However, till this date, the conclusions therein remain unknown. Furthermore, no proper investigation has yet been reportedly launched into these allegations. On 24 February 2009, Mr. Vladislav Trusov was hospitalised in Issyk-Kul regional hospital for further medical treatment. The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned for the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Vladislav Trusov. OMCT recalls that article 7 of the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights, to which Kyrgyzstan is a State Party, states that “[n]o one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment”. OMCT urges the competent authorities of Kyrgyzstan to order carry out a prompt, effective, thorough, independent and impartial investigation into these allegations.
