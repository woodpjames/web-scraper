Brief description of the situation:  The International Secretariat of the OMCT has received information about an assault on Belgian citizen Paul Emile Dupret, assigned in Venezuela by the European Parliament as a political assessor.  He, along with a number of demonstrators, was attacked by the police on 31 July 2002 in front of the Supreme Court of Justice in Caracas.  Mr. Dupret declared in a public statement that has been widely transmitted by the media, that at the time of the events he was accompanying a team from the community television channel Catia-TV, which was covering a demonstration at the Supreme Court of Justice by a number of local citizens who were seeking to express their opinion on the recent coup-d’état that took place on April 11th, 2002.  Mr. Dupret declared that “the metropolitan police of Caracas, in an obvious act of provocation, manoeuvred very swiftly using gratuitous force on the sector of pro-Government demonstrators, who were violently crushed…”  According to his statements, Mr. Dupret received around 40 shot pellet wounds over his body, which, although they have not caused any grave injury, have seriously affected his physical and psychological integrity.  Mr. Dupret has undertaken the necessary legal action with the Public Prosecutor of Venezuela and informed his Embassy in order protest against the police action.  Mr. Dupret also stated that during at least two days following the demonstration, the police deliberately acted against the population “in order to create a state of chaos demonstrating the incapacity of the Chavez Government to enforce calm and order…” He continued to say that numerous people who protested became victims of police aggression (shot wounds, beatings and, according to the family of one victim, torture).  The source confirms that 18 people were injured during the incident of 31 July, but that the number of victims of the events that took place on August 1st and 2nd remains unknown.  The OMCT wishes to express its concern for the human rights situation and for the respect of free speech in Venezuela in general, for the repression of the civil population by Venezuelan authorities and for the physical and psychological integrity of the people involved in the events described above.  Action requested:  Please contact the Venezuelan Authorities urging them to:  ·	take immediate action to guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Paul Emile Dupret and that of the other victims mentioned in the above events; ·	order a thorough and impartial investigation into the circumstances described above, in particular into the reports of police violence, and guarantee that those responsible are brought to trial and that the penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions are applied as provided by law; ·	guarantee the respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms throughout the country, in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards, in particular the right of physical, psychological and moral integrity enshrined in  Article 46, Section 1 of the Constitution of the Bolivian Republic of Venezuela, the right of personal integrity in Article 5 of the American Convention for Human Rights and in the Convention Against Torture, and all other international treaties ratified by Venezuela.
