The International Secretariat of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) requests your URGENT intervention in the following situation in Sudan. Brief description of the situation: The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Sudan Organisation Against Torture (SOAT), a member of the OMCT network, of the recent sentencing to death by stoning of two women by the criminal court of Al-Azazi, Managil province, Gazeera state. According to the information received, the court headed by Judge Hatim Abdurrahman Mohamed Hasan sentenced to death by stoning Ms. Amouna Abdallah Daldoum (23 years old) and Ms. Sadia Idries Fadul (22 years old from Tama tribe, Darfur), on 6 March 2007 and 13 February 2007 respectively, for committing adultery. The two women were charged under article 146 (a) of Sudan’s 1991 Penal Code, which states that “whoever commits the offence of adultery shall be punished with: a) execution by stoning when the offender is married (Muhsan); b) one hundred lashes when the offender is not married (non-muhsan).” It has been reported that Ms. Sadia Idries Fadul does not fully understand Arabic, the language used in Court, and that the man questioned in her case was discharged after denying adultery and due to lack of evidence. Both women sentenced have appealed against the judgment. OMCT expresses its grave concern for the physical and psychological integrity of the two women and recalls that the Government of Sudan, as a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, must protect the right of every individual to life, liberty and security by law and to adopt all appropriate measures, including legislation, to modify and abolish existing law regulations, customs and practices that constitute discrimination against women and/or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Action requested: Please write to the authorities in Sudan urging them to:  Guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of Ms. Amouna Abdallah Daldoum and Ms. Sadia Idries Fadul; Immediately repeal the death sentences passed on Ms. Amouna Abdallah Daldoum and Ms. Sadia Idries Fadul; Ensure they are given a prompt and fair appeal trial in which their procedural rights are guaranteed at all times; Ensure women and girls the right to be free from discrimination, including violence, in line with the international laws and standards; Guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards, such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Sudan is a State Party since 1986.
