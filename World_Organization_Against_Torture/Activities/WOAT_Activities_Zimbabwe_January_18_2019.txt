Intimidation
Zimbabwe
January 18, 2019
 
The Observatory for the Protection of
Human Rights Defenders, a partnership of FIDH and the World Organisation
Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent intervention in the following
situation in Zimbabwe.
 
Description
of the situation:
 
The Observatory has been
informed by reliable sources about the acts of intimidation against  Mr. Okay Machisa, National Executive
Director of the Zimbabwe Human Rights Association (ZimRights), and other
members of the organisation, in a context of repression of a nation-wide
popular protest movement. 
 
According to the
information received, in the night of January 17, 2019, around 20 police
officers in civilian clothes surrounded Mr. Okay Machisa’s house in Harare with
a minibus and two unmarked vehicles, and tried to get Mr. Machisa and his
family out of their home. Mr. Machisa and his family managed to temporarily
leave their house for a safe place and came back home during the night. 
 
Other members and staff of
ZimRights have also faced similar acts of intimidation since the beginning of
the protest movement. Over the last few days, the security forces have been
intimidating on a large scale human rights defenders through acts of
surveillance in relation with their supposed participation in the protest
movement. These acts targeted also members of the organisation who were out of
the country at the time of the protest. These practices have generated a climate
of fear among civil society leading several human rights defenders to go into
hiding.  
 
More generally, the
Observatory denounces the current crackdown on peaceful protesters in Zimbabwe,
which followed President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s announcement that the fuel price
would more than double as the country’s economic crisis is deepening. In
result,  several persons were shot dead
(at least twelve as of the publication of this appeal) or wounded, as well as
around 450 people arbitrarily detained. The Government also blocked access to
the Internet and social media. 
 
The Observatory recalls
that, in relation to the same above-mentioned protests, Pastor Evan Mawarire
has been detained since January 16, 2019 and faces charges of “subverting a
constitutional government”.[1] 
 
The Observatory condemns
the acts of intimidation against Mr. Okay Machisa, his family and other members
of ZimRights, as they seem to be aimed only at punishing them for their
legitimate and peaceful human rights activities. The Observatory urges the
Zimbabwean authorities to immediately end any act of intimidation and
harassment against Mr. Okay Machisa, ZimRights members and all human rights
defenders in the country. 
 
Actions requested:
 
Please write to the
authorities of Zimbabwe asking them to:
 
i. Guarantee in
all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Okay
Machisa, his family, all the members of ZimRights, and all human rights
defenders in Zimbabwe;
 
iii. Put an end to all acts
of intimidation and harassment, including at the judicial level, against Mr.
Okay Machisa, ZimRights’ members and all human rights defenders in
Zimbabwe, and ensure that they are able to carry out their activities
without hindrance;
 
iv. Conform to the
provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the
General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially Articles
1 and 12; and
 
v. Ensure in all
circumstances the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in
accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the international
human rights instruments ratified by Zimbabwe.
