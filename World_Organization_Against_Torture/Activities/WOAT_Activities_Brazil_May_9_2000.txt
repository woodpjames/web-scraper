Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT was informed of the grave confrontations between the police and demonstrators of the Movimiento de los Sin Tierra (the Landless Movement) in Curitiva, State of Paranà, which resulted in the death of Sr. Antonio Tavares Pereira, presumably at the hands of the military police. Many  persons were injured, fifty of whom had to be hospitalized, many were detained and it would appear that some disappeared.   According to reports from various sources, including the Movimento dos Trabalhadores Rurais Sem Terra (Movement of Landless Rural Workers), a member organization of the OMCT network, on May 2nd 2000 demonstrations of peasants and indigenous members of the population took place in various cities throughout the country. In one such event, hundreds of demonstrators of the Landless Movement were making their way peacefully towards the city of  Curitiba to demand title deeds for the property and credits for production when they were stopped by numerous members of the military police, heavily armed, which led to a confrontation with the result described above.   The reports also add that Sr. Antonio Tavares Pereira, aged 30, who was taken to the hospital wounded, died of a bullet wound in the abdomen and that other injured bore traces of fire arms having been used.   The International Secretariat of the OMCT shares the concern at the violence used against the  Movement of the  Landless which fights for the rights of thousands of landless peasants in Brazil.   Action requested   Kindly write to the Brazilian authorities urging them to:  i.	guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of all the detainees and to release them in the absence of juridically valid charges;  ii.	ensure appropriate reparation for the family of Sr. Antonio Tavares Pereira and the persons injured, including adequate and free medical attention;  iii.	carry out a thorough, independent  and impartial investigation into the events dsescribed above in order to clarify them completely, identify those responsible and ensure that the penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions provided by law are applied to them;  iv.	in general act in accordance with the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the regional and international  Pacts and Conventions ratified by Brazil.
