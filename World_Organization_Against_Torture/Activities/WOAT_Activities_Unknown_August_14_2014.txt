Paris-Geneva,
August 14, 2014. The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights
Defenders, a joint programme of FIDH (the International Federation for Human
Rights) and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), welcomes the launch
of the Guidelines on Human Rights Defenders of the OSCE Office for Democratic
Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) on June 10, 2014 under the Swiss
Chairmanship of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE)
in Bern, and calls for a genuine implementation by all OSCE Participating
States.

The OSCE/ODIHR Guidelines on Human
Rights Defenders provide for a solid corpus of recommendations based on
existing international and regional law, standards and practices. They call on
OSCE Participating States to establish human rights defenders' protection
mechanisms both on their territories and in third countries, through their
diplomatic representations.

The fact that the 57 States of the OSCE
are required to implement this text in a similar manner constitutes the best
response to the fallacious arguments brought so far by a number of Eastern
Europe and Central Asia countries on so-called “foreign interference in
internal affairs” with regards to the protection of human rights defenders.
They are also a major progress for the protection of human rights defenders
within the European Union (EU), as they also apply to all EU member-States
nationally, while the already existing EU
Guidelines on Human Rights Defenders were only applying to non-EU
countries.

The Observatory believes that these Guidelines should pave the way for the
development of a human rights defenders' protection mechanism at the OSCE
level, which would be in charge of monitoring the implementation of these
commitments. 

The Observatory contributed to the elaboration of this document through its
participation in an OSCE/ODIHR Advisory Group on the matter, and had released a
position paper with a set of recommendations at the very beginning of the
process in 2013, which is accessible on FIDH and OMCT
websites. A number of FIDH and OMCT member and partner organisations were also
consulted throughout the elaboration of the project.
