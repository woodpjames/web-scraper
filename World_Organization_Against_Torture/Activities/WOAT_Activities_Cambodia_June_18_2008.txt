Description of the situation: The Observatory has been informed by the Cambodian League for the Promotion & Defence of Human Rights (LICADHO) of the judicial harassment faced by Mr. Kong Sam Onn, a human rights lawyer. According to the information received, since April 27, 2009, Mr. Kong Sam Onn has been the subject of a criminal defamation complaint filed against him and a client of his, Ms. Mu Sochua, an opposition Parliamentarian, by Prime Minister Hun Sen. On June 3, 2009, both he and Ms. Mu Sochua were questioned by a Phnom Penh Municipal Court Prosecutor about this complaint. In addition, in relation to the same case, on April 30, 2009, a complaint with the Bar Association of the Kingdom of Cambodia (BAKC) was also lodged against Mr. Kong Sam Onn by the Prime Minister’s lawyer for alleged violation of professional ethics. Possible punishments include suspension or disbarment. The complaints against Mr. Kong Sam Onn followed a press conference held on April 23, 2009 by he and his client, Ms. Mu Sochua, to announce her intention to file a defamation complaint against Prime Minister Hun Sen after the latter had made insulting comments against Ms. Mu Sochua during a public speech in Kampot province. Ms. Mu Sochua, elected Member of Parliament from Kampot province, has criticised the executive on several occasions. Ms. Mu Sochua’s complaint against the Prime Minister was filed with the Municipal Court on April 27 by Mr. Kong Sam Onn. On June 10, 2009, the defamation complaint against the Prime Minister was dismissed by the Prosecutor. However, the court continues to proceed in its investigation of the Prime Minister’s defamation complaint against Mr. Kong Sam Onn and Ms. Mu Sochua. The court has requested the lifting of Ms. Mu Sochua’s parliamentary immunity, which would clear the way for Mr. Kong Sam Onn and her to be charged and placed on trial. The issue is expected to be put to a vote of Cambodia’s National Assembly on June 19 or 22. Meanwhile, on June 16, the Bar Council of the Cambodian Bar Association decided to proceed with a disciplinary hearing of Mr. Kong Sam Onn for alleged violations of professional ethics. A date for the hearing has not yet been finalised. The accusations against him relate to his participation in the April 23 press conference with Ms. Mu Sochua in which he publicly defended her legal interests. The Observatory believes that Mr. Kong Sam Onn is targeted because of his action for the defence of the rights of his client who has been in particular a vocal critic of land grabbing issues in the province. Moreover, since 2005, the Observatory notes with concern an increase in the harassment and threats faced by human rights defenders, including journalists and lawyers. The Observatory urges the Cambodian authorities to withdraw the complaints lodged against Mr. Kong Sam Onn. Action requested:   Please write to the Cambodian authorities and the Bar Association of the Kingdom of Cambodia and specify that:   Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Kong Sam Onn.
