According to the information received, the above seven traveled from Khartoum, in a private car, to Kajabar area, but were detained by the security in Dongola. They reportedly spent the whole night in a security office. In the morning they were interrogated again on the reason of their coming traveling to Kajabar. The journalists and the lawyers were forced to switch off their mobiles. They are reportedly currently still in detention. According to the same information, on 14 June 2007, the security forces in Khartoum detained a further five people, in connection with the same incident of Kajabar dam demonstrations. The Nubians in Khartoum were having a protest demonstration against the killing of their people in Northern Sudan. Security forces reportedly raided the house of a Nubian family, at mid-night on 14 June 2007, searching for a Nubian activist who had spoken on the same day to the BBC radio on the issue of Kajabar killings. He was not there at the time they raided the house but they reportedly arrested five persons present in the house. They detained them and took them into a security house at St. 57 Amarat – Khartoum, where they were subjected to interrogation and investigation on their relation to the Nubian Movement and the Anti- Kajabar Dam Committee. Among the five detainees was reportedly SOAT’s lawyers network member Mr. Yasir Mohamed Salih (42 years old- lawyer) who happened to be in the house that night. Mr. Yasir Mohamed Salih and other two detainees, namely Mr. Abdulkareem Makki Abdulkareem, a 22 years old student and Mr. Faisal Abdulrahman Nasr, a 48 years old private sector employee, were released on 15 June 2007 at 6:00 am. Two others persons remain detained namely Mr. Ahmed Rumrum, a 40 years old lawyer and Mr. Raafat Hasan Abass, a 40 years old private sector employee. The International Secretariat of OMCT expresses its deep concern regarding the excessive use of force by the Sudanese security officers during the demonstration in Farraig which lead to the death of four individuals and injured nine others.
