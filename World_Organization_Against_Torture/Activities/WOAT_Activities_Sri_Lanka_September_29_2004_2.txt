Brief Description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by The Asian Human Rights Commission (AHRC), a member of the OMCT network, of the arbitrary arrest and torture of Mr. Heeralu Mohottalalage Punchi  Banda (39) on 26 August 2004.   According to the information received, on 26 August 2004 at 4:30 p.m. the victim was dragged out of his house by Sub Inspector Dhammica Bandara and Police Sergeant Mahinda of Samanalaweva Police Post. He was hit violently on the head and kicked all over his body by the Sub Inspector who was accusing him of having caused fatal injuries to a villager using a local trap gun. While being ill-treated, the Sub Inspector questioned him about the place of the gun. Since the victim stated that he is unaware where the location of the gun is, the Sub-Inspector struck his head many times with a wooden pole, then wound a nylon rope around his neck and pulled on the rope until his neck bled. Then the Sub Inspector tied the victim’s hands and took him to the jungle to search for the gun. After a one kilometer walk in the jungle and with the gun not being found, the victim was taken to the Samanalaweva Police Post at 8:30 p.m.   According to the information provided, at the police post the victim was kept handcuffed to a table leg until 6:30 a.m. of the next day (August 27) without being  provided medical care. Later in the day, Sub Inspector Dhammica Bandara took him to Oluganthota Government Hospital, instructing him beforehand that he should tell the doctor that the injury on his neck was caused accidentally by a tree branch. In the hospital, the Sub Inspector himself recounted such a story to the doctor, not allowing the victim to speak. The doctor filled in a form and gave it to the Sub Inspector without examining or questioning the victim.   The Samanalaweva Police Post reportedly charged the victim with causing fatal injuries to a villager by a trap gun. Mr. Punchi Banda denied the offence with which he was charged. On the same day he was brought before Balangoda Magistrate Court and was remanded in custody. In Balangoda Prison the victim’s statement about the police assault was recorded by the prison authorities. On 28 August 2004, after having received 100 Rs. from the victim’s sister the prison authorities allowed first aid to be given to him. He was then taken to Kuruwita Prison where a doctor examined him. Following this examination he was sent to the prison hospital where he was under treatment until 8 September 2004.   On 10 September 2004 Mr. Punchi Banda was taken to the Balangoda Magistrate Court for the second time. The Court released him on bail. After his release the victim was still suffering from severe pain in his head, neck and chest. Due to his suffereing, he was hospitalized in Ratnapura General Hospital, from where he was discharged on 15 September 2004.   The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned by this case of arbitrary arrest and torture. OMCT calls on the authorities to launch a prompt, thorough and impartial investigation into these events, in order to identify those responsible and bring them to justice and award adequate reparation to Mr. Punchi Banda.
