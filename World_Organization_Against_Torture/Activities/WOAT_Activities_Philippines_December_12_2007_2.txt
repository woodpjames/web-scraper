Brief description of the situation The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Alliance for the Advancement of Peoples’ Rights (KARAPATAN), a member of the OMCT SOS-Torture network, about the alleged extra-judicial killing of Mr. Regolo A. Moran, a 56-year-old municipal vice mayor, resident of Brgy Banahao, Dimasalang, Masbate, in Dimasalang Masbate, on 7 December 2007. According to the information received, on 7 December 2007, at around 3:30 p.m., Mr. Regolo A. Moran returned to his office, which is located at the ground floor of the municipal hall, from the municipal council session held at the second floor of the building, when two men wearing ski masks armed with handguns, allegedly elements of the 9th Infantry Battalion Philippine Army (IBPA) under the command of 1st Lt. Beronia, entered the room and started shooting him. Mr. Regolo A. Moran reportedly wrestled with one of the gunmen but the other one shot him. The perpetrators reportedly fled on board of a motorcycle. Mr. Regolo A. Moran sustained three gunshot wounds and later died on the way to the Masbate Colleges Hospital, a two hours drive from Dimasalang.  According to the same information, Ms. Riza Asarez, the vice mayor’s secretary, and Mr. Ruel Afable, an employee at the vice mayor’s office, were also wounded during the shooting. No investigation was reportedly launched into this event. According to the information, Mr. Regolo A. Moran condemned on several occasions the spate of killings and other human rights violations in the province allegedly perpetrated by the military. He was reportedly scheduled to participate in the International Human Rights Day rally in the province on 10 December 2007 as part of the negotiating team of the mobilisation. Prior to his death, Mr. Regolo A. Moran reportedly complained that elements of the 9th Infantry Battalion Philippine Army under the command of 1st Lt. Beronia were constantly "inviting" him. The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned about the alleged extra-judicial killing of Mr. Regolo A. Moran by elements of the IBPA. OMCT calls on the authorities to order a prompt, thorough and impartial investigation into the circumstances of this extra-judicial killing, in order to identify those responsible, bring them to trial and apply the penal and/or administrative sanctions as provided by law.
