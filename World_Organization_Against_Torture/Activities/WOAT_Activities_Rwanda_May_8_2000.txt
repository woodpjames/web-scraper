Brief description of the situation  The Observatory has just been informed by the youth organization, “Collectif des Organisations et Associations des Jeunes du Sud Kivu”  (COJESKI) , of the arrest of Bruno Bahati Barhalibiru, a citizen of the Democratic Republic of Congo, a member of COJESKI, of the Association "Ensemble Pour la Défense des Droits de l'Homme" (EDDH),  and other non-governmental organizations in South Kivu, Democratic Republic of Congo.  According to the information received,  Mr. Bahati Barhalibiru  was arrested on April 22nd 2000 at the frontier post of Katuna, (the border between Rwanda and Uganda), as he was going to Bukavu where he lives, after having taken part in the National Consultation organized in Kinshasa by the Heads of the Religious Faiths.  According to the same information, Mr. Bahati Barhalibiru was transferred to Kigali, Rwanda,  to the detention centre of the Gikondo Gendarmerie, where it is alleged he was a victim of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. Although the reasons for his detention remain unknown, it would appear that the name of Mr. Bahati Barhalibiru had been on a list of persons to be arrested for several days  The Observatory fears for the physical and moral integrity of Mr. Bahati Barhalibiru. It also considers that the arrest and detention of Mr. Bahati Barhalibiru is merely the consequence of the military involvement of Rwanda in the Democratic Republic of Congo  and the continuation of the harassment policy aimed at human rights defenders in the region of Kivu.   Action requested  Please write to the Rwandan authorities urging them to:  i.	ensure the immediate release of Bruno Bahati Barhalibiru and to guarantee his physical and psychological integrity as well as to ensure all necessary conditions to enable him to return to his home  in complete safety;  ii.	put an end to every type of harassment carried out against human rights defenders on the territory under their jurisdiction;  iii.	abide by the provisions of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders adopted by the General Assembly of the UN on December 9th  1998, in particular Article l, according to which "everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels";  iv.	to conform generally with the provisions of the  Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the international and regional pacts by which Rwanda is bound.
