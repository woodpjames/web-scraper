New information The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Russian-Chechen Friendship Society (RCFS), a member of OMCT SOS-Torture Network, that Mr. Zubajr Isaevich Zubajraev’s whereabouts still remain unclear more than one month after he was taken from penitentiary colony ЯР-154/15 (also known as LIU-125 prison hospital) in Volgograd, Southern Russia, to be transferred to a high security prison following a court ruling on 12 May 2009. His lawyer believes that he is being moved to Krasnojarsk (about 4000km from Volgograd) but he has still not been provided with precise information on Mr. Zubajraev’s new place of detention. According to the latest information received, on 21 May 2009, Mr. Zubajr Isaevich Zubajraev was brought to the hospital ward of SIZO-1 in Ekaterinburg (which is located on the way to Krasnojarsk) after he was allegedly severely beaten in the train convoy. He had reportedly remained there until 2 June 2009 when he was put back on the train. Since then, his whereabouts have again remained unclear. The OMCT International Secretariat is seriously concerned about the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Zubajr Isaevich Zubajraev and regrets the lack of information as to his whereabouts raising fear for his safety. OMCT wishes to recall that it condemns his transfer to a high security prison as it seems exclusively motivated by a wish to punish him following the allegations of torture and other forms of ill-treatment (see background information)[1]. OMCT fears that Mr. Zubajraev will be further isolated as it will be become very difficult for his family and lawyer to visit him. OMCT therefore repeats its calls on the competent Russian authorities to guarantee his safety at all times, to refrain from transferring him to a high security prison, and to carry out a prompt, effective, thorough, independent and impartial investigation into the allegations of torture and other forms of ill-treatment, in order to bring those responsible before a competent, independent and impartial tribunal and apply penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions as provided by law. OMCT recalls the absolute prohibition of torture and other forms of ill-treatment and recalls article 11 of the UN Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment stipulating that, “Each State Party shall keep under systematic review interrogation rules, instructions, methods and practices as well as arrangements for the custody and treatment of persons subjected to any form of arrest, detention or imprisonment in any territory under its jurisdiction, with a view to preventing any cases of torture”. Background information In August 2007, Mr. Zubajr Isaevich Zubajraev, a 30-year-old man from Chechnya, was sentenced to five years in prison and sent to prison colony IAR- 154/25 in Frolovo, Volgograd region, where he was allegedly tortured by prison colony officers throughout the period he was held there. The acts of torture included severe beatings, also with full plastic bottles, electroshocks, injection of unknown substances, nailing to the ground and having to stand in the snow with bear feet. On several occasions he was also placed in a punishment cell. Following complaints about Mr. Zubajr Isaevich Zubajraev’s situation, he was reportedly admitted to the prison hospital (penitentiary colony ЯР-154/15) in February 2008. However, according to the information submitted, instead of receiving adequate medical care and treatment, he was again subjected to torture and other forms of ill-treatment, including beatings, allegedly by the chief of the penitentiary colony and his deputy. Mr. Zubajr Isaevich Zubajraev was also reportedly threatened with psychiatric internment. In November 2008, the Volgograd regional prosecutor inspected the prison hospital but reportedly found no fault with the prison authorities. According to the same information received, on 23 April 2008, Mr. Zubajr Isaevich Zubajraev’s lawyer saw numerous signs of beatings on his body when he came to visit him, including numerous bruises in the area of the chest, on the shoulders and on the low part of the back. The lawyer stated that he immediately demanded that a doctor and a chief of the LIU-15 be called, which was refused by the penitentiary administration. Mr. Zubajraev said he had been beaten twice, on 10 and 12 April 2009. Subsequently, a closed court hearing took place on 12 May 2009 at the request of the prison administration in order to consider whether to place Mr. Zubajr Isaevich Zubajraev in stricter conditions of imprisonment. The prison administration justified this hearing on the basis of two claims: firstly, Mr. Zubajraev was accused of having kept “banned” pain-killers, which is contested by Mr. Zubajraev’s lawyer, and secondly, he would have quarrelled with another inmate, although the latter did not file any report or complaint about the alleged quarrel. Furthermore, OMCT recalls that this hearing occurred on the same day as the hearing of one of Mr. Zubajraev’s lawyer, Ms. Elena Maglevannaya, who is being prosecuted by the administration of Volgograd prison colony LIU-15 for “honour and business reputation protection” (Article 152 of the Russian Civil Code)[2]. According to the same information, his family has also received threats, including by a Federal Security Service (FSB) officer, for having denounced his conditions on several occasions. OMCT continues to fear for the family’s safety. Finally, Mr. Zubajr Isaevich Zubajraev’s health remains reportedly extremely poor and, due to several head injuries, he might be suffering from epilepsy. Moreover, he would have several wounds on his leg that do not heal.
