Abduction / Incommunicado detention / 
Fear for psychological and physical integrity
Syria
May 16, 2011
 
The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights
Defenders, a joint programme of the International Federation for Human Rights
(FIDH) and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent
intervention in the following situation in Syria.
 
Description of the situation: 
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources
about the abduction and incommunicado detention of Ms.
Catherine Altalli, a lawyer and human right defender who has been involved since 2007 in the defence of numerous political
prisoners before Syrian courts. 
 
According to the information received, on May 13,
2011, at around 4 pm, Ms. Catherine Altalli was
forced out of a minibus in Barzeh, Damascus, by members of the security forces who
arrested her and brought her to an unknown destination. Since then, no
information could be obtained on her whereabouts and condition.
 
The Observatory is deeply concerned by Ms. Catherine
Altalli's abduction and incommunicado detention, which seem to merely aim at sanctioning her human rights activities, and fears for her physical and psychological integrity amid the current general crackdown against peaceful protesters by army and security forces in Syria since March 16, 2011. The Observatory calls
upon the Syrian authorities to take prompt action in order to disclose Ms.
Catherine Altalli’s whereabouts and release her immediately. 
 
The Observatory further calls upon the Syrian authorities
to take prompt action in order to immediately and unconditionally release all
human rights defenders presently detained in the country.
 
Actions requested:
 
Please write to the Syrian authorities, urging them
to: 
 
i. Guarantee in all circumstances the
physical and psychological integrity of Ms.
Catherine Altalli;
 
ii. Take prompt action in order to
disclose the whereabouts of Ms. Catherine Altalli and immediate and unconditionally release her, as it seems to merely
aim at sanctioning her human rights activities;
 
iii. Put an end to any acts
of harassment and intimidation against all human rights defenders in Syria; 
 
iv. Conform with the provisions of the
UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of
the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially: 
-         
its Article 1, which states that
“everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to
promote and to strive for the protection and realization of human rights and
fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”;
-         
its Article 6 (b) and (c), which
states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with
others […] as provided for in human rights and other applicable international
instruments, freely to publish, impart or disseminate to others views,
information and knowledge on all human rights and fundamental freedoms and
[...] to study, discuss, form and hold opinions on the observance, both in law
and in practice, of all human rights and fundamental freedoms and, through
these and other appropriate means, to draw public attention to those matters”;
-         
and its Article 12.2, which provides
that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by
the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with
others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse
discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his
or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present
Declaration”;
 
v. Ensure in all circumstances respect
for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international
human rights standards and international instruments ratified by the Syrian
Arab Republic.
