Dear EU Ministers of Foreign Affairs, 
 
We, the 90 undersigned organizations dedicated
to the promotion of universal human rights and/or the fight against corruption,
write to voice our strong support for the Foreign Affairs Council to initiate a
process aimed at establishing an EU-wide program for the imposition of targeted
sanctions on individuals and entities deemed responsible for serious human rights
violations. Noting that the Foreign Affairs  Council will  take up this  matter on December 10, 2018 — the 70th anniversary of the  adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights— we urge all state representatives to honor the Declaration by
supporting action on such a sanctions regime, and, in so doing, beginning the
process of providing the EU with an additional, critical tool to combat
impunity and defend human rights worldwide.
 
Today more than ever, we recognize that the
promotion and protection of equal and inalienable rights form the basis of
justice, peace, and security. Where human rights are violated and corruption is
allowed to flourish, individuals are less safe and communities are less stable
and secure. With universal human rights and the rule of law under significant
challenge globally, now is thus an opportune moment to take an unmistakable
step forward in defense of our common values.
 
As we have seen in countries that have enacted
and utilized “Global Magnitsky” sanctions laws to date, a global human rights
and anti-corruption sanctions program can serve as a vital addition to the
diplomatic and legal toolkit essential to upholding human rights and the rule
of law. In a relatively short period of time, governments such as those in the
United States and Canada have used their human rights and anti-corruption
sanctions laws to fight impunity for some of 
the world’s most heinous crimes in countries
from Myanmar to Saudi Arabia. A similar tool will provide the EU with the
ability to shine a spotlight on and compel changes of behavior in some of the
world’s worst human rights violators. Robust implementation also has the
potential to deter would-be kleptocrats and those that would use violence to
silence dissent and maintain their grip on power.
 
We applaud the Dutch government for its
demonstrated commitment toward achieving a global human rights sanctions
program. We also commend those other EU governments that have voiced their
support for this effort and encourage in the strongest terms all other EU
member states to likewise support the initiative on December 10.
 
Sincerely,
