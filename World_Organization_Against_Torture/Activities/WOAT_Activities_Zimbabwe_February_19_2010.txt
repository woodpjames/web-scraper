The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in Zimbabwe.
Description of the situation:
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the threats received by Mr. Okay Machisa, Executive Director of the Zimbabwe Human Rights Association (ZIMRIGHTS), an organisation which carries out, in particular, intensive civic education in the communities and campaigning on the right of people to be involved in the drafting of the new Constitution, as well as board member of the Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum.
According to the information received, on February 16, 2010, Mr. Machisa received by email an anonymous message warning him to be careful with his work. The message said “Be careful my friend a number of people at my workplace have been assigned to bring you down. I refused to be involved. Be careful especially at your home“.
The Observatory recalls that Mr. Machisa has already been victim of acts of intimidation in the past. On November 2009, several armed men waited at his home's gate as he returned from a meeting. They left after Mr. Machisa alerted the police and colleagues.
The Observatory expresses its deepest concern about these threats against Mr. Machisa, which seem to merely aim at silencing him due to his human rights activities.
Actions requested:
Please write to the authorities of Zimbabwe asking them to:

 Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Okay Machisa as well as all human rights defenders in the country;
 Order an immediate, thorough, effective and impartial investigation into these threats, the result of which must be made public, in order to identify all those responsible, bring them before a civil competent and impartial tribunal and apply to them the penal sanctions provided by the law;
 Put an end to any kind of intimidation against Mr. Machisa as well as against all human rights defenders in Zimbabwe;
 Conform with the provisions of the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, and Article 12.2, which provides that the State shall “take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of his or her rights”;
 More generally, ensure in all circumstances the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with international and regional human rights instruments ratified by Zimbabwe.
