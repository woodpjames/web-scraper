The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in India.
Description of the situation:
The Observatory has been informed by People’s Watch about the arbitrary detention, judicial harassment and ill-treatments against Mr. Devi Singh Rawat, a human rights lawyer in the Ajmer District of the North Indian State of Rajasthan[1].
According to the information received, in the night of January 31, 2010, Mr. Devi Singh Rawat was arrested and accused of “voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from his duty” and “assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty” (Sections 332 and 353 of the Indian Penal Code), as well as “mischief causing damage to public property” (Section 3 of the Public Property Damages Act). He was accused of allegedly participating in a fight between villagers and police personnel that occurred the same day around 11.00 am during the Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRI) local elections (local body elections) in Palra Village, which is under the jurisdiction of the Adarsh Nagar police station. A dozen villagers were also arrested.
However, at the time of the confrontation between villagers and police on January 31, 2010, Mr. Singh was not at the place of the incident. Moreover, he is resident of an area that comes under the Ajmer Municipal Council limits, with no stake in the above-mentioned elections.
During their detention, Mr. Devi Singh Rawat and the other villagers who were arrested were forced by the police to remove their clothes, following which they were photographed. The pictures were then made available to the press. 
On January 5, 2010, Mr. Devi Singh Rawat had filed a case for torture in the court of Judicial Magistrate No. 4 against officials of the Adarsh Nagar police station, on the request of People’s Watch National Project on Prevention of Torture. On January 30, 2010, the police officials tried to persuade Mr. Singh Rawat for a compromise, threatening him that otherwise he would have to face dire consequences. However, Mr. Singh Rawat refused to withdraw the case.
After the Judicial Magistrate No 5 rejected on February 1, 2010 the bail plea and remanded Mr. Devi Singh Rawat and the 15 other apprehended persons to judicial custody until February 11, a bail application on behalf of Mr. Devi Singh Rawat was filed on the same day before the District and Sessions Judge under Section 439 of the Criminal Procedure Code, and the hearing was fixed for February 2, 2010. On that day, Mr. Devi Singh Rawat was granted bail. At about 6.30 pm, he was released from Central Prison, Ajmer, pending charges against him, along with the 15 other arrestees in this case. A hearing is scheduled to take place on February 11, 2010.
The Observatory denounces the above-mentioned acts against Mr. Devi Singh Rawat, which seem to merely aim at sanctioning his human rights activities, in particular his work against torture, and therefore urges the Indian authorities to put an end to the ongoing detention, judicial harassment and ill-treatments against him. 
Actions requested:
Please write to the authorities of India, urging them to:

 Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Devi Singh Rawat as well as of all human rights defenders in India;
 Put an end to all acts of harassment - including at the judicial level - against Mr. Devi Singh Rawat as well as against all human rights defenders in India so that they are able to carry out their work without hindrances;
 Comply with all the provisions of the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, in particular with its Article 1, which provides that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, as well as with Article 12.2 (“the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”);
 More generally, ensure in all circumstances the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with international and regional human rights instruments ratified by India.
