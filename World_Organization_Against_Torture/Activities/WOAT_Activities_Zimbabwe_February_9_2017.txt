The bail is accompanied by the obligation to report twice a week (on Mondays and Fridays) to the Arondale police station. In addition, Pastor Mawarire had to surrender his passport to the Clerk of the Harare Magistrates Court and was urged not to interfere with State witnesses. The next hearing is scheduled on February 17, 2017. Furthermore, the High Court found extensive periods of pre-trial detention to be in contradiction with provisions of the Zimbabwean Constitution, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights as well as with opinions of the United Nations Human Rights Committee, and the European Court of Justice. On February 1, 2017, upon his return to the country after a period living in the United States (US), Pastor Mawarire was charged by the Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) with “subverting a constitutional government”[3] (see background information). The Observatory condemns the ongoing judicial harassment against Pastor Mawarire,which seems only to be aimed at sanctioning his legitimate human rights activities and urges authorities to immediately drop all charges pending against him. Background information In July 2016, Pastor Mawarire was arrested and charged with “inciting public violence”. The public prosecutor then altered the charges to “attempting to overthrow a constitutional government”. However, the Harare Magistrate Vakai Chikwekwe ruled that ZRP officers had violated his constitutional rights in arresting and detaining him and that the prosecutor acted in violation of the Constitution by bringing new charges against Pastor Mawarire while in court. President Mugabe himself publicly attacked Pastor Mawarire accusing him of being a “great shame” and a “disgrace” for “allowing himself to demonstrate against the country”. Fearing to be further harassed and arrested, Pastor Mawarire, left on a self-imposed exile to the US for seven months. Pastor Mawarire returned to Zimbabwe on February 1, 2017 and was immediately arrested at the airport and charged by the ZRP with “subverting a constitutional government”. The ZRP claims that the cleric has been “inciting Zimbabweans from all walks of life either locally or internationally to revolt and overthrow a constitutionally elected government”. That includes allegations that Pastor Evan Mawarire has incited some Zimbabweans living in the US and “all over the world” through social media to converge in New York on September 22, 2016 to “confront” President Mugabe, who was attending the United Nations General Assembly and order him to “immediately” resign from his position under the accusation of destroying the country. Actions requested: Please write to the Zimbabwean authorities asking them to:i.               Put an end to any kind of harassment - including at the judicial level - against Pastor Evan Mawarire, as well as against all human rights defenders in Zimbabwe;ii.              Put an end to any kind of hindrance to Pastor Evan Mawarire’s freedom of movement by immediately returning him his passport;iii.            Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, in particular with its Articles 1, 6, 9, and 12.2;iv.             Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by Zimbabwe. Addresses: ·       President of Zimbabwe, Mr. Robert G.
