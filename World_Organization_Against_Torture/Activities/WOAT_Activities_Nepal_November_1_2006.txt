Brief description of the situation: The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by reliable sources including by the Informal Sector Service (INSEC), a member of the OMCT network, of the torture and subsequent death in detention of Mr. Manoj Das (35), Indian national, by police officers on 16 October 2006 in Nepal. According to the information received, Mr. Manoj Das was arrested by police officers on 15 October 2006 at around 3.00pm and detained in Janasewa Police Office, New Road Kathmandu based on allegations of theft. At around 8.00pm, Assistant Police Inspector Narayan Pandit and Police Inspector Surendra Adhikari reportedly started to beat Mr. Manoj Das following instructions and in the presence of Inspector Nanti Raj Gurung, chief of the Janasewa Police Office, to extract a confession. According to the information received, Mr. Manoj Das was repeatedly beaten on his sole with a plastic pipe and was forced to walk on the ground. He was allegedly subjected to torture until 1.00am on 16 October 2006. According to Mr. Arun Das, who was arrested and detained along with Mr. Manoj Das, the victim went three times to the toilet during the night. At around 6.45am, he was brought to Bir Hospital by police officers where he was declared dead. On 17 October 2006, a fact finding team, composed among others by a representative of INSEC, met with Inspector Nanti Raj Gurung and inquired about the case. Moreover, on the same date, a team of forensic experts conducted a post mortem examination on the body of Mr. Manoj Das. According to its findings, the cause of the victim’s death was multiple blunt force injury on his body. The International Secretariat of OMCT expresses its deep concern over the torture resulting in the death of Mr. Manoj Das and fears of torture of Mr. Arun Das who is reportedly currently detained in District Police Office, Hanuman Dhoka.
