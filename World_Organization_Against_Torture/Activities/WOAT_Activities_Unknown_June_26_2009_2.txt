It shows that violence can be reduced and eliminated by addressing those root causes. 2008 was the second year of a three-year OMCT project entitled “Preventing torture and other forms of violence by acting on their economic, social and cultural root causes 2007 – 2009” that has five principal areas of activity: Working with NGOs to reinforce their capacity for action; Bringing about change through action files and other forms of intervention; Using the UN Treaty Bodies and other mechanisms to bring about change; Working with the European Union; Building a framework of understanding through advocacy.
