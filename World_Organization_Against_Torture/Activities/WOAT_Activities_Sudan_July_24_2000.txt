Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT has received information confirmed by the Sudanese Victims of Torture Group (SVTG), a member of the OMCT network, that Salah Eldeen Khalil Abdel Majid and Mohamed Abdeen Rahaman were arrested by officials working for Amjad Corporation.  They were reportedly detained and subjected to torture in Amjad Corporation premises in Khartoum from July 13th 2000 until July 15th 2000.  A medical report for Salah Eldeen Khalil Abdel Majid indicated internal bleeding in his skin.  This is attributed to being lashed with coated wires and cables.  According to the information received, both were arrested by Atif Abdel Rahaman Kasir, Ali Ahmed Ali, Ahmed Salih and others, against whom an official complaint, with the Attorney General’s Office of Central Khartoum, has been made by both victims.  On 17th July 2000, Salah Eldeen, accompanied by Advocate Ghazi Suliman, also informed the State Minister of Justice and the Trustee General of the Human Rights Advisory Counsel at the Ministry of Justice of these incidents.  The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned for the physical and psychological integrity of these two men and more importantly, that a new torture center in Khartoum exists.  Action requested  Please write to the authorities in Sudan urging them to:  i.	take all necessary measures to guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of Salah Eldeen Khalil Abdel Majid and Mohamed Abdeen Rahaman; ii.	guarantee an immediate investigation into their detention and alleged torture, identify those responsible, bring them before a civil competent and impartial tribunal and apply the penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions provided by law; iii.	guarantee adequate restitution, compensation and rehabilitation to all injured people; iv.	guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
