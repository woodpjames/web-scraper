URGENT APPEAL - THE
OBSERVATORY

Release
Egypt
August 1, 2017

The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a
partnership of FIDH and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), has
received new information and requests your urgent intervention in the following
situation in Egypt. 

New information:

The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the release of Mr. Tarek Hussein (known as Tito), human
rights activist and lawyer at the Egyptian Center for Economic and Social
Rights (ECESR)[1].
 
According
to the information received, on July 27, 2017, Mr. Tarek Hussein was released
from El-Khanqa Police Station, following the duly payment of a 2,000 EGP
(approx. 99 euros) bail, which had been issued by the "Khanqa"
prosecution on June 18, 2017, although not implemented until now (see
background information).
 
Mr.
Tarek Hussein was arbitrarily arrested on June 17, 2017, under accusations of
“joining an illegal organization” and “calling for a protest” (see background
information). The police held Mr. Tarek Hussein incommunicado, preventing his
family and lawyers to visit him.
 
Following
his enforced disappearance while in detention, Mr. Tarek Hussein’s family
and lawyers as well as the  Lawyers’
Syndicate filed three successive complaints regarding the various violations
suffered by Mr. Tarek Hussein in detention[2].

 
In
an attempt to justify his detention, the authorities claimed that at least 13
verdicts had been issued all over the country against an individual named
"Tarek Hussein", and in one of the cases, police claimed he was
sentenced for “stealing electricity in 1993”, the year when the human rights
defender was born. During the nearly 40 days of illegal detention, his lawyers
submitted documentation and evidence with different authorities and police
stations to prove that he was not the "Tarek Hussein" in question.
 
The
Observatory welcomes the release of Mr. Tarek Hussein, but expresses its
concerns over the judicial harassment ongoing against him and other human
rights defenders in Egypt. Accordingly, the Observatory calls upon Egyptian
authorities to put an end to all kind of harassment against human rights
defenders, as it only aims at sanctioning their legitimate human rights activities.
 
The
Observatory calls upon the Egyptian authorities to investigate all human rights
violations suffered by Mr. Tarek Hussein in detention.
 
Background
information:
 
On
June 17, 2017, at dawn fifteen masked and plain clothes officers from the Central
Security Forces stormed out Mr. Tarek Hussein’s house, arrested him and
confiscated his laptop and cell phone. During his arrest, Mr. Tarek Hussein
requested to see the arrest warrant but was not shown any and was physically
and verbally assaulted instead, including upon his arrival at Al-Khanka’s
police station. He was subsequently brought before the Al-Khanka District
Prosecution, where he was accused of “joining an illegal organization” and
“calling for a protest”.
 
On
June 18, 2017, the Al-Khanka District Prosecution ordered Mr. Tarek Hussein’s
release on bail, which has been paid. However, he remained detained.
 
On
July 4, 2017, Mr. Tarek Hussein who had been detained at Ain El-Shams Police
Station since June 20, 2017, was set to be transferred to Imbaba Police
Station. However, Imbaba Police Station denied Mr. Tarek Hussein’s presence
within their premises.
 
On
July 6, 2017, the Prison Authority told Mr. Tarek Hussein’s family he was not
being held in
any
of their facilities, but refused to provide written proof of this.
 
On
July 5, 2017 the Lawyers’ Syndicate filed a complaint against the Minister of
Interior regarding the various violations of Mr. Tarek Hussein’s rights. 
 
On
July 6, 2017, Mr. Tarek Hussein’s family submitted a complaint before the
National Council for Human Rights. No formal, written response to any of the
complaints submitted by the family or the Syndicate have been received to date
from the Interior Ministry. At least one newspaper article quoted an anonymous
Ministry of Interior source stating that Mr. Tarek Hussein would be held until
authorities were able to fully confirm that he was not implicated in any other
cases.
 
On
July 9, 2017, authorities reported that Mr. Tarek Hussein was held at Giza
Central Prison.
Following
the announcement, Mr. Tarek Hussein’s family went to Giza Central Prison to see
him
but the prison’s administration denied his family a visit and did not provide
his lawyer or
family
any reason for his detention. In addition, they were given Mr. Tarek Hussein’s clothes,
torn
apart.
 
In
addition, allegations of ill-treatment including physical and verbal assault
were reported while in detention. It has been reported that Mr. Tarek Hussein
was detained in poor conditions which include sharing an overcrowded cell with
eighty co-detainees, and was denied food and changing clothes for two
consecutive days. Mr. Hussein’s relatives, who were in contact with the
prison’s authorities, were told that “he deserves to die”.
 
Mr.
Tarek Hussein’s arrest and arbitrary detention occurred amidst protest over
Tiran and Sanafir islands’ transfer to Saudi Arabia, which he has been vocally
opposing[3]
.
