Brief description of the situation: The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the arbitrary detention of Mrs. Umida Niyazova, a human rights defender and journalist who used to work at the Uzbek office of the international NGOs Internews and Freedom House and played an active role in many international human rights and social projects in Uzbekistan. According to the information received, on January 22, 2007, Mrs. Umida Niyazova was arrested after she had met  her lawyer in Tashkent. She was kept in the pre-trial detention unit in Andijan until January 26, 2007, when she was transferred to the Tashkent Transport Prosecutor’s Office, which launched a criminal case against her on January 28, 2007, on charges of “illegally crossing the border” (Article 233 of the Uzbek Penal Code) and “importing banned materials / smuggling” (Article 246). She faces from three to ten years in prison. Later on, Mrs. Umida Niyazova was additionally charged with “collecting and distributing material threatening the public security” (Article 244 of the Penal Code). According to the latest information received, Mrs. Umida Niyazova was transferred to the Tashkent prison’s investigation ward n°1, were she remains detained. These arrest and proceedings follow her previous arrest, on December 21, 2006, as Mrs. Niyazova was arriving from Bishkek (Kyrgyzstan), at Tashkent airport. Indeed, she was shortly arrested after that customs officers and a staff member of the Uzbek Press and Information Agency’s Monitoring Department examined her laptop and declared that it contained material of an “anti-constitutional” and “religious” nature. This material was relating to the Andijan massacre in May 2005 and contained in particular interviews with witnesses and victims of the massacre. Reportedly, the woman could also be accused of belonging to the radical Islamist movement Akramia. After more than nine hours of detention, Mrs. Umida Niyazova was allowed to go back home but her passport, laptop and flash-card were confiscated. She was also asked not to leave Tashkent and to cooperate with the investigation. On the grounds of the materials confiscated, the Tashkent City Customs Department launched an administrative case against Mrs. Niyazova. On January 22, 2007, her lawyer had convinced her that this administrative case had been dropped and that she could collect her belongings and passport. The Observatory is deeply concerned about the arbitrary detention of Mrs. Umida Niyazova, and fears for her physical and psychological integrity. The Observatory considers her detention, which appears to be aimed at sanctioning her human rights activities, as arbitrary and urges the Uzbek government to release her immediately. Actions required: Please write to the Uzbek authorities urging them to:  Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mrs. Umida Niyazova; Release Mrs. Umida Niyazova immediately and unconditionally since her detention is arbitrary; Put an end to all acts of harassment against Mrs. Umida Niyazova as well as all other human rights defenders in Uzbekistan; Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels” and article 12.2, which states that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”; Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by Uzbekistan.
