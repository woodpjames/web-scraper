 ‘Defending
victims of torture - from documentation to legal action’
 
The World
Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) held on November 19, 20, 2011, a first of a
series of workshops on international standards and procedures on the
prohibition of torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment
or punishment.
The workshop targeted young
activists, human rights lawyers and magistrates working in collaboration of
leading civil society organizations in Tunis and in the
regions. It focused on the role of international standards within the process
of transition in Tunisia, the scope of
the international prohibition of torture and the legal requirements under the
UN Convention Against Torture, as well as on the practical challenges in using
international standards within domestic and international litigation.
The training which was
conducted by Ibrahima Kane (Senegal – leading human
rights lawyer with the Open Society Foundation) and Georges Assaf (Lebanon – member of the
OMCT General Assembly) introduced also concepts of strategic litigation in
relation to torture and discussed the scope of legal and judicial reforms to
make international standards a direct part of the transition process in Tunisia.
The OMCT had
opened its first ever field office on September
 1, 2011.  Its
activities are part of a broader program in Tunisia accompanying
OMCT’s partner organizations in the transition process, providing expert advice
on anti-torture reforms and supporting efforts to strengthen accountability and
the legal and institutional framework for the prevention of torture. Earlier
this year the OMCT was able to conduct a high-level mission on the reform
process and conducting an independent inspection of the prison system of the
country (see press
statement).
 
 
The
OMCT wishes to thank the Federal Republic of Germany for its support to this
training.
