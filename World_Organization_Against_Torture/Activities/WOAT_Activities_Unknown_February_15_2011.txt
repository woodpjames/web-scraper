for candidates for the mandate of the UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion
and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering
terrorism
In June 2011 at the 17th session
of the United Nations Human Rights Council, the President of the Council is to
appoint an independent human rights expert to serve as the next Special
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental
freedoms while countering terrorism.
The
following checklist is intended as an interpretive aid for the requirements set
out in Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 and decision 6/102.
Amnesty
International, the Association
for the Prevention of Torture, Human Rights Watch, International
Commission of Jurists, and the World Organisation Against Torture call on Governments, NGOs
and others, including relevant professional networks, to use this checklist to
identify eligible candidates for consideration for the upcoming vacancy for the
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and
fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism.
Our
organizations urge Governments to call publicly for candidates, e.g. through
media advertisement, and consult civil society nationally before nominating
candidates. 
NGOs and
others wishing to nominate candidates should, after checking with the person(s)
concerned, send the names of eligible candidates to the Office of the High
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) byMonday 14 March 2011 for inclusion in the
list used as a basis for the appointment. Further information on vacancies for Special Procedures mandate-holders to be
filled in June 2011 can be found here
or by going to the Special Procedures extranet via the Human Rights Council
extranet, linked from OHCHR website (www.ohchr.org).
While the organisations proposing these criteria
consider commitment to universal human rights, relevant experience and
competence, and personal integrity to be obligatory requirements for any
individual to become an eligible candidate for this mandate, the organizations do not consider that a
mandate holder must meet each and every specification in the checklists below. However, the
strongest candidates should meet a substantial number of them. These checklists
are not intended to be exhaustive. 
Prospective mandate holders
should be aware that this is a voluntary, unpaid role. Reasonable expenses for
mandate related work will be paid, but no salary is available. It will require
a substantial time commitment from the individual, including readiness to
travel and respond to urgent situations, as explained in the checklist. 
Checklist
for selection of candidates for the mandate of UN Special Rapporteur on the
promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while
countering terrorism
Proposed candidates for the
mandate should be put forward on the basis of technical, professional and other

Human Rights Council (HRC)

nominating, selecting and appointing mandate-holders: (a) expertise; (b)
experience in the field of the mandate; (c) independence; (d) impartiality;
(e) personal integrity; and (f) objectivity.’ 
HRC decision 6/102 establishes
