The court dropped the charge of “destruction of evidence” due to a lack of evidence. If convicted of the remaining charge, Mr. Ven Vorn could face up to five years of imprisonment.Mr. Ven Vorn has been arbitrarily detained since October 7, 2015 at the Koh Kong provincial prison. He is due to appear again before the Koh Kong Provincial Court on March 3, 2016, when a verdict is expected.The Observatory strongly condemns the arbitrary detention of and judicial harassment against Mr. Ven Vorn, which only aims at sanctioning his legitimate human rights activities, and calls on the Cambodian authorities to release him immediately and unconditionally.Background information :On September 2, 2015, 17 persons, including Mr. Ven Vorn, were arrested outside Koh Kong Provincial Court. They were picketing to demand the release of the three jailed activists, Messrs. Sim Samnang, Tri Sovichea, and Sun Mala who had also been involved in protests against a hydroelectric dam (see below)[1]. Mr. Ven Vorn was subsequently released.On October 7, 2015, at around 12.20 p.m., Mr. Ven Vorn was rearrested and sent to Koh Kong provincial prison. The arrest followed the decision of Investigating Judge Mr. Min Makara, who had questioned Mr. Ven Vorn the same morning and charged him with “harvesting timber products and/or non-timber forest products without a permit” (Article 98 of the Forestry Law) and “destruction of evidence” (Article 533 of the Criminal Code).Both of the above-mentioned charges relate to the construction by Mr. Vorn and a group of local activists of a small visitor centre and community meeting place for local activists involved in a campaign against the proposed construction of a hydropower dam in the Areng Valley. According to activists and environmental groups, the hydropower dam poses a threat to their land, livelihood, and the natural environment. For this project, Mr. Vorn and others had purchased approximately 10 cubic metres of wood from a vendor in 2014, which authorities claimed had been procured by the vendor through illegal logging.Mr. Ven Vorn had been previously questioned on April 3, 2015 at the Koh Kong Provincial Court in relation to the same alleged illegal logging incident before being released on the same day.Actions requested:Please write to the authorities of Cambodia asking them to:i.

Release Mr. Ven Vorn immediately and unconditionally since his detention is arbitrary as it only aims at sanctioning his human rights activities;iii.
