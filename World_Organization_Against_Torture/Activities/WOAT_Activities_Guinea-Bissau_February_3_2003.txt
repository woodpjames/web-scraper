Brief description of the situation:  The Observatory has been informed by the Guinean League of Human  Rights, of the arrest and detention of its Vice-president, Mr. Joao  Vas Mane on January 29, 2003, based on an order delivered by the  security services.  According to the information received, on January 28, 2003, Mr. Mane,  who was taking part in a Bombolon radio show, "Palavers of Peace",  allegedly accused President Kumba Yala to have mobilized funds for  the pilgrims trip to the Mecca for political and personal ends when  civil servants of the State have not been paid in 4 to 7 months.  In a clandestine interview given to the Portuguese radio, Mr. Mane  said not to have been in contact with his family or with his lawyer  since his arrest. On January 30, at 1:00  in the morning, he was  taken out of his prison cell to be questioned until 4:00 in the  morning.   To this date, Mr. Joao Vas Mane is held incommunicado and has still  not been presented before the judge.  The Observatory notes that these facts occur in a context of  radicalisation of the governmental policy since the dissolution of  the Parliament on November 16, 2002 and followed by the announcement  of anticipated legislative elections next April 20. This  radicalisation results particularly in the arrest and detention of  opponents, censorship in the media, systematic restrictions on the  freedom of movement imposed to opponents and members of civil  society, violent speeches and the denigration by the authorities of  all independent voices, in particular of human rights organizations,   Action requested:  Please write to the authorities of Guinea-Bissau urging them to:  i. Immediately release Mr. Joao Vas Mane in the absence of charges  against him;   ii. Guarantee in all circumstances the physical integrity of Mr. Mane  and put an end to any form of harassment against human rights  defenders in Guinea-Bissau;  iii. Conform to the provisions of the Declaration on Humans Rights  Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on  December 9, 1998, in particular article 1, which states that  "everyone has the right, individually or in association with others,  to promote the protection and realization of human rights and  fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels";  iv. Conform to the provisions of the Universal Declaration on Human  Rights and international instruments relating to Human Rights which  bind Guinea-Bissau;  Addresses:  President Kumba Yala C/o Prime Minister's Office tel/fax: 00245 20 62 06 or 00 245 20 62 05  or National Assembly fax: 00245 20 11 72  Paris - Geneva, 3 February 2003  Kindly inform the Observatory of any action undertaken quoting the  code number of this appeal in your reply.
