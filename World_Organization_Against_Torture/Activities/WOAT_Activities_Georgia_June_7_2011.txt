Concern for continued disrespect of the right to freedom
of peaceful assembly and use of violence
against demonstrators
The Human Rights House
Foundation (HRHF), the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), the
World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and the Norwegian Helsinki Committee (NHC) condemn the
excessive use of force by the police against
peaceful anti-government protest in Tbilisi on the night of 26 May 2011. Our
organisations are concerned that this is yet another example of the lack of respect of the right to freedom of
peaceful assembly by the Georgian authorities. Previous peaceful protests
held on 3 January and 25 March 2011were also
violently dispersed by police.
The undersigned organisations have during the
last few years received documentation on violent dispersal of peaceful protests
that demonstrate that Georgia does not respect its international commitments
nor the Constitutional provision on the right to freedom of peaceful assembly
and freedom of expression. 
Amendments to the Georgian Law on Assembly and
Manifestations introduced in July 2009 restrict the right to assemble in front
of official buildings and set a more burdensome procedure to receive an
authorisation. Since then, several cases have demonstrated a negative impact of
the amendments on the right to freedom of assembly.
Most recently, on 25 and 26 May 2011, hundreds of opposition supporters
gathered in front of the Parliament building at Rustaveli Avenue in Tbilisi and
were violently dispersed when their rally permit expired at midnight. According
to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgia, 8 policemen, one journalist and
27 civilians were injured while 105 persons were arrested. According to the human rights organization,
Human Rights Center (HRIDC), leading the OSCE Freedom of Assembly Monitoring
Project in Georgia, 17 journalists were injured and several detained. The
Public Defender Office of Georgia reported that 152 persons were arrested and
that “the police used disproportionate force (…), the law-enforcement officials
damaged the equipments of journalists and verbally and physically assaulted
them”. Furthermore, some of those
detained were reportedly beaten in custody and not given the possibility to
communicate with their relatives and lawyers. Many were transferred several
times to different temporary detentions without further notice to their
respective families or lawyers raising fears about their safety. According to
the Georgian human rights organization Union “Article 42 of the Constitution”,
dozens of protesters are still missing.
Our organisations are deeply concerned about the aforementioned events and
urges Georgia to immediately disclose the whereabouts of the dozens protesters
who are still missing and to fully implement the recommendations formulated by
the Council of Europe ´ Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT) after its
visit in February 2010. CPT called upon the Georgian authorities to to ensure that the right to have access to a lawyer is fully
effective for all detained persons, and that the right to be examined by an
independent doctor is guaranteed[1].   
These incidents illustrate that Georgia,
as a member of the Council of Europe, does not comply with its international,
as well as national human rights obligations. It committed itself to
protect and promote human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the rights
to freedom of expression and to freedom of peaceful assembly and association,
established in Articles 10 and 11 of the European Convention for the Protection
of Human Rights and Fundamental Rights (ECHR). The same rights are protected by
Article 7 of the Georgian Constitution. 
Georgia has yet to accept the recommendation
106.52 of the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) made by the Czech Republic at the
17th session of the United Nations Human Rights Council in June
2011, (to “review the July 2009 Law on Assemblies and
Manifestations imposing several restrictions on the right to assembly and to
demonstrate in order to ensure free and unhampered enjoyment of this
right.”),In light of the recent events, the necessity to accept, this particular recommendations in order to fight
violent repression of demonstrations by police agents in Georgia, is urgent. 
Concerned about the situation, we call upon the Georgian authorities:
·        
To ensure and respect the rights to freedom of
peaceful assembly and freedom of expression, provided in the ECHR and the Georgian Constitution;
·        
To issue clear
instructions to the security forces to refrain from using excessive force
against the protestors in accordance with international standards, including
the Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms and the Code of Conduct
for Law Enforcement Officials ; 
·        
To immediately release the detained
and imprisoned peaceful demonstrators and to cancel all administrative charges
and fines against those who participated in the peaceful assembly on 25 and 26
May 2011; 
·        
To launch an immediate, thorough, and impartial
investigation into the excessive use of force, alleged ill-treatment of protesters
in custody and bring those found responsible for these violations to justice ; 
·        
To provide
the victims with adequate compensation, reparation and
rehabilitation; According to contravention of the ECHR (Article 5
§ 5 ), the state of Georgia is obliged to provide compensation to every
detainee for the ungrounded arrest or detention; 
·        
To take effective measures to prevent ill-treatment, including by
ensuring that any individual arrested is promptly brought before a judge, has
immediate access upon arrest to (1) a lawyer of his/her choosing, (2) an
independent medical doctor and (3) visits by the family; any arrested persons
should also at all times have the right to inform third parties about the
detention; 
·        
To amend the Law on Assembly and
Manifestations to make it comply with their international human rights
obligations.
