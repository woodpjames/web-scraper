Brief description of the situation  The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders has been informed by the International Institute for Human Rights, Environment and Development (INHURED) that on January 17th 2001, Mr Gopal Siwakoti ‘Chintan’, Executive Director of INHURED International, human rights lawyer and environmental activist was physically assaulted.  According to the information received, on January 17th evening around 7:00 pm, he was called by a stranger to pick up a packet from America for his son Nitanta. A female voice told him that it was her brother who had brought this packet and that they wanted to deliver it to him as it was very urgent. He was told to come out in the street around 8:35 as they reportedly did not know where he lived. Mr Gopal Siwakoti waited for about 15 minutes at the main road at the cross section of Kalikasthan and Anamnagar which is near the office of INHURED International.  According to him, no one showed up until 8:55 or so and he was thinking of coming back. All of a sudden, he was hit from behind and knocked unconscious. When he woke up in the main road, and no one was there.  He could not move as he was badly hurt.   15 minutes later he was helped to the INHURED office gate, about 20 meters from the incident, by two passers by who stated that they had seen three people running away.  Mr Gopal Siwakoti was later taken to Kathmandu Model Hospital by co-workers.  As soon as he was admitted to the Emergency Unit of this private hospital, the doctor on duty informed the police of the incident and asked them whether they would come as per the rule and prepare a police report. However, the police completely ignored the call and told Mr Gopal Siwakoti and his co-workers that the should directly report the incident to the police in office when the medical treatment was finished.  He was discharged on January 18, 2001 – the following day.   He is now being treated on a regular basis at B & B Hospital. He is taking complete rest for at least another six weeks. He has a big wound at the back of his head. His nose is broken. There are several little wounds on his face and other parts of the body. His right knee is seriously fractured. He cannot walk but can read and write.  Regarding legal action, the Firsthand Information Report (FIR) was filed on January 18th evening in local police station with all the details but as of today there is no response or inquiry into the matter. Several human rights groups have called upon the government for the immediate investigation of the incident and take appropriate legal action.    The Observatory is gravely concerned by the lack of response on behalf of the police into the assault of Mr Gopal Siwakoti.
