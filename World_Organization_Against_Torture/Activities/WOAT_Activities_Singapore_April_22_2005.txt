Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Asian Centre for the Progress of Peoples (Hotline Asia), a member of the OMCT network, of the case of Mr. Shanmugam Murugesu, 38 years old, who is due to be hanged on or before the first week of May 2005.  According to the information received, Mr. Shanmugam was arrested on 29 August 2003 at Tuas Checkpoint, for trafficking about one kilogramme of cannabis into Singapore. He was prosecuted under section 7 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, Chapter 185, and sentenced to death after trial at the High Court in April 2004. Mr. Shanmugam’s appeal was heard in the Court of Appeal, but dismissed on 26 October 2006.    In Singapore, the death sentence is mandatory for drug offences, and the presidential clemency is the final mechanism for appeal. Information about the precise date of hanging is not made public.  The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned for the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Shanmugam Murugesu, and stresses that it is strongly opposed to the death penalty, particularly when administered automatically for such offences. OMCT emphasises that it considers the capital punishment an extreme form of cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment, as proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international human rights instruments. OMCT therefore urges the authorities in Singapore to immediately commute the death sentence of Mr. Shanmugam Murugesu.   Action requested : Please write to the authorities in Singapore urging them to:  i.	take all necessary measures to guarantee Mr. Shanmugam Murugesu’s physical and psychological integrity;  ii.	immediately commute Mr. Shanmugam Murugesu’s death sentence;  iii.	guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
