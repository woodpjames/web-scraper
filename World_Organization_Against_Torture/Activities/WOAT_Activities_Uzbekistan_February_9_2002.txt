New Information:  The Observatory has been informed by the Human Rights Society of Uzbekistan (HRSU), that on 27 August 2002, Ms. Elena Urlayeva, a member of HRSU, was arrested during a demonstration in front of the Ministry of Justice in Tashkent as she was protesting against the decision taken by the Tashkent City Court on 29 July 2002. The Court ruled that Ms. Urlayeva should receive again a forced treatment in a psychiatric hospital. On 28 August she was placed in the Psychiatric Hospital of Tashkent.  On April 6, 2001, as Ms. Urlayeva was going to attend a human rights meeting near Hokimiyat. she was illegally detained by militiamen in plain clothes and transferred to a psychiatric hospital. On 7 April, a consilium of psychiatrists examined Ms. Urlayeva and declared she suffered from continuously current schizophrenia, a paranoid syndrome.  On 10 April 2001, the interdistrict court of Mirabad district decided the compulsory hospitalization of Ms. Urlayeva. According to the reports received, Ms Urlayeva did not benefit from a fair trial. For instance, she was not notified the day of the hearing. It would also seem that the Court only considered superficially the case and did not investigate the reasons for placing Ms Urlayeva in a psychiatric hospital.   Ms. Urlayeva was kept in a psychiatric hospital for 60 days where she had to take a medical treatment of neuroleptics, seriously affecting her health. Although Ms. Urlayeva was finally released, the case was brought again before the Court. On 5th June 2002, the interdistrict court of Mirabad district decided the prolongation of the period of compulsory treatment. Ms. Urlayeva filed an appeal before the Tashkent City Court which on the 29th of July 2002, confirmed the previous decision of the Mirabad district court.  The Observatory is very concerned by Ms. Urlayeva physical and psychological integrity and fears that this arrest and practices are only motivated by the human rights activities of Ms Urlayeva. It recalls that Ms. Urlayeva has already been arrested several times and has been the victim of  numerous acts of intimidation. On 19th February 2001, Ms. Urlayeva, was arrested in Saylgoh Square, Tashkent and the documents in her possession such as human rights publications as well as her passport were confiscated (See Observatory Urgent Appeal UZB/002/0201/OBS 015). In the night of the 8-9 March, 2001, Ms. Urlayeva’s apartment was sprinkled with petrol. On 6 November she was arrested again by the militia in the parliament building after filing a complaint with the Ombdusman. (see Observatory UZB/002/0201/OBS 015.01 and 2001 Annual Report). She was suspected of carrying a dangerous powder in an envelope which after an analysis was revealed as non dangerous. She was released on 14 November after being subjected to very strong psychological pressure.   Actions requested:  Please write to the authorities of  Uzbekistan urging them to :   i.	Proceed to Ms Urlayeva immediate release in the absence of any charges against her, and guarantee her physical and psychological integrity in all circumstances;  ii.
