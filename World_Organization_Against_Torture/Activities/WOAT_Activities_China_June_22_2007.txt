New information:  The Observatory has been informed by Chinese Human Rights Defenders (CRD) about acts of ill-treatment at the instigation of prison guards against Mr. Chen Guangcheng, lawyer involved in denouncing the extensive use of violence by the authorities of Linyi in relation to birth planning policies.  According to the information received, on June 16, 2007, some guards of the Liyni City Prison (Shandong Province) obliged six prisoners to beat Mr. Chen Guangcheng after he refused to have his head shaved. When his wife visited him on June 19, 2007, he told her that he had pains in his ribs and that he feared to have a broken rib. His wife, Ms. Yuan Weijing, protested to the guards about the mistreatment and demanded that the prison immediately arrange for Mr. Chen to be sent to a hospital for a check-up, including an x-ray of his ribs, which the authorities refused.  Mr. Chen said he was punished for “being disobedient” due to his insistence on filing an appeal to the provincial higher court for a review of the verdict in his case. Since Mr. Chen has been blind since infancy, he requires the assistance of his lawyer or his wife to write down what he would dictate, but his lawyers and his wife have been denied the right to visit him longer than the normal half-an-hour long, which has made it impossible to prepare an appeal for Mr. Chen.  Indeed, the Observatory recalls that Mr. Chen Guangcheng remains detained since March 11, 2006, and that he was sentenced to four years’ and three months’ imprisonment for “organising a mob to disrupt traffic” on August 24, 2006 (See background information).  The Observatory expresses its deepest concern about Mr. Chen’s arbitrary detention, these acts of ill-treatment as well as the systematic denial of the prison guards to allow Mr. Chen to seek for legal assistance and fears these actions only aim at depriving him from having his case reviewed.   Furthermore, the Observatory wishes to recall that the National People’s Congress amended the Chinese Constitution in 2004 to include that “the State respects and safeguards human rights” and that in April 2006, China submitted a document to the UN in order to support its candidacy to the Human Rights Council’s first election , in which it affirmed that the amendment to the Constitution was aiming at “defining the position of human rights in the overall national development strategy”. The Observatory further wishes to point out that, as a member of the Human Rights Council, China “shall uphold the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights” . Background information:   On March 11, 2006, Mr. Chen Guangcheng was arrested with other militants by local police officers for “disturbing traffic”. It is only on June 11, 2006 that his wife was informed by the Yinan PSB that her husband was charged with “deliberate destruction of property” and “organising a mob to disrupt traffic”.  Before he was arrested, Mr. Chen had been campaigning against the Linyi city authorities’ recurrent use of violence for the implementation of the Government birth quotas. Starting in April 2005, Chen and his wife, Yuan Weijing, began to investigate villagers’ claims that Linyi City authorities were employing extensive violence, and to put together briefs for lawsuits against officials involved. Their work represented one of the first-known domestic effort to challenge the use of violence in the enforcement of China’s population policy.  On June 19, 2006, the authorities banned a press conference in Beijing that called on the international community to denounce Mr. Chen’s situation. The organisers of the conference were interrogated and put under surveillance. Mr. Chen’s family was also subjected to repeated acts of harassment.  The first hearing in his case, scheduled for July 20, 2006, was finally postponed until August 18, 2006 by the Linnan County People’s Court in Shandong Province.  On August 24, 2006, Mr. Guangcheng was sentenced to four years’ and three months’ imprisonment, without his lawyers being allowed inside the hearing room. His trial only lasted two hours.  On October 31, 2006, the Court of Appeal ordered the review of Mr. Chen’s case.  On November 27, 2006, the new proceedings against Mr. Chen took place before the People’s Court of Yinan Canton and lasted ten hours. His lawyers, his wife and his mother were allowed to attend the hearing.  On December 1, 2006, the Court sentenced Mr. Chen to four years and three months in prison for “intentionally disrupting traffic” and “inciting material destruction”.  On December 8, 2006, Mr. Chen’s lawyer appealed the decision to the Intermediary Court of Linyi City.
