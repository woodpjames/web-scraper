Open Letter concerning the arbitrary arrest and
incommunicado detentions of Dr Amin Mekki
Medani, Mr Farouq Abu Eissa, and Dr Farah Ibrahim
Mohamed Alagar by the Government of
Sudan
 
Dear Ms Alapini-Gansou, Ms Tlakula, Mr Mute, Mr Forst,
Mr Kaye, Mr Nononsi ,Mr Andenas and Mr
Mendez,
 
The African Centre for Justice and Peace Studies,
Bahrain Center for Human Rights, the Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies, the
Darfur Bar Association, the East and Horn of Africa Human Rights Defenders
Project, Human Rights Watch, the International Federation for Human Rights, the
International Refugee Rights Initiative, Journalists for Human Rights, the
Moroccan Human Rights Organisation, REDRESS, the Sudanese Human Rights Monitor
and the World Organisation against Torture are writing to urge you to act upon
our request to call upon the Government of Sudan to release the human rights lawyer
Dr Amin Mekki Medani and activists Mr Farouq Abu Eissa and Dr
Farah Ibrahim Mohamed Alagar without charge from Sudanese National
Intelligence and Security Services’ (NISS) custody. As outlined further below,
their detentions are thought to be connected solely to the peaceful expression
of their beliefs in favour of democratic principles and peace and security in
Sudan, in violation of the lawful exercise of their rights guaranteed under
Sudan’s Interim National Constitution (INC), the African Charter on Human and
Peoples’ Rights (ACHPR), and the International Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights (ICCPR).
 
We are sending this letter to you in your capacities
as Special Procedure mandate holders as it
engages your respective mandates. We are aware of the
UN High Commissioner for Human Rights’
public statement of 12 December 2014 urging the
Government of Sudan to “release the three men
in the absence of valid legal charges or promptly
charge them with a recognizable offence and bring
them before a judge with guarantees of their fair
trial rights.” Notwithstanding the OHCHR’s call, all
three men remain in incommunicado detention. They
continue being denied visits from their
families and lawyers and their continued detention
raises serious concerns for their health and
safety.
 
Both Dr Medani and Mr Abu Eissa are in their seventies
and have specific medical needs as both are
diabetic. Dr Medani has high blood pressure and NISS
prevented him from taking his medication
with him upon arrest. Mr Eissa suffers from cyanosis.
The families of both men have sought to
provide them with food, also given their health
condition and dietary requirements, but the NISS
officials refused to receive it.
 
Our organisations are unaware of any criminal charges
filed against Dr. Medani, Mr. Eissa, or Dr.
Alagar as of 18 December 2014.
 
The arbitrary arrest and incommunicado detention of
Dr. Medani, Mr. Eissa, and Dr. Alagar by the
Government of Sudan is in violation of their right to
liberty, freedom of expression, and the rights
and freedoms guaranteed to human rights defenders. The
circumstances of their detention also
raise concerns over the right to be free from
ill-treatment or torture. In light of the urgency of the
situation, we respectfully request you to urgently
undertake the following actions: 
 
1.    
Publicly call upon the
Government of Sudan to immediately release Dr Amin Mekki Medani, Mr Eissa, and
Dr Alagar in the absence of valid charges against them, to disclose their whereabouts
and grant access to their family members and a lawyer of choosing, to guarantee
their safety, and to grant them any medical assistance they may require. 
2.     Publicly call upon the Government of Sudan to unconditionally
guarantee Dr Medani, Mr Eissa, and Dr Alagar’s rights under the ACHPR and ICCPR.
3.    
Publicly declare that the detentions
constitute a violation of the right to freedom of expression, as protected by
Article 9 of the ACHPR, Article 19 of the ICCPR and Article 19 of the UDHR, and
the protection enjoyed by detainees as set out in the UN Declaration on Human
Rights Defenders.
 
Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any
questions or if we can provide you with any
additional information you may need.
 
Yours sincerely,

Background
 
Just before midnight on 6 December 2014, the
Government of Sudan’s NISS arrested two prominent
public figures on their return from political
negotiations held in Addis Ababa between Sudanese
political and armed opposition groups. A large number
of personnel from the NISS, arriving in six
vehicles, arrested Dr Amin Mekki Medani, (m),
75 years of age, and Mr Farouq Abu Eissa, (m), 78
years of age, from their homes in Khartoum. Although
their families were not informed of the
reasons for the arrests, the men were detained after
signing the “Sudan Call” on 3 December in
Addis Ababa.
 
The “Sudan Call” is a declaration that commits
signatories to work towards the end of the conflicts
raging in different regions of Sudan. The document
also pledges to work towards legal, institutional
and economic reforms. Dr Amin Mekki Medani signed the
document on behalf of a group of civil
society actors. Mr Farouq Abu Eissa signed on behalf
of the Sudanese National Consensus Forces –
an umbrella of political opposition parties – in his
capacity as Chairperson of that group.
 
In the early hours of Sunday, 7 December, Dr Farah
Ibrahim Mohamed Alagar, (m), 60 years of age,
was arrested by the NISS from his home in Alfitihab
neighbourhood of Omdurman. Dr Alagar had
also attended the Sudan Call negotiations in Addis
Ababa but had not signed the resulting document.
Around 10 members of the NISS reportedly arrived at
his home at 1am and took him to their offices
in Khartoum Bahri without providing reasons for his
arrest.
 
These arrests come following a pattern of detentions –
and prosecutions - that appear aimed at
silencing any form of criticism of the policies of the
ruling party. The past six months have seen
scores of political and youth activists, as well as
prominent human rights defenders, detained. These
cases raise serious concerns about increasing
restrictions on freedom of expression, association and
assembly in Sudan.
 
Dr Medani is a prolific member of the Sudanese human
rights movement. He was the Chairperson of
the organisation Sudanese Human Rights Monitor, FIDH
member organisation in the country, and is
currently an Executive Board member of over six
non-governmental human rights organizations and
legal associations. Dr Medani has also worked for
various international organisations including as the
head of the OHCHR in the West Bank, Gaza and Croatia
and as a legal adviser to the Special
Representative of the U.N. Secretary-General in Iraq
and Afghanistan.
 
Mr Farouq Abu Eissa is the Chairperson of the National
Consensus Forces, an umbrella of political
opposition groups in Sudan, and has a long history of
political activism. He has been one of the most
preeminent voices in calls by Sudan’s opposition
parties for democratic transformation in Sudan.
He is the former Secretary General of the Arab
Lawyers’ Union and the National Democratic Alliance.
 
Dr Alagar is a retired officer from the Sudan Armed
Forces and was formally the chairperson of the
National Congress Party (NCP) in Blue Nile state. He
was dismissed from the ruling party in
December 2012, reportedly because he expressed views
diverging from the official NCP line,
including on the possibility of power sharing in Blue
Nile state between the NCP and Sudan Peoples’
Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-N). He was later
engaged in April 2014 as an independent
conflict resolution expert by the SPLM-N to attend
ongoing peace talks in Addis between the SPLM-N
and the Government of Sudan.
