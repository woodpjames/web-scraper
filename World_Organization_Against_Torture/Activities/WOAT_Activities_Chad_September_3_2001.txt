Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by a reliable source that on 22 July 2001 the Deputy-Commander of the Gendarmerie in the Gounou-Gaya Region (formerly known as the Mayo-Kebbi prefecture) allegedly arbitrarily arrested, detained and carried out beatings upon the family members of a suspected thief.  The suspect, Haman Gongong, is accused of having stolen a radio, two boxes of pharmaceutical products and a carpet.  According to the information received, the Deputy-Commander systematically assaulted several members of the Gongong family, causing serious injury. In particular, Zara, Haman’s mother, lost four of her teeth as a result of the beating.  The family members, 12 people all together, were arbitrarily held for 10 days at the headquarters of the Brigade. On 2 August, they were transferred to the Gounou-Gaya prison, where they are still being held without trial.   Moreover, according to the information, the Deputy-Commander also systematically looted the property of Gongong's relatives, including eight cattle belonging to the father of the accused.
