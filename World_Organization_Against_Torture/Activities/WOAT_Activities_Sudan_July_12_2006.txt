According to the information received, Ms. Aisa Mohammed Elnaseem Eltahir, a housewife and mother of two children who was arrested whilst being at home, was brought to the police custody centre in Tendelti city, 80 km from Kosti. There she was questioned by an officer who introduced himself as Lieutenant Tamem about the whereabouts of her uncle, Mr. Adam. Ms. Eltahir informed the officer that she had no knowledge of the whereabouts of her uncle. On the same day, 14 June 2006, at 10.00 am, PIF officer Waleed brought Ms. Elthahir from the police custody centre to the PIF offices, situated in a different section of the building.   It is reported that Ms. Eltahir was subjected to severe torture whilst being in the PIF office. The PIF officers interogated Ms. Eltahir and ordered her to confess that she had witnessed her uncle murdering a stranger, which she refused. The name of the person murdered was not provided by the PIF officers. Following her refusal to confess to have witnessed the alleged murder, PIF officer Waleed and a second Officer named Galal, in the presence of Officer Elsanwse Abutalib and Officer Mohammed Dod, tied her hands and legs. The officers then inserted a stick between her legs and used the stick to hang Ms. Eltahir upside down between two chairs. Ms. Eltahir was then blindfolded and the officers proceeded to lash her feet with a water hosepipe for approximately 30 minutes. After the lashing, the officers’ untied Ms. Eltahir’s legs and ordered her to walk and jump, which she was unable to do due to the injuries on her feet sustained from the lashing. Following this, the officers removed her blindfold, and ordered Ms. Eltahir again to confess to have witnessed her uncle murdering the stranger, which she refused again. The officers then placed Ms. Eltahir on her back on the floor after which Officer Galal produced a bottle containing chilli sauce and threatened to pour the contents inside her genitals if she did not confess.   According to the information received, at 14:00 pm on 14 June 2006, the PIF officers took Ms. Eltahir back into police custody where she remained in detention. The following day, 15 June 2006, Ms. Eltahir was transferred to the PIF office for the second time where she was again subjected to torture and threatened. The officers beat Ms. Eltahir’s back with a stick. On Friday, 16 June 2006, Ms Eltahir was released on bail. Currently no charges are held against her.  It is reported that Ms. Eltahir’s husband took her to the Attorney General’s office in Kosti to file an assault complaint on 17 June 2006. The Attorney General’s office issued a Form 8 to Ms. Eltahir before referring her to Kosti hospital. At the hospital, the doctors confirmed that injuries on Ms. Eltahir’s hips, feet and back were consistent with severe lashing. SOAT’s Lawyer Network in Kosti is providing legal aid to Ms. Eltahir.
