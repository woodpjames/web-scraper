Incommunicado detention /
Fear for psychological and physical integrity
Syrian Arab Republic
December 6, 2011
 
The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint 
programme of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World 
Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent intervention on the 
following situation in Syria.
 
Background information:
 
The Observatory has been informed by the Syrian Center for Media and 
Freedom of Expression (SCM) of the arrest and incommunicado detention of Ms. 
Razan Ghazzawi, blogger and SCM Media Officer.
 
According to the information received, on December 4, 2011, Syrian 
immigration police at Syria/Jordan border arrested Ms. Razan Ghazzawi, while she 
was heading to Amman, Jordan, to attend the Forum of Defenders and Media Freedom 
in the Arab World as the representative of the SCM. No information could be 
obtained as to her current place of detention.
 
The Observatory is deeply concerned with the arrest and incommunicado 
detention of Ms. Ghazzawi, and fears for her physical and psychological 
integrity. The Observatory calls upon the Syrian authorities to take prompt 
action in order to disclose the fate and whereabouts of Ms. Ghazzawi and release 
her immediately as her arrest seems to merely aim at sanctioning her human 
rights activities. 
 
Actions requested:
 
Please write to the Syrian authorities, urging them 
to:
 
i. Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological 
integrity of Ms. Razan Ghazzawi;
 
ii. Take prompt action in order to disclose the fate and whereabouts of 
Ms. Ghazzawi and release her immediately and unconditionally, as her arrest 
seems to merely aim at sanctioning her human rights 
activities;
 
iii. Order an immediate, thorough, effective and impartial investigation 
into the above-mentioned facts, the result of which must be made public, in 
order to identify all those responsible, bring them before a civil competent and 
impartial tribunal and apply to them the penal sanctions provided by the 
law;
 
iv. Put an end to any kind of harassment against Ms. Razan Ghazzawi and all human rights defenders in 
Syria;
 
v. Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights 
Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 
1998, especially:
-     its Article 1, which states 
that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to 
promote and to strive for the protection and realization of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms at the national and international 
levels”;
-     its Article 5 (a), which 
states that “for the purpose of promoting and protecting human rights and 
fundamental freedoms, everyone has the right, individually and in association 
with others, at the national and international levels to meet or assemble 
peacefully”;
-     and its Article 12.2, 
which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the 
protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in 
association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or 
de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a 
consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the 
present Declaration”;
 
vi. Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental 
freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and 
international instruments ratified by the Syrian Arab 
Republic.
