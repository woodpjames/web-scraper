Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Asian Human Rights Commission, a member of the OMCT network, and other reliable sources, about an ordinance that will go before the Bangladeshi Parliament on January 26th, 2003, which will enable the perpetrators of massive human rights violations under Operation Clean Heart to enjoy total impunity in Bangladesh.  According to the information received, as the result of the Joint Drive Indemnity Ordinance, which has been created by Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia's Government at a time when the deadly and controversial anti-crime drive known as Operation Clean Heart is scaling down, as many as fifty thousand Bangladeshi troops may receive immunity from prosecution and thereby be reprieved of responsibility for torture and other human rights abuses, including the deaths of as many as 44 detainees. OMCT previously denounced the violent repression that has been taking place under Operation Clean Heart, which lasted from October 16, 2002 to January 9, 2003, in its initial, large scale deployment phase (please see Press Release: Bangladesh: Operation Clean Heart results in over 3,000 arrests and the death of 10 people as a result of torture and Cases BGD 041102 and BGD 041102.1 on our website: www.omct.org).    If the ordinance is passed when it goes before Parliament on January 26, 2003, dozens of pending criminal cases filed against the troops by victims or their families may be automatically dismissed and no further cases could reportedly then be filed concerning the widespread human rights violations which are alleged to have occurred during the operation.  According to the information received, Prime Minister Zia deployed the Army in October to help the police and civilian administration after she and her government were criticized for a severe rise in murder, extortion, kidnappings, lynchings and crimes against women by gangs linked to ruling and opposition political parties. Sources indicate that the operation soon began targeting members of the political opposition and journalists who criticised the Government's activities. During the course of the operation, approximately 11,000 people were arrested and more than 2,000 weapons and 30,000 rounds of ammunition were seized. Furthermore, 44 people have reportedly died in the army's custody or in hospitals after being freed. Relatives of the victims claim that the detainees were brutally tortured in order to extract confessions.  The Government has only confirmed the deaths of 12 suspects and said that all of them died of heart attacks in hospitals after being handed over to police. Our sources have indicated that as many as 1000 persons may have been injured as a result of actions undertaken during Operation Clean Heart.   The indemnity ordinance is being viewed as a breach of the constitution and the rule of law, with Bangladeshi Barrister Kamal Hossain stating that the ordinance "formalises the government's hitherto undeclared policy of torturing and murdering suspects and [exposing] ordinary people to savage repression by the most powerful wing of the Government - the Armed Forces." Furthermore, the ordinance violates the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which Bangladesh ratified on October 5, 1998, notably under: Article 2 of the Convention, which states that "No exceptional circumstances whatsoever, whether...internal political instability or any other public emergency, may be invoked as a justification of torture"; Article 4(1) which states that "Each State Party shall ensure that all acts of torture are offences under its criminal law"; and, Article 13 which adds that, "Each State Party shall ensure that any individual who alleges he has been subjected to torture in any territory under its jurisdiction has the right to complain to and to have his case promptly and impartially examined...".  Law Minister Moudud Ahmed has stated, however, that the indemnity bill may be justified by Article 46 of the Bangladeshi Constitution, which allows the Government to grant indemnity in certain cases if approved by Parliament. The ordinance will be heard before Parliament on January 26th.   It is also worth noting that, while Operation Clean Heart has scaled down, with the troops being redeployed from the district to the divisional level, our sources indicate that further arrests remain likely, and that there are serious concerns for the physical and psychological integrity of all persons still being detained in relation with these events, many of whom are likely to be still at risk of being subjected to torture. An updated list of the persons who have thus far reportedly been killed as a result of Operation Clean Heart can be found at the end of this Urgent Appeal.  The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned by the massive human rights violations that have occurred during Operation Clean Heart, notably the arrest and detentions of some 11,000 persons and the allegedly widespread use of torture, which has led to some 44 deaths in detention. Furthermore, OMCT strongly opposes the so-called Joint Drive Indemnity Ordinance, which will enable as many as fifty thousand Bangladeshi troops to receive immunity from prosecution for these violations, if it is passed when it goes before the Bangladeshi Parliament on January 26th, 2003.
