The Court took the case under advisement and the decision is expected to be announced within the next 30 days.Mr. Rukuki was arrested by the Service National du Renseignement (SNR, the National Intelligence Service) on 13 July 2017 and unjustly sentenced to 32 years in prison on 26 April 2018, after a process characterised by serious violations of the right to fair trial. Sentenced for “rebellion”, “attacking the authority of the State”, “participation in an insurrectionist movement” and “receiving contributions and funds from foreign organisations”, he appealed the conviction on 29 May and subsequently applied for bail on 26 June, in order to receive adequate medical treatment and full rehabilitation in hospital after fracturing his ankle in jail.We, the undersigned organisations, demand:·      That the Burundian authorities:o  Release Germain Rukuki on humanitarian grounds; ando  Acquit Germain Rukuki of all charges. ·      That the international community:o  Continues monitoring the proceedings in order to ensure fair trial guarantees, and;o  Expresses support and solidarity with Mr Rukuki and his family. Germain Rukuki’s arrest and imprisonment is an unjust attack against his peaceful human rights work, as part of a deliberate and continuous attempt of Burundian authorities to silence and criminalise human rights defenders in the country.  The signatory organisationsProtection InternationalDefendDefenders (the East and Horn of Africa Human Rights Defenders Project)Féderation Internationale des ACAT (FIACAT)Front Line DefendersInternational Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), in the framework of the Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights DefendersInternational Service for Human Rights (ISHR)World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), in the framework of the Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders For media inquiries, please contactao@protectioninternational.org- +32 2 609 44 05.
