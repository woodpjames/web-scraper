The International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) publish the annual report 2005 of their joint programme, the Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders. This publication will be an opportunity to alert the international public opinion on the situation of these men and women who, in spite of the tremendous risks they face, persist in denouncing the human rights violations they have witnessed. The report presents the situation of 1,172 human rights defenders oppressed, as well as obstacles to freedom of association in nearly 90 countries. This report is not only an indicator of the state of freedoms of association and expression in the human rights area, but it also highlights the main tendencies of arbitrariness worldwide, and the fight of those who try to stand up to it.
