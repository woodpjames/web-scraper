New Information The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Association for the Reconstruction and Development of the Moko-Oh Peoples Cameroon (AFTRADEMOP), a member of the SOS-Torture network, and by a reliable source, of the release on bail on 14 March 2007 of Mr. Nfor Ngala Nfor, National Vice Chairman of the Southern Cameroons National Council (SCNC), and nine other SCNC members. The details of the nine other SCNC members released are the following:  Mr. Mbinglo H. Humphrey (65), Mr. Achu Nji David (56), Mr. Stephen Kongnso (45), Mr. Dzeni Augustine Shieyntum (36), Mr. Henry Lamnyam (35), Mr. Lucas Ngwa Che (57), Mr. Nguemu Clement Atanga (60), Mr. Mongo Steven (43), Mrs. Mbi Ann Rita (60).  According to the information received, while bail was granted on 13 March 2007, the detainees were only released from Bamenda Central Prison at 2:00pm on 14 March 2007 as the judge who presided the hearing allegedly left the Court without signing the official order to issue bail. The hearing on the preliminary investigation regarding the holding charge of “secessionist activities” has been adjourned on 17 April 2007. Nevertheless, according to the same information, Mr. Tanto Simon, National Auditor and National Information Bureau Member, arrested along with the others, is still in detention as he was not granted bail. After two hearings on 15 March 2007 and 29 March 2007, Mr. Tanto Simon next hearing was adjourned on 12 April 2007 before the Bamenda High Court. He remains in detention at the Bamenda Central Prison, allegedly in bad conditions and without access to medical care. OMCT welcomes the release on bail of the above mentioned persons. However, OMCT is concerned that Mr. Tanto Simon remains in detention and fears for his physical and psychological integrity.  OMCT calls on the authorities to guarantee his safety and to provide him with appropriate medical assistance as Mr. Tanto Simon is reportedly in poor health condition. OMCT further calls on the immediate release of Mr. Tanto Simon as well as the end of the judicial proceedings against the 11 SCNC members, in the absence of valid charges that are consistent with international law and standards, or, if such charges exist, bring them before an impartial and competent tribunal and guarantee their procedural rights at all times. Reminder of the situation OMCT had been informed about the arbitrary arrest and detention of Mr. Nfor Ngala Nfor, National Vice Chairman of the Southern Cameroons National Council (SCNC) and of 11 others members of the SCNC on 20 January 2007 in Bamenda. The details of the 11 members of the SCNC are as follows:  Mr. Mbinglo H. Humphrey, Northern Zone Chairman, residence in Bamenda Mr. Tanto Simon, National Auditor and National Information Bureau Member, residence in Bamenda Mr. Stephen Kongnso, County Chair, Bui, residence in Kumbo Mr. Henry Lamnyam, County Secretary, Donga Mantung, residence in Ndu Mr. Achu Njei David, Organising Secretary, Mezam County, residence in Santa Mr. Nguemo Clement, Financial Secretary, Santa LGA, residence in Santa Mr. Lucas Che Ngwa, Activist, residence in Bafut Mr. Dzeni Augustine Shiyntum, Activist, residence in Kumbo Mr. Mongo Steven, Activist, residence in Bamenda Mrs. Mbi Ann-Rita Eyong, Vice Chair, Kumba LGA, residence in Kumba Mr. Ngiewih Asunkwan, National Communication Officer (he was released on 6 March 2007), residence in Bameda  According to the information received, Mr. Nfor Ngala Nfor and the above 11 representatives were arrested, along with other members of SCNC (non-identified), during a press conference held within the premises of the SCNC office in Bamenda on 20 January 2007 by security forces without any warrant of arrest. After the opening of the press conference, the premises were raided by security forces of the Gendarmerie and Divisional Officers from the Mezam region who reportedly used excessive force, resulting in a large number of injuries. Members of the SCNC had assembled civilian and journalists for a press conference to inform of Mr. Nfor’s recent efforts to bring international attention to their situation. The SCNC advocates increased autonomy for Cameroon's English-speaking minority.  After some of the arrested members were released for various reasons, 12 of them, including Mr. Nfor Ngala Nfor, were transferred on 22 January 2007 to the Bamenda Central Prison. While Mr. Ngiewih Asunkwan was released on 6 March 2007, the others remained in detention.
