Brief description of the situation: The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources of the arrest and subsequent detention of Ms. Jelveh Javaheri, another women’s rights activist involved in the “One Million Signatures” petition campaign as well as a journalist and an active contributor of the website of the campaign, which seeks to put pressure on the Iranian legislators in order to withdraw provisions that have adverse effects on women’s human rights. According to the information received, on December 1, 2007, Ms. Jelveh Javaheri was summoned for questioning to the security branch of the Revolutionary Court in Tehran. She spent several hours in interrogation, and subsequently charged with “disruption of public opinion”, “propaganda against the state”, and “publication of lies” on the website of the One Million Signatures Campaign. She has since been transferred to Evin Prison’s Public Ward 3, where she remains detained. The Observatory expresses its deep concern about the increasing repression of the Iranian authorities against human rights defenders, in particular women’s rights activists involved in the One Million Signatures Campaign, and recalls that more than 100 women’s rights activists have been arrested, interrogated, or sentenced in the past two years and the government has raised over one million Euros by imprisoning the activists and releasing them on high bail. The Observatory further wishes to insist on the fact that Iran had committed to “uphold the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights”[1] by presenting its candidacy to the Human Rights Council 2006 election and had insisted in this regard on the fact that the country had “continuously put great efforts into safeguarding the status and inherent dignity of the human person as well as the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms”[2]. In order to ensure the continuation of these efforts, the Observatory urges the Islamic Republic of Iran to conform with international human rights standards. Actions requested: Please write to the authorities in Iran urging them to:  Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Ms. Jelveh Javaheri as well as all activists engaged in the “One Million Signatures” campaign; Release Ms. Jelveh Javaheri immediately and unconditionally since her detention is arbitrary as it merely aims at sanctioning her activities in favour of women’s human rights; Drop all arbitrary charges against all women’s rights defenders involved in the “One million signatures” campaign; Put an end to all acts of harassment, including at the judicial level, against Iranian human rights defenders; Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, Article 6.b, which provides that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others [...] freely to publish, impart or disseminate to others views, information and knowledge on all human rights and fundamental freedoms”, and Article 12.2, which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”; More generally, ensure in all circumstances the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with international and regional human rights instruments ratified by Iran.
