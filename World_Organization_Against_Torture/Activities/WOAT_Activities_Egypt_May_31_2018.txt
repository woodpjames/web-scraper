Judicial harassment
Egypt

The Observatory for the Protection of
Human Rights Defenders, a partnership of FIDH and the World Organisation
Against Torture (OMCT), has received new information and requests your urgent
intervention in the following situation in Egypt.
 
New information:
 
The Observatory has
been informed by reliable sources about the ongoing arbitrary detention and
judicial harassment of Mr. Wael Abbas, journalist. He is the author of the Misrdigital blog since 2006, in which he documents cases of
corruption, harassment of women, police brutality and discusses Egyptian
society. 
 
According
to the information received, on May 24, 2018, Mr. Wael Abbas appeared before
the state security prosecution, after being held incommunicado for 24 hours,
and was formally charged with “belonging to a terrorist group”, “publishing and
spreading false news” and “using a website to spread the ideologies of this
terrorist group” under case number 441 of 2018 state security. The prosecutor
ordered the detention of Mr. Wael Abbas for 15 days in pre-trial detention
pending investigation. Only one of his lawyer was allowed during the
investigation session. Mr. Wael Abbas is detained at Tora prison.
 
This
is not the first time that Mr. Wael Abbas is targeted by the authorities for
his human rights activities, as in the past years his Facebook account had been temporarily taken down by Egyptian
authorities, and his Twitter account
has been suspended since December 2017. In January 2018, Mr.
Wael Abbas reported that this suspension was linked to pending
accusations of being connected to ISIS.  
 
The
Observatory strongly condemns the arbitrary detention and judicial harassment
of Mr. Wael Abbas, and urges the Egyptian authorities to ensure he has
unhindered access to his family and lawyers as well as to ensure his
psychological and physical integrity. 
 
The
Observatory further urges the Egyptian authorities to immediately and
unconditionally release Mr. Wael Abbas as his detention is arbitrary and
clearly aims at punishing his peaceful and legitimate human rights activities.
 
The
Observatory is particularly concerned as Mr. Wael Abbas is the third human
rights defenders to be arrested since May 11, 2018, together with Ms. Amal Fathy[1]
and Mr. Haytham Mohamadein[2]
who both remain arbitrarily detained.
 
Background information:
 
On
May 23, 2018 at 4:30 am, Mr. Wael Abbas’ apartment was raided by heavily armed
police personnel who did not present any warrant. Mr. Wael Abbas posted a
message on his Facebook account
saying he was being arrested. He was taken blindfolded to an unknown location
after they seized computers, telephones, some books and several other items
that belong to him. 
 
Actions requested:
 
Please write to the
authorities of Egypt asking them to:
 
i.       
Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and
psychological integrity of Mr. Wael Abbas and all human rights defenders in Egypt;
 
ii.    Immediately
and unconditionally release Mr. Wael Abbas as his detention is arbitrary and merely
aimed at punishing him for his human rights activities;
 
iii.    Put
an end to all acts of harassment, including at the judicial level, Mr. Wael Abbas and all human
rights defenders in Egypt, and ensure that they are able to carry out
their activities without hindrance or fear of reprisals; 

iv.    Conform
with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by
the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially
Articles 1, 6(c) and 12.2; and
 
v.    More
generally, ensure in all circumstances the respect for human rights and
fundamental freedoms in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights and with international and regional human rights instruments ratified by
Egypt.
