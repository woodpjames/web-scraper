The Observatory for the
Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the International
Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation Against Torture
(OMCT), has received new information and requests your urgent intervention in
the following situation in Turkey.
 
New information:
 
The Observatory has been
informed by reliable sources of the ongoing judicial harassment faced by 47
lawyers, one journalist, one legal secretary and two drivers[1],
and the continued provisional detention of 15 lawyers, Messrs. Mehdi ÖZTÜZÜN,
Faik Özgür EROL, Muharem ŞAHİN, Fuat COŞACAK, İbrahim
BİLMEZ, Emran EMEKÇİ, Cengiz ÇİÇEK, Doğan ERBAŞ, Hatice
KORKUT, Ömer GÜNEŞ, Mehmet Sani KIZILKAYA, Mehmet
BAYRAKTAR, Bedri KURAN and Sabahattin KAYA, and Ms. Asya
ÜLKER, and journalist Cengiz
KAPMAZ under terrorism charges. 
 
Almost all lawyers had been involved in the legal representation of the
leader of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), Abdullah Öcalan, and are accused of “passing orders”. Some were also
engaged, as defence lawyers, in the Kurdish Communities Union (KCK)[2]
main trial held before Diyarbakır Heavy Penal Court No. 6 and had taken a
stance against the ban to use the Kurdish language before the Diyarbakır
courts. All accused are prosecuted under charges of being “members” or
“executives” “in an illegal organisation”, in this case the KCK.
 
According to the
information received, on June 20, 2013, the Istanbul Heavy Penal Court No. 6 held in the Campus of the Silivri
Prison the fifth hearing in the long running mass trial of lawyers. The court
heard several of the accused and decided to provisionally release seven of the
accused lawyers, mostly some it had heard at the previous hearing. Defence
lawyers raised several irregularities in the act of indictment. The prosecution
of another lawyer, Mr. Bekir KAYA, was joined to this case. The Court
postponed the hearing to September 17, 2013.
 
The Observatory mandated an international trial observer for this
hearing, as well as for the four previous hearings. 
 
The Observatory is deeply concerned by this ongoing judicial harassment
and the continued arbitrary detention of 15 lawyers and one journalist, which seems to merely aim at sanctioning the legitimate exercise of
their profession, and calls upon the Turkish judicial authorities
to release them immediately and unconditionally and drop the charges against
them. It also regrets the splitting of the hearing into several one-day
hearings, which undermines the right to a defence.
 
The Observatory further recalls that dozens of human rights
defenders are currently subjected to prolonged judicial harassment for abusive
terrorism charges in Turkey. In this context, members of Human Rights
Association (İnsan Haklari Derneği -
İHD) have particularly been the subject of a systematic campaign of judicial
harassment, as a direct result of their human rights work in Turkey, in
particular on Kurdish issues. 
 
This trial is one of dozens
of ongoing mass show trials of Kurdish intellectuals and activists in Turkey.
Since 2009, over 8,000 people have been arrested in the name of the KCK investigations
- counter-terrorism operations that in reality have little to do with
countering terrorism, but rather have been used as a means of criminalising
peaceful dissent and Kurdish political and cultural expression. 
 
Background information[3]:
 
On November 22, 2011, an
unprecedented broad campaign of arrest was launched and targeted dozens of
lawyers from the Ağrı, Ardahan, Batman,
Bursa, Diyarbakır, Denizli, Hakkari, Istanbul, Izmir, Kars, Mersin, Mus, Siirt, Sırnak, Urfa, Van Bar Associations, one journalist and three staff working for Asrin Law Firm (one legal secretary and
two law office drivers) in the scope of an anti-terrorism operation. Several of
the lawyers belonged to Asrin Law Firm. They
were taken into custody in Istanbul for their alleged membership in KCK under
charges of “membership in an illegal organisation” and “directing an illegal
organisation”. 
 
All were remanded into custody pending the end
of the investigation after they had been interrogated at the Beşiktaş
(Istanbul) Heavy Penal Court No. 11 and detained in İstanbul Bakırköy Closed
Prison for Females or Kocaeli Kandıra F Type Closed Prison No. 2. Some were
arrested a few weeks or months after. At the beginning of the detention,
communication between some of the lawyers and their families was restricted.
 
On April 18, 2012, the court accepted the
indictment order submitted to it on April 6. 46 lawyers together with one journalist and three staff working for
Asrin Law Firm were charged of “belonging to a criminal organisation”
under Article 314 of the TPC[4].
The opening of this case, known as the “Lawyers' Trial”, was scheduled for July
16, 2012.
 
The indictment is mostly
based on recordings of discussions held between Abdullah Öcalan and his lawyers
in the visiting room of İmralı Island Prison, in violation of the principle of confidentiality between lawyer and client, which is
fundamental to an effective legal defence or on evidence related to acts
ordinarily conducted by lawyers to defend their clients. 

On July 16-17, 2012, the trial opened before the Istanbul Heavy Penal Court No. 6 in Çağlayan
Justice Palace. At the time, only 36 lawyers and the journalist remained in
pre-trial detention. All others had been provisionally released. At the end of
this hearing nine lawyers were provisionally released. Dozens of international
trial observers monitored the hearing, including one lawyer mandated by the
Observatory. Trial observers complained about the very bad material conditions
of the hearing, which impaired the right to a fair trial.

Subsequently, one-day
hearings took place on November 6, 2012, January 3, 2013 and March 27, 2013
inside the Campus of the Silivri Prison, which has larger courtrooms. But,
still, at some hearings, the family of the accused were denied access to the
courtroom due to the lack of space. One lawyer was provisionally released on
January 3 and four on March 27.
 
These hearings
revealed a series of abuses in the prosecution of these lawyers, including
illegal wire-tapping of confidential lawyer-client meetings, illegal searches
conducted in law firms and other forms of covert surveillance, the failure of
the court to give reasons for its decisions, the unconstitutionality of some of
the provisions on which prosecution is based, the vagueness of elements of
crime substantiating the prosecution, etc.
