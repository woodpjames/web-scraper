ICJ-Kenya, IMLU, KAACR, COVAW-Kenya and OMCT submit an alternative report to
the UN Human Rights Committee to inform its review of Kenya’s
Third Periodic Report at its 105th Session (9 - 27 July 2012) on the implementation of the
Provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in
relation to torture.
The
report responds to the Third Periodic Report (CCPR/C/KEN/3) from the Government
of Kenya to the Human Rights Committee under Article 40 of the International
Convention on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the List of Issues
(CCPR/C/KEN/Q/3) that arose from the Government Report. The Concluding
Observations and the Comments adopted by the UN Treaty Bodies and special
procedures in the past with regard to Kenya inform
the contextual background.
The
report seeks to highlight the prevalent incidences of torture and related human
rights violations in Kenya as
serious concerns remain in this area. The overall conclusion is that whilst Kenya has
endeavoured to include the principles of the ICCPR in its newly promulgated
Constitution of 2010 and legislative framework, there continue to be important
legislative and administrative gaps that still provide challenges towards full
implementation of the ICCPR as specified in subsequent chapters. 
This
alternative report adopts a thematic approach and specifically focuses on
articles that relate to the protection from torture, cruel and degrading
treatment under the Convention including extra-judicial killings, death
penalty, the principle of non-refoulement, treatment of prisoners, access to
effective remedies and right to a fair trial. It integrates a gender and
child-rights perspective and examines the problems related to domestic
violence, FGM and reproductive health rights. The report ends with an extended list
of recommendations to the State party and a list of questions. 

The HRC public session on Kenya
will be webcasted.
