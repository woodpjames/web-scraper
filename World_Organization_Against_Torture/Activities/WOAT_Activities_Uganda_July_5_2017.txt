		The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a 
partnership of FIDH and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), 
requests your urgent intervention in the following situation 
in Uganda.

		 

Description of the situation:

		 

		The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the 
murder of Mr. Erasmus Irumba, Coordinator of the Twerwaneho 
Listeners Club (TLC)[1] in 
Ntoroko District, Western Uganda. Recently, his work focused on monitoring 
the delivery of public services in Butungama, Bweramule and Rwebisengo 
sub-counties. He notably investigated the misuse of public funds in health 
services.

		 

		According to the information received,on June 23, 2017, at around 7:30 pm, 
Mr. Irumba was set to meet with Uganda People’s Defence Forces 
(UPDF)[2]  senior officials in 
the province of Ntoroko, at Butungama trading center. Although Mr. Irumba 
was summoned to “discuss matters of public importance” he was 
told not to be suspicious as he had no criminal record and since no criminal 
charges were pending against him. During the meeting, Mr. Erasmus Irumba and 
another member of the community, Mr. Siet Kanyoro who was accompanying him, 
were both shot in the leg. Whilst still alive, they were both put in the 
boot of a private car, driven to a rural area and shot dead at a close 
range. Both lifeless bodies were taken to Buhinga Regional Referral Hospital 
in Fort Portal, on the wee hours of June 24, 2017.

		 

		It has been reported that UPDF Lieutenant Colonel Richard Muhangi, the 
Commanding Officer of the 3rd Mountain Battalion under 2
nd Division who was present during the shooting, as well as, Ntoroko 
District Police Commander and District Internal Security Officer, who were 
also there at the time of the incident, have all been arrested in connection 
with the shooting and subsequently charged with “murder” and 
“attempted murder”.

		 

		The Observatory recalls that for his human rights work, Mr. Irumba had 
alreadybeen the target of verbal threats by local officials and politicians. 
Likewise, other TLC members have been subjected to judicial harassment[3] .

		 

		The Observatory condemns in the strongest terms the murder of Mr. Irumba 
and urges authorities in Uganda to adopt effective measures to ensure the 
protection of human rights defenders in the country.

		 

		The Observatory also calls for an immediate, thorough, impartial and 
transparent investigation without undue delay into Mr. Irumba’s murder 
and for those responsible to be held accountable.
