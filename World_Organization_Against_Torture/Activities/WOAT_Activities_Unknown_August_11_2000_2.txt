New Information  The Observatory is gravely concerned for the physical and psychological integrity of journalist Miroslav Filipovic, based on reports of his ill health from Reporters sans Frontières (RSF).  According to information obtained by RSF, on 8 August 2000, Filipovic was transferred from the Nis military prison to the military hospital in Belgrade, where he was treated for "heart troubles". The same day, Slavica, the journalist's wife, was able to visit him. His daughter, Ivana, explained to RSF that her father was "physically affected" by his detention.   Since 31 July, the journalist was examined every day in the Nis hospital for feelings of sickness linked to heart problems. While the doctor who had monitored him recommended that he stay in the hospital during the night, the hospital's management required the journalist, until Monday 7 August, to return each night to the Nis military prison. According to his close relations, Filipovic has allegedly lost twenty kilograms since the beginning of his detention in May.  Brief reminder of the situation  Mr. Miroslav Filipovic, a correspondant in Kraljevo (in the center of Serbia), for the daily independent Danas as well as the Agence France-Presse (AFP), and a regular collaborator with the Helsinki Commitee for Human Rights, was sentenced to 7 years in prison by the military Tribunal of Nis on 26 July 2000 for « espionage » and « disseminating false information. »    He was arrested for the first time on 8 May in his apartment in Kraljevo by members of the security services. Released on 12 May, he was re-incarcerated ten days later. Miroslav Filipovic was accused on 13 June 2000 on the basis of articles reporting about the testimony of officers on crimes committed by the Yugoslav army in Kosovo during the NATO bombings on the Internet site of the Institute for War and Peace Reporting.  Mr. Filipovic’s lawyers appealed the decision of the Tribunal.    The Observatory recalled that this sentence, the most severe ever given by the authorities of Yugoslavia according to Reporters Sans Frontières, was passed down in an atmosphere where the repression of Serbian independent media has worsened since the beginning of the year, as it has for all persons and organisations that speak out or defend positions which criticise and/or differ from the government. Actions requested :  Please write to the authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia urging them to :  i.	ensure that Miroslav Filipovic receives immediately the necessary medical care that he requires; ii.	order the immediate release of Miroslav Filipovic, who was arrested and arbitrarily detained; iii.	abide by the provisions of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9th 1999 ("Declaration on the Rights and Responsibility of individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms ") and more particularly article 1 which provides that "Everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels", as well as article 6.b, cited previously;  iv.	more generally abide by the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the regional and international covenants ratified by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
