Health
concern/ Fear for the safety
 
The
International Secretariat of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT)
requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in Myanmar/ Burma.
 
Brief description of the
situation
 
The International Secretariat
of OMCT has been informed by a reliable source and Antenna International, a member
organisation of OMCT SOS-Torture Network, about the poor health condition of
Mr. Min Ko Naing[1],
a democracy activist and leader of the 88 Generation Students Group[2],
as a result of harsh conditions of detention in Kengtung prison, where he is
serving a 65-year prison sentence.  
 
According to the
information received, Mr. Min Ko Naing is suffering from osteoporosis, a
disease weakening the bones that is exacerbated by poor diet, lack of exercise
(he is allegedly only allowed one hour a day for walking) and lack of proper
medical care. Furthermore, Kengtung prison, which is located in Shan State reportedly
one of the coldest places in the country, is cold and damp. OMCT recalls that
Mr. Min Ko Naing has previously suffered from a serious eye infection and
hypertension while in prison[3].

 
OMCT has also been
informed that Mr. Min Ko Naing is only allowed to meet with family members one
time every three months. 
 
Mr. Min Ko Naing was arrested
on 21 August 2007 along with other
members of the 88 Generation Students Group by members of the Police Special Branch subsequent to peaceful protests against fuel
hikes[4].
On 11 November 2008, he was sentenced to 65 years in prison by a special court
held inside Ma-Ubin prison following an unfair trial and later transferred to
Kengtung prison, 700 miles North of Rangoon. 
 
OMCT is also gravely concerned about the
health condition of Ms. Tate Naing, aka Nilar Thein, another
member of the 88 Generation Student group sentenced to 65 years imprisonment and who
is reportedly suffering from peptic ulcer. Ms. Tate Naing is being detained in Thayet
prison in Magwe Division. 
 
The International Secretariat of OMCT expresses
its deepest concern about Mr. Min Ko Naing’s and Ms. Tate Naing’s, aka Nilar Thein, health
conditions, and urges the competent authorities to grant them immediate access
to independent medical doctors and to guarantee that they receive
adequate medical care as
provided for by international human rights standards, including the UN Standard
Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners. 

Action requested
 
Please write to the
authorities in Myanmar/ Burma urging them to:
 
i.                    
Guarantee, in all circumstances, the physical and
psychological integrity of Mr. Min Ko Naing and Ms. Tate Naing, aka Nilar Thein; 
ii.                  
Guarantee unconditional and regular access to their
respective lawyers and families, as well as guarantee that they are promptly
examined by independent medical doctors and receive adequate medical care in
accordance with, inter alia, the UN
Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners; 
iii.                 
Release Mr. Min Ko Naing and Ms. Tate Naing, aka
Nilar Thein, immediately and unconditionally; 
iv.                
Ensure the respect of human rights and fundamental
freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and
international human rights standards.

[1] See OMCT urgent appeal MMR 191108 and Press Release “No
proper medical care for jailed leading democracy activist” issued on 22 April 2008. 


[2] All
members of the 88 Generation Students Group are former student leaders who
organised in 1988 a major popular uprising in Burma, which the military regime
responded to by killing up to 10,000 students and activists throughout the
country. They spent over 15 years in prison after suffering severe torture and
were released in 2004.


[3] See abovementioned OMCT urgent
appeal and press release.



[4] The arrests
followed a peaceful march that took place on 19 August 2007 in order to protest against the decision, on 15 August 2007, by the regime to double the
price of diesel and petrol and quintupled the prices of compressed natural gas
for cooking and buses. See joint OMCT- FIDH press release issued on 22 August 2007.
