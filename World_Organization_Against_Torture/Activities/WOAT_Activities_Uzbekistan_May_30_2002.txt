He was transferred to Tashkent and put in detention in the basement of the MVD.  The Observatory is very concerned for the physical integrity and health of M. Y. Rasulov. It recalls that Mr Shavrik Ruzimuradov, Chairman of the Kashkadarya regional department of HRSU, arrested on 12 June 2001 and detained in the same detention center, was found dead after being allegedly tortured on 7 July 2001 (see Urgent Appeals UZB 003/0106/OBS 055 and UZB 003/0106/OBS 055.1).  Moreover, on 27 May 2002, Mr. Talib Yakubov, Chairman of HRSU, joined by M Nakhtiyor Khamraev, Chairman of the Jizzak regional department of HRSU and Mr. Yodgor Turlibekov, member of HRSU Kashkadarya department, decided to hold a peaceful picket near the building of MVD, against the unlawfulness of Mr Rasulov’s arrest and detention.  After M. Yakubov was asked by Colonel Tashmatov to enter into the building to talk with him, the demonstrators were attacked. N. Khamraev, Y. Turlibekov and Tulkina Karaeva, journalist of the “Voice of America” Radio Station were arrested by police officers and transferred to the Yakkasaray Regional Department of Interior (ROVD).  During the transfer, one of the policemen hit M. Khamraev in the abdomen. When M. Yakubov  learned what happened, he went to the Yakkasaray ROVD and obtained the release of the three detainees.   The Observatory expresses its deepest concerns about those acts of reprisals against human rights defenders in Uzbekistan. It recalls that they are flagrant violations of the right to peaceful assembly and freedom of expression as well as the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the UN General Assembly on 9 December 1998, in particular with its article 1 which stipulates that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels” and with its article  according to which: “for the purpose of promoting and protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms, everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, at the national and international levels: a)to meet or assemble peacefully.”.   Action requested:   Please write to the authorities in Uzbekistan urging them to:  i  guarantee Mr. Yuldash Rasulov’s physical and psychological integrity in all circumstances and, in the absence of any charges against him, proceed to its immediate release;  ii   proceed to an independent and impartial investigation on the treatment of M. Khamraev, find those responsible and bring them to justice;  iii    put an immediate end to the persecution and the harassment of the independent human rights activists and allow them to act freely;  iv  ensure the implementation of the provisions of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations, on 9 December 1998, in particular its article 1 and 5.a mentioned above;  v  guarantee the respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with the Universal Declaration on Human Rights.
