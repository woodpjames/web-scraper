 Platform, of which OMCT is member organisation, is a coalition of 50 human rights NGOs from Europe, Eurasia 
and the US aimed at serving as a conduit through which civic activists 
can build alliances, strengthen mutual support and solidarity​Representatives of 42 international and national 
non-governmental organizations issue the appeal to the Parliamentary 
Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) to request the appointment of a
 Rapporteur to examine the situation of political prisoners in 
Azerbaijan.
The full statement is available here: Azerbaijan_2018.06.13_CSP Letter to PACE
Civil society groups report that today there are at least 100 
prisoners held on politically motivated charges in Azerbaijan. Among 
them are dozens of religious activists, at least nine journalists, 
editors and bloggers as well as members of the political opposition, 
human rights defenders and several persons who have been imprisoned in 
retaliation for the actions of their relatives who have fled the 
country. The most notable cases include the continued imprisonment of 
former opposition Presidential candidate Ilgar Mammadov, investigative 
journalist Afghan Mukhtarli, the leader of Muslim Unity Movement Tale 
Baghirzade, and Mehman Huseynov, young blogger and journalist who 
documented corruption among high-ranking government officials through 
his YouTube posts.
It is time for PACE to take decisive action to tackle the issue of 
political prisoners in Azerbaijan in order to hold the authorities 
accountable for implementing the commitments undertaken upon the country’s accession to the Council of Europe in 2001.
Resuming the work started by Christopher Strässer will send a first 
strong signal to the Azerbaijani authorities to demonstrate that the 
Assembly will not tolerate a continuation of this systematic repressive 
practice which has no place in a Council of Europe Member State. As 
politically motivated imprisonment violates the underlying principles of
 the Council of Europe, appointing a Rapporteur with the mandate to 
investigate the issue and make recommendations is consistent with the 
mandate of the organisation.
Reiterating our concerns about the widespread use of politically 
motivated imprisonment in Azerbaijan we, the undersigned civil society 
organizations call upon the members of the Committee on Legal Affairs 
and Human Rights the PACE, which has been mandated to make a decision on
 this matter, to:
Appoint a Rapporteur to examine the issue of political prisoners in Azerbaijan;Ensure that the Rapporteur is appointed through a fully transparent process and in close consultation with civil society.Signatures:
