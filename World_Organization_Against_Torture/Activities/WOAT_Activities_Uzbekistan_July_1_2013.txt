She was kept in a closed and confined room, with limited access to amenities. She was deported from Uzbekistan the following day, on June 25, around noon. The border police officer explained to Ms. Ismailova that she was on a black list following her visit to Uzbekistan in 2009. This is when she accompanied Ms. Mutabar Tajibaeva, a well-known Uzbek human rights defender and former prisoner of conscience and currently President of the NGO Human Rights "Fiery Hearts Club". They visited Fergana Valley and Tashkent and were continuously followed by the Uzbek intelligence services, but were allowed to leave the country.The Observatory recalls that Kyrgyz citizens do not need a visa to enter Uzbekistan. The Observatory therefore fears that such obstacles to Ms. Tolekan Ismailova’s freedom of movement merely aim at sanctioning her human rights activities.The Observatory calls on the authorities of Uzbekistan to conform to Article 13 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) to which Uzbekistan is a party since September 28, 1995 and establishes that “An alien lawfully in the territory of a State Party to the Covenant may be expelled therefrom only in pursuance of a decision reached in accordance with law [...]”, as well as to the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 9, 1998.Actions requested: Please write to the Uzbek authorities and ask them to:i.       Put an end to the obstacles to the freedom of movement of Ms. Tolekan Ismailova, in particular remove her from the “black list”, as they seem to merely aim at sanctioning her human rights activities;ii.      Put an end to all forms of harassment against human rights defenders in the country or entering the country, and ensure that they are able to carry out their work freely without any hindrances in all circumstances;iii.     Comply with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, in particular Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually or collectively, to promote the protection and fulfilment of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, as well as Article 12.2, which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually or in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”;iv.      Comply with the provisions of the Document of the Copenhagen Meeting of the 2nd Conference on the Human Dimension of the Cooperation and Security Conference in Europe (CSCE) (1990), and guarantee the respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international human rights instruments ratified by Uzbekistan.Addresses:·        Mr. Islam Abduganiyevich Karimov President of Uzbekistan, ul.
