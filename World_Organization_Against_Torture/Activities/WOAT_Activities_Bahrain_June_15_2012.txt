Re: judicial harassment against Mr. Nabeel Rajab; visa request for trial observation
 
Excellency,
 
The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), is writing to you to express its deepest concerns over the ongoing judicial harassment against, and arbitrary detention of, Mr. Nabeel Rajab, President of the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights (BCHR), Director of the Gulf Centre for Human Rights (GCHR) and FIDH Deputy Secretary General[1]. The Observatory announces its intention to observe the upcoming hearing against Mr. Rajab, scheduled for June 24, 2012 in Manama.
 
Mr. Nabeel Rajab was most recently summoned on June 6, 2012 by the Public Prosecutor after he tweeted his belief that the Prime Minister had been warmly welcomed by villagers on the occasion of his recent travel to Al Mashraq in exchange for subsidies. On the same day, Mr. Rajab was interrogated and ordered a seven-day imprisonment pending further investigation. On June 13, his detention was extended to June 19. His lawyer requested his release on bail but the prosecution refused without giving any proper argument.
