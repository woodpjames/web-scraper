Ms. Fathy is also the wife of Mr. Mohamed Lotfy, Executive Director of the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF), and a former member of the now banned April 6th movement. According to the information received, on May 13, 2018, Ms. Amal Fathy was questioned by the High State Security Prosecution about the 6th April Movement, the ECRF and the activities of her husband. She was then placed under preventive detention for 15 additional days in the framework of Case No. 621 of 2018, under which she is facing new charges of “membership of an illegal organisation”, “using the Internet to disseminate ideas that seek to call for terrorist acts” and “broadcasting false news to disrupt public security and harm national interest”. The Observatory strongly condemns the arbitrary detention of Ms. Amal Fathy, which seems to merely aim at punishing her for her peaceful and legitimate human rights activities and/or those of her husband, Mr. Mohamed Lotfy. Indeed, this is not the first time that ECRF and its members are subjected to harassment, due to their documentation of cases of torture in prisons, enforced disappearances as well as their legal support in Giulio Regeni’s case[1]. The raid on Mr. Mohamed Lotfy’s house and the arrest of his wife Amal Fathy actually took place one week before a visit by the Italian technical team to review video footage in connection with the 2016 torture and killing of the Italian researcher.The Observatory urges the Egyptian authorities to release Ms. Amal Fathy immediately and unconditionally, to drop all charges against her and to put an end to all forms of harassment against her, including at the judicial level. Background information: On May 11, 2018, at around 2.30 am, Egyptian security forces broke into the house in Cairo of Ms. Amal Fathy and Mr. Mohamed Lotfy and started searching the house. Their mobile phones were seized and they were denied the right to communicate with a lawyer or their relatives. The two activists were brought to Maadi police station, in the south of Cairo, along with their three-year-old son. Around three hours later, Mr. Lotfy and his son were released. Maadi Prosecutor subsequently placed Ms. Amal Fathy under preventive detention for 15 days in Case No. 7991 of 2018. She was accused of “broadcasting a video harming national security”, “posting a video inciting to overthrow the regime and spreading false rumors”, and “misusing social media”. On May 12, 2018, Ms. Amal Fathy was transferred to Qanater women’s prison.  On May 9, 2018, Ms. Amal Fathy posted a 12-minute video on Facebook criticising the Egyptian Government for failing to protect women against sexual harassment as well as over a general deterioration in living conditions in the country. Over the next day, pro-government and State-owned media outlets released articles citing the video, identifying Ms. Fathy as an April 6 movement activist and the wife of Mohamed Lotfy and accusing her of insulting Egypt and Egyptian institutions. This was followed by a wave of harassment on social media along with threats against Ms. Fathy. Actions requested: Please write to the authorities of Egypt asking them to: i.        Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Ms. Amal Fathy, Mr. Mohamed Lotfy, their relatives and all human rights defenders in Egypt; ii.    Immediately and unconditionally release Ms. Amal Fathy as her detention is arbitrary and it is merely aimed at punishing her for her human rights activities as well as those of her husband; iii.    Put an end to all acts of harassment, including at the judicial level, against Ms. Amal Fathy as well as against Mr. Mohamed Lotfy and all human rights defenders in Egypt, and ensure that they are able to carry out their activities without hindrance; iv.    Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially Articles 1, 6(c) and 12.2; and v.    More generally, ensure in all circumstances the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with international and regional human rights instruments ratified by Egypt. Addresses: ·     President of the Arab Republic of Egypt, H.E.
