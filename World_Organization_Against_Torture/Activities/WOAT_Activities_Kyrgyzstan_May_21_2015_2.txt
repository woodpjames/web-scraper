The Observatory for the Protection of Human 
Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the International Federation for Human 
Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), requests your 
urgent intervention in the following situation in 
Kyrgyzstan.
 
Description of the 
situation:
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable 
sources about an assault against participants to an event organised by Labris, a 
local NGO advocating for the respect of the rights of the LGBTI community in 
Kyrgyzstan.
 
According to the information received, on May 
17, 2015, the organisers and the participants to the event held to commemorate 
the International Day Against Homophobia were verbally and physically attacked 
and one participant was injured. The group of men responsible for the assault is 
allegedly associated with Kalys and Kirk Choro, two groups well known for their 
anti-LGBTI positions.
 
Afterwards, both assaulters and participants 
were taken under police custody. Upon their arrival at the police station, the 
participants faced further harassment by the police officers, who denied them 
medical care and subjected them to humiliating personal searches. On the other 
hand, the assaulters were treated respectfully. Moreover, two lawyers called to 
the police station by activists were denied access. A third attempt to request 
lawyer's presence was only partially complied, as the lawyer was denied access 
to the interrogation room.
 
After more than five hours of questioning under 
police custody, finally a criminal case was opened against the assaulters, while 
the participants were released. The participants are planning to file a 
complaint against the police officers.
 
The Observatory recalls that Kyrgyz LGBTI 
rights defenders have been recently facing constant harassment. One month ago, 
the premises of the NGO Labris were set on fire.
 
The Observatory is further concerned about the 
consideration by the Kyrgyz Parliament of a highly controversial law banning the 
“propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations”. If passed, the law shall 
provide for administrative and criminal sanctions in the form of fines and 
imprisonment up to one year. The draft law, that was condemned by civil society, 
international human rights bodies and other international actors as being 
inherently discriminatory and infringing freedom of expression, freedom of 
assembly and other fundamental rights protected by Kyrgyzstan’s Constitution, 
was largely approved in the first reading in October 2014.
 
The Observatory is also extremely concerned by 
the fatwa launched on January 29, 2014, by Kyrgyzstan's acting grand mufti, 
Maksat Hajji Toktomushev, against same-sex relations. Back in 2014, the mufti 
alreadycalled on the Kyrgyz authorities to “pay particular attention to the 
activities of public organisations that seed social hatred using humanitarian 
ideas”.
 
The Observatory expresses its deepest concern 
about the above-mentioned events and more in general about the intensification 
of harassment against the LGBTI community and its supporters, and fears that 
participants and organisers of the event on May 17, 2015 were attacked as a 
result of their human rights activities.
 
The Observatory calls for an immediate, 
thorough, transparent investigation into the assault, in order to identify all 
those responsible, bring them before an independent tribunal, and apply to them 
the sanctions provided by the law.
 
Actions requested:
