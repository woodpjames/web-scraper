and its local partner Children’s Legal Rights and Development Center (CLRDC)
have promoted a mission from 10 to 15 june 2013, in order to conduct monitoring
visits to juvenile detention centres in the city of Manila.During the mission three centres were visited (Navotas Holding Centre
for Youth, Bahay Sabdigan Centre and Yakap Bata Centre) and interviews were
conducted with children detained. OMCT also met with authorities of the Council
for the Welfare of Children and authorities of the Swiss Embassy to discuss the
conditions and treatment of children in conflict with the law in the Philippines.
OMCT expresses its concern over the poor conditions of the detention
centres that were visited and notices with great concern that abandoned and
homeless children are placed in detention together with children who are in
conflict with the law.
Authorities claimed that they were placed there due to the lack of
appropriate places to receive them.  
A number of children claimed that violence in the detention centres
included beating, kicking, slapping, hitting with woods and metal bars and that
torture also happened in police stations, during their arrest.
OMCT recalls that the deprivation of liberty of a child must always be a
measure of last resort and for the minimum necessary period. Children deprived
of liberty are in a situation of special vulnerability and must be entitled to special
measures of protection in order to guarantee their safeguard and humane
treatment.
