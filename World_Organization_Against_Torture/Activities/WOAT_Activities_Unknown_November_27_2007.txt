According to the information received, on November 22, 2007, Mr. Sohrab Razzaghi was released after paying a 200,000 $ bail. As of issuing this urgent appeal, no charge would have been brought against him.  The Observatory welcomes the release of Mr. Razzaghi, but fears that his arbitrary detention might have been aimed at preventing him from taking part in the platform of the NGO “Frontline Protection of Human Rights Defenders”, to which he was invited to take part in Dublin from November 22 to 24, 2007.  The Observatory expresses its deep concern about the increasing repression of the Iranian authorities against human rights defenders, in particular pro-reform students, women’s rights activists and intellectuals. The Observatory also wishes to insist on the fact that Iran committed to “uphold the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights”[1] by presenting its candidacy to the Human Rights Council 2006 election and had insisted in this regard on the fact that the country had “continuously put great efforts into safeguarding the status and inherent dignity of the human person as well as the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms”[2]. In order to ensure the continuation of these efforts, the Observatory urges the Islamic Republic of Iran to conform in all circumstances with these pledges and with international human rights standards.  Background information:  On October 24, 2007, Mr. Sohrab Razzaghi was arbitrarily arrested at his home, and brought to section 209 of the Evin prison in Tehran. He had just finished drafting a report on civil society in Iran, titled Analysis of the status of the Iranian Civil Society: Opportunities, Challenges and Strategies.  Mr. Razzaghi has already been targeted by the authorities in the past. On March 15, 2007, the Volunteer Actors Institute, together with two other NGOs (namely the Rahi Legal Centre and the Non-Governmental Organizations Training Centre), was shut down, sealed, and barred from further activities, following orders issued by the Ministry of Intelligence and the Tehran Revolutionary Court. On the same day, Mr. Razzaghi was interrogated for several hours, and security officials confiscated some of his personal belongings and froze the ICTRC as well as his personal bank accounts.  Mr. Razzaghi was a professor at the Allameh University until he was dismissed from this position following the election of Mr. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad for President in 2005. He also served as deputy for NGO affairs within the Ministry of the Interior under Former President Mohammad Khatani.  Actions requested:   Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Sohrab Razzaghi; Refrain from undertaking any kind of judicial proceeding against him, that would aim at sanctioning his human rights activities; Put an end to all acts of harassment against all Iranian human rights defenders; Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration of Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, Article 6.b, which provides that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others [...] freely to publish, impart or disseminate to other views, information and knowledge on all human rights and fundamental freedoms”, and Article 12.2, which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”; More generally, ensure in all circumstances the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international and regional human rights instruments ratified by Iran.
