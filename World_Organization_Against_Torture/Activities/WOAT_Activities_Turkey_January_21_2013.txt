Judicial harassment
Turkey
January 21, 2013
 
The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of
the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation
Against Torture (OMCT), has received new information and requests your urgent
intervention in the following situation in Turkey.
 
New information:
 
The Observatory has
been informed by reliable sources about the continued judicial
harassment faced by Ms. Pinar Selek, a writer and
sociologist who has been actively advocating for peace and women's rights and
defending the rights of vulnerable communities in Turkey, including women, the
poor, street children, sexual minorities and the Kurd and Armenian minorities.
 
According to the
information received, on January 24, 2013, the Istanbul Heavy Penal Court
No. 12 will hear the case against Ms. Pinar Selek and may issue a
fourth verdict. She faces charges of causing a bomb to explode in Istanbul’s
Egyptian bazaar on July 9, 1998, and of being a member of a terrorist
organisation for that purpose. She faces up to life imprisonment.
 
The Observatory recalls
that Istanbul Heavy Penal Court No. 12 acquitted her on three occasions: in
2006, 2008, and for the last time on February 9, 2011. Following appeals filed
by the Prosecutor, the Court of Cassation quashed the first two acquittal
decisions (see background information). 
 
The Observatory
reiterates its call on the Turkish authorities to immediately and
unconditionally put an end to the judicial harassment that has been
targeting Ms. Pinar Selek for 15 years, as it seems to merely aim at
sanctioning her human rights
activities.
 
Background
information[1]:
 
In 1998, Ms. Pınar Selek, as a sociologist, carried
out a research project that involved interviewing members of the Kurdistan
Workers Party (PKK), seeking to understand the motivations of both sides in the
enduring armed conflict between the Kurdish minority and the Turkish State. 
 
On July 9, 1998, an explosion in the Istanbul Spice
Bazaar caused a number of deaths and injuries.
 
On July 11, 2008, Ms. Pınar Selek was arrested by the
security services and interrogated about the people she interviewed during her
research. When she refused to reveal the names of her informants, she was
severely tortured. 
 
In August 1998, Ms. Pınar Selek was accused of having
ordered the bomb attack on the basis of a testimony made by a detainee
reportedly under torture. The defendant later withdrew his statement during the
trial, saying he did not know Ms. Selek. Police and court’s investigations largely
confirmed the absence of any bomb and attributed the explosion to a gas leak. 
 
In December 2000, Ms. Selek was released on bail after
she had spent two years and a half in prison. Both in 2006 and 2008, İstanbul
Heavy Penal Court No. 12 acquitted her after determining there was no evidence
linking her to the blast. The prosecutor nevertheless appealed twice against
these rulings, and the Court of Cassation twice granted the motion by annulling
the first instance verdicts. The General Prosecutor of the Court of Cassation
appealed against the rulings of the Court of Cassation. On February 9, 2010,
the High General Criminal Council of the Court of Cassation rejected the
General Prosecutor’s appeal and in its judgement clearly stated that the ruling
of the Court of Cassation was reasonable and called for a life prison sentence
for Ms. Selek. 
 
On February 9, 2011, Ms. Selek again appeared on trial
before İstanbul Heavy Penal Court No. 12, which decided to acquit her for the
third time. On the next day, the prosecution appealed again to the Court of
Cassation. To date, the appeal on the third acquittal remains pending before
the Court of Cassation.
 
In June 2011 and afterwards, several hearings took
place before the Istanbul Heavy Penal Court No. 12 in relation to other aspects
of the criminal case.
 
On November 22, 2012, the Istanbul Heavy Penal
Court No. 12 decided to amend its previous decision to acquit
Ms. Pinar Selek. In addition, the Presiding Judge, who was replacing
the ordinary presiding judge on sick leave, requested
the condemnation of Ms. Selek to life imprisonment before setting a new
date for a hearing on December 13, 2012 to hear the observations of the
accused.
 
Ms. Pinar Selek's
lawyers filed a petition to revoke the Presiding Judge on account of
impartiality. This motion was rejected by Istanbul Heavy Penal Court Nos.
12 and 13. 
 
On December 13, 2012,
the Istanbul Heavy Penal Court No. 12 referred the case to January 24, 2013 to
allow the Istanbul Heavy Penal Court No. 14 to examine the petition filed by
Ms. Pinar Selek's lawyers.

- - its Article 6 (c) which states that
“everyone has the right, individually and in association with others to study,

- as well as Article 12.2, which provides that
“the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the
competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others,
against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse
discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his

Declaration” ;
 
iv. More generally, ensure in all circumstances the
