Musa Ibraheam Mohamed, 17 Yrs, Fur  According to the information received, on 16-17 December 2004, during aerial bombardments on Marla village by the air forces, the armed forces arrested twenty-four men and three children from Marla, Domma, Labado and Belail villages in Nyala province, southern Darfur state.  The men and the children were initially taken into military custody in Nyala where they were detained for 2 days. During the arrest and along the way from Douma and Marla to Nyala, the twenty-four men and three children were allegedly tortured by the armed forces. They were beaten with sticks all over their bodies, flogged on their backs and chests and kicked with military boots on both their faces and sides.  On 19 December 2004, the detainees were moved to Nyala Wasat (central) police station where they were officially charged under articles 51 (Waging War against the State), and 53 (Espionage against the country) of the 1991 Penal Code. On 20 December 2004, the 24 men and 3 children were transferred to Nyala prison where they remain in detention.  SOAT lawyers in Nyala visited the detainees in Nyala Prison and submitted an application to the Attorney General requesting medical examination of the detainees. The medical reports confirm that the men and the children were subjected to torture. The wounded detainees are receiving medical treatment from Amel Medical Centre for Rehabilitation of Torture Victims in Nyala, SOAT partner organisation in Nyala.  The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned about the physical and psychological integrity of the afore-mentioned individuals, including children and urges the Sudanese authorities to immediately release them in the absence of legal charges consistent with international law standards.   Regarding the three minors, Tariq Dawood Joumaa, Ahmed Yousif Bourma and Musa Ibraheam Mohamed, OMCT recalls that Sudan, as a state party to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, is bound by the provisions that a child shall only be deprived of liberty “(…) as a measure of last resort and for the shortest appropriate period of time” (Art. 37 (b)), as well as the “guarantee to be presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law (i) and to have the matter determined without delay by a competent, independent and impartial authority or judicial body in a fair hearing according to law (iii)” (Art. 40, §2.(b)). Moreover under article 37(a), (b) of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, “no child shall be subjected to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment [and that] no child shall be deprived of his or her liberty unlawfully or arbitrarily.” OMCT calls on the authorities to launch prompt, thorough and impartial investigations into the allegations of torture and ill treatment in order to find those responsible for any violations of human rights and to bring them to justice. Finally, OMCT calls on the authorities to guarantee that adequate compensation is awarded to all victims.    Action Requested Please write to the authorities in Sudan urging them to:   i. take all measures necessary to guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of all detainees, in particular Tariq Dawood Joumaa, Ahmed Yousif Bourma and Musa Ibraheam Mohamed;  ii. order the immediate release of all detainees in absence of legal charges consistent with international law standards, or, if such charges exist, bring them before an impartial and competent tribunal and guarantee their procedural rights at all times;  iii. order a thorough and impartial investigation into the circumstances of these events, notably the allegations of ill-treatment and torture, in order to identify those responsible and bring them to trial and apply the penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions as provided by law;  iv. guarantee that adequate compensation would be awarded to all victims;  v. guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
