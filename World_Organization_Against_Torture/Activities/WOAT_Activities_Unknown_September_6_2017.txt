The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a partnership of FIDH
and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory.

 
Description of the situation:
 
The Observatory has been
informed by reliable sources about the arbitrary detention and judicial
harassment of Mr. Salah Hamouri, a
Franco-Palestinian lawyer and field researcher with Addameer Prisoner Support
and Human Rights Association (Addameer)[1] in
the Occupied Palestinian Territory. He is also a former prisoner of opinion who
spent six years in Israeli jail.
                 
According
to the information received, on September 5, 2017, the Jerusalem District Court
reinstated a sentence against Mr. Salah Hamouri originally issued in 2005 and
ordered him to serve the remaining three-month sentence. This represents the
time that was left for Mr. Salah Hamouri to serve prior to his release as part
of the Wafa Al Ahrar exchange deal (see background information). A
representative from the French Consulate in Jerusalem and Mr. Salah Hamouri’s
father were prevented from entering the courtroom.
 
Mr. Salah
Hamouri is accused by Israeli authorities of being a member of the Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP).
 
In
addition, Mr. Salah Hamouri’s wife, Ms. Elsa Lefort a French national, is
currently banned by Israeli authorities from entering Palestine.
 
The
Observatory condemns the arbitrary detention and judicial harassment of Mr. Salah Hamouri as it appears to be a
form of retaliation for his human rights activities, in particular with
Palestinian political prisoners.
 
The
Observatory urges Israeli authorities to immediately release Mr. Salah Hamouri,
to put an end to all forms of harassment, including at the judicial level,
against him and members of his family. 
 
Background information:
 
On March
13, 2005, Mr. Salah Hamouri was arrested by the Israeli military at Qalqiliya
checkpoint and sentenced to seven years in prison for his alleged involvement
in a plot to assassinate Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, spiritual leader of the religious and
ultra-orthodox party Shas, and former Chief Rabbi of Israel.
 
Mr. Salah
Hamouri was to be released on March 13, 2012, but instead, was set free on
December 18, 2011, as part of the Wafa Al Ahrar prisoner exchange deal[2].
 
On August
23, 2017, Mr. Salah Hamouri was arrested from his house in Jerusalem by the
Israeli Army.
 
On August
29, 2017, the Jerusalem Magistrate Court ordered the conditional release of Mr.
Salah Hamouri and his placement under house arrest in Al-Reineh for 20 days.
The Court also banned Mr. Salah Hamouri from entering Jerusalem, from
travelling outside the country for three months and ordered a 10,000 NIS
(approx. 2642 Euros) bail.
 
When Mr.
Salah Hamouri’s family went to pay the bail, they were told he would not be
released and had received a six-months administrative detention order.
 
Actions requested:
 
Please
write to the authorities of Israel urging them to:
 
i.     
Immediately and unconditionally release Mr. Salah Hamouri as well
as all detained human rights defenders in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian
Territory;
 
ii.    
Put an end to all forms of harassment, including at the judicial
level, against Mr. Salah Hamouri, his family, as well as against all human
rights defenders in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory;
 
iii.  
Comply with the
provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the
General Assembly on December 9, 1998, in particular Articles 1 and 12.2;
 
iv.   
More generally,
ensure in all circumstances the respect for human rights and fundamental
freedoms throughout Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory in accordance
with international human rights instruments.

Addameer (Arabic for conscience) is a Palestinian NGO that works to support
Palestinian political prisoners held in Israeli and Palestinian prisons
offering free legal aid to political prisoners, advocating their rights at the
national and international level, and working to end torture and other
violations of prisoners' rights.

On October 18, 2011, 477 Palestinian prisoners were released from Israeli
prisons as part of an exchange deal in which Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, who
had been abducted by Hamas in 2006, was released. Several of the freed
Palestinian prisoners have been re-imprisoned since then.
