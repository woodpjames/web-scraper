Today, March 21, 2013, the United
Nations (UN) Human Rights Council gave a strong response to the increasing
trend of curtailing - when not criminalizing - the activities of human rights
defenders by limiting their right to access funding, especially when they come
from foreign countries. The Council adopted by consensus an 

unprecedented
resolution, introduced by Norway and co-sponsored by 70 States, affirming that
“no law should criminalise or de-legitimise activities in defence of human
rights on account of the origin of funding”.
 
“This is a strong signal of support sent by the United
Nations to the defenders around the world who are prevented from funding their
activities, de-legitimised and often criminalised for their human rights work”, declared Souhayr Belhassen, FIDH President. 
 
“We welcome the adoption of this important resolution,
through which the UN Human Rights Council is calling for stronger protection for those
actors for change and the guarantors of a free society”, said Gerald
Staberock, OMCT Secretary General. “States
have the responsibility to abide by the resolution and ensure that human rights
NGOs are enabled to access funding, as such restrictions clearly aim at
silencing them”, he added.
 
This
resolution confirms and reinforces the previous conclusions of UN human rights
mechanisms affirming the non-compliance of restrictive and repressive practices
and laws with international human rights law. This was illustrated recently by
the decision of the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (WGAD) on Ales
Bialiatski’s case, which stated that Belarus was in breach of its international
obligations in interfering in the funding of human rights NGOs' activities and
requested Belarus to release him immediately. 

 
All
relevant UN mechanisms should now build on this text to enhance the protection
of human rights defenders targeted by legislations and practices curtailing
their legitimate activities in many countries. 
 
According
to Olga Abramenko, ADC Memorial Director in Saint-Petersburg, “the new laws
adopted in the Russian Federation to regulate NGOs are used to attack the civil
society: right now in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other places of Russia many
independent NGOs are simultaneously being checked by the police, prosecutors
and even tax and fire inspections, with a special focus on sources of funding.
It is an obvious repressive campaign against human rights defenders, and it is
important to have international solidarity and support”. Ziad Abdel Tawab,
Deputy Director of the Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies added that: “While it is a positive step that Egypt is a
co-sponsor to this resolution; Egypt should live up to its obligations and
immediately repeal the draconian draft legislation on NGOs currently discussed
at the Upper House that aims at strangling the work of national and
international civil society”.
 
The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of
the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation
Against Torture (OMCT), has recently released a

comprehensive
study on restrictions on human rights defenders’ access to funding, which demonstrates how NGOs’ access to funding, in
particular foreign funding, is increasingly being hindered by governments
around the world. States resort to restrictive laws, smear campaigns
and judicial harassment against human rights defenders as a way to
stifle any criticism, such as in Algeria, Bahrain,
Bangladesh, Belarus, Egypt, Russia, but also Azerbaijan, Ethiopia, India, and
many others in all regions in the world.For more information, see also: http://www.omct.org/human-rights-defenders/statements/2013/03/d22172/
