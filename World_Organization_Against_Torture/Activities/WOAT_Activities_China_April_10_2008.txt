Brief description of the situation The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by The Tibetan Centre for Human Rigths and Democracy (TCHRD), member of OMCT SOS-Torture network, about the arbitrary arrest of seven monks of Labrang Monastery in Sangchu County, Kanlho Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture “TAP”, Gansu Province, namely Gendun Gyatso (30 years old), Gyurmey (40 years old), Gelek Gyurmey (30 years old), Sangay (30 years old), Samten (32 years old), Yonten (34 years old), and Thabkhey (30 years old) on 1 April 2008 by members of the People’s Armed Police and officials of the Public Security Bureau. While Thabkhey was later released (exact date currently unknown), the current whereabouts of the six others are unknown. According to the information received, Thabkhey was released in a very poor state of health. He reportedly has bruise marks all over his body and he is currently mentally unstable, indicating that he may have been severely beaten during his detention. According to the same information, the seven monks were arrested for having protested on 14 March 2008 in Sangchu County, during which they reportedly displayed the banned Tibetan national flag. At the time of their arrest, they were reportedly asked where they did get the flags from and who motivated them to protest. The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned for the safety of Gendun Gyatso, Gyurmey, Gelek Gyurmey, Sangay, Samten and Yonten, whose whereabouts are currently unknown and who, according to the information received, were arrested and detained solely for their peaceful political and religious beliefs and the rights to freedom of expression, association and assembly. OMCT fears that they may be subject to torture and ill-treatment. OMCT is also very much concerned for the physical and psychological integrity of Thabkhey. OMCT recalls that China is a State party to the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment which prohibits torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. In line with their obligations under this treaty, it is incumbent on the Chinese authorities to consider seriously any allegations of torture and ill-treatment, and to undertake a thorough and impartial investigation in this regard. OMCT urges the authorities to conform with China’s international human rights obligations, commitments that were reaffirmed on the occasion of its election as a member of the new United Nations Human Rights Council. Actions Requested Please write to the authorities in the People’s Republic of China urging them to:   Immediately locate the whereabouts of Gendun Gyatso, Gyurmey, Gelek Gyurmey, Sangay, Samten and Yonten;  Guarantee, in all circumstances, the physical and psychological integrity of Gendun Gyatso, Gyurmey, Gelek Gyurmey, Sangay, Samten, Yonten and Thabkhey;  Order the immediate release of Gendun Gyatso, Gyurmey, Gelek Gyurmey, Sangay, Samten and Yonten in the absence of valid legal charges, or, if such charges exist, bring them before an impartial, independent, competent and fair tribunal and guarantee their procedural rights at all times;  Guarantee immediate and unconditional access to their lawyers, families and any medical treatment they may require;  Order a thorough and impartial investigation into these events in order to identify all those responsible, bring them to trial and apply the penal and/or administrative sanctions as provided by law;  Guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
