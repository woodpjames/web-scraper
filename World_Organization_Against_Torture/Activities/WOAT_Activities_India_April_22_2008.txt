New information: The Observatory has been informed by People’s Watch about the release of all participants to “The Long March for Justice for Special Task Force (STF) Victims”, which was organised in the framework of the Campaign for Relief and Rehabilitation of Victims of the STF violence (torture, cruel and inhumane treatment, degrading punishment, disappearances, extra judicial killings, custodial rapes, arbitrary detention and so on) in the States of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.  According to the information received, all the participants to “The Long March for Justice for Special Task Force (STF) Victims”, who had been arrested on April 21, 2008, were released on the same day by midday. Furthermore, on April 21, 2008, the issue of compensation of all STF victims was raised in the State Assembly by Mr. G. K. Mani, a Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) of the Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) party, from Kolathur constituency. In response, the Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi said that compensation for an amount of INR one crore fifty lakhs (approx) had already been given to the STF victims by the Tamil Nadu Government and assured that if any one had been left off from the list, they would be given compensation. Subsequently, the Campaign for the Relief and Rehabilitation of STF Victims from Tamil Nadu and Karnataka called a planning meeting at Kolathur, which was attended to by members from the PMK, the Communist Party of India, the Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Party, Tamilnadu Muslim Munnetra Kazhagam, the Society for Community Organisation Trust (SOCO Trust) and People’s Watch. It was then decided to suspend the Long March in view of the assurance of the Chief Minister on the floor of the Tamil Nadu State Assembly to consider all STF victims for compensation The Observatory welcomes the release of all demonstrators, and thanks all the persons, institutions and organisations who intervened in their favour. Background information: On April 20, 2008, the Long March for Justice for STF Victims started at Sathyamangalam in Erode District, Tamil Nadu, although it was denied police permission. First, a public meeting was held at the New Bus Stand in Sathyamangalam at 9.30. a.m. Then, a crowd of 500 persons, among whom leaders of political parties, STF victims and members of the Campaign for the Relief and Rehabilitation of STF Victims from Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, began their long march. At the outskirts of Sathyamangalam, police officers stopped the marchers and prevented them from going further. Four hundreds of the marchers, including Messrs. Henri Tiphagne, Executive Director of People’s Watch, Mahaboob Batcha, Managing Trustee of the Society for Community Organisation Trust (SOCO Trust), and V.P. Gunasekaran, District Secretary of the Communist Party of India, were arrested and brought under police custody at the Ramasamy Goundar Maryammal Wedding Hall in Sathyamangalam. On the evening of April 20, 2008, at 5.45 p.m., the police released the mass protesters. Immediately after being released, the demonstrators moved to Anthiyur to participate in a public meeting, which had an audience of over 1,000 people. The Joint Committee[1] then decided to continue the Long March for Justice for STF Victims. On the next day, media reported that a clarification had been given by the Government of Tamil Nadu regarding the issue, saying that compensation had already been given to the victims and the Government of Tamil Nadu has done its duty. In the early morning of April 21, 2008, the local police informed the organisers of the March that they had been given instructions to arrest them if they started the March. At 9.30 a.m., the protestors were stopped by the police who announced that they were going to arrest them. When asked for the grounds of arrest, the policemen floundered for some time and later came up with a document that was vague and went on to arrest 115 marchers, including 38 women and one child. The arrestees have been lodged in Soudeeswari Amman Wedding Hall in Anthiyur.
