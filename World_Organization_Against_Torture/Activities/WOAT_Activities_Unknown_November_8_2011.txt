PRESS RELEASE - THE OBSERVATORY

EASTERN EUROPE AND CENTRAL ASIA: Human
rights defenders under pressure6-minutes
documentary film on obstacles to freedoms of assembly and association,
hindrances to NGO registration, criminalisation of unregistered organisations,
obstacles of access to funding, judicial harassment and arbitrary detentions
Paris-Geneva,
November 7, 2011. The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders,
a joint programme of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and
the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), is releasing today a six-minute
documentary drawing a dark picture of the situation of human rights defenders
in the Eastern Europe and Central Asia, in a context where the latter are
confronted to increasing repression.
This
film is made up of a series of analytical interviews of human rights defenders
from Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Poland, the Russian
Federation, Ukraine and Uzbekistan, taken on the margins of
the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Human Dimension
Implementation Meeting (HDIM) in Warsaw, from September 26 to 29, 2011. 

The
most recent example of repression of civil society activists in the region is
the case of Mr. Ales Bialatski, FIDH Vice-President and Viasna
President, currently arbitrarily detained in relation with his human rights
activities, and whose trial is presently taking place in Minsk. 
In
many States of the OSCE region, human rights defenders are facing similar harsh
repression: obstacles to freedoms of assembly and association, hindrances to
NGO registration, criminalisation of unregistered organisations, obstacles of
access to funding, judicial harassment and arbitrary detentions. 
Interviewees
outline the restrictive environment in which they operate, and the main trends
of repression they are confronted to.

documentary is available in :
