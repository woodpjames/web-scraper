the world, human rights defenders are increasingly stigmatized,
intimidated, threatened, and subjected to multifaceted repression,
from judicial harassment to arbitrary arrest and detention. As civil
society space is shrinking and laws restricting freedoms of
expression, association and peaceful assembly multiply, including
under the guise of national security and counter-terrorism, state
authorities legitimize the targeting of human rights defenders,
sometimes by portraying them as “foreign agents” or “enemies of
development.” As a result, human rights defenders suffer not only
abuses of power but also attacks against their physical integrity.
And some pay the ultimate price – torture, disappearance or
assassination – for pursuing their activities. As
documented by the Observatory
for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders,
a joint programme of FIDH
and OMCT,
the scale of attacks against economic, social and cultural rights
(ESCR) defenders, in particular land rights defenders, is worrying,
as is the widespread impunity in relation to these attacks. For
several years, the Observatory has made this matter a priority area
for action. In 2014, it published
“We
Are Not Afraid,”
a comprehensive
survey of attacks against land rights defenders in order to raise the
alarm on their situation and to call for concerted action as well as
strengthened mechanisms to protect them at the national, regional and
international levels.
As
the 31st
session of the Human Rights Council (HRC 31)
is about to open, FIDH and OMCT call on member and observer states of
the Council to work towards the adoption of a strong resolution on
economic, social and cultural rights defenders, which would inter
alia:
-
Highlight the legitimate work carried out by human rights defenders,
including those working to promote and protect economic, social and
cultural rights, and the need for their protection from harassment,
repression and attacks from state and non-state actors; 

-
Denounce the impunity that prevails with regard to these attacks, and
urge states to hold those responsible to account, provide victims
with effective remedies, and create and maintain a safe and enabling
environment for civil society and human rights defenders as well as
human rights advocacy; 

-
Enshrine the principle of
consultation with affected populations prior to carrying out
development projects, and their free, prior and informed consent
(FPIC), as well as the need to conduct a human rights impact
assessment (HRIA) prior to the start of any business operation that
is likely to have an effect on the enjoyment of any human right, and
highlight the essential role of human rights defenders as
interlocutors of their communities; 

-
Urge states to adopt effective
legal and policy frameworks to ensure the free exercise of the rights
to information, meaningful participation and peaceful protest and the
protection of human rights defenders from harassment and attacks;
-
Highlight the need to support human rights defenders, including ESCR
defenders, including where necessary by providing them with specific
technical and financial support; and 


-
Work towards the establishment of a clear and strong agenda at the
regional and international levels that guarantees greater protection
and empowerment in an enabling environment, and strengthens domestic,
regional and international protection mechanisms, including with
regard to access to remedies.
The
adoption of such a resolution by the Human Rights Council would be
timely. Beyond the extreme relevance of the topic, as shown by the
deteriorating situation of ESCR defenders, the promotion and
protection of economic, social and cultural rights are intertwined
with the UN's new sustainable development goals (SDGs), as well as
with the mounting pressure for a democratic governance of
development, trade and investment relations, and with the business
and human rights agenda.
The
international community needs a paradigm shift. Human rights and
human rights defenders must be placed at the center of discussions on
development, trade, investment and business activities and relations.
At HRC 31, the Human Rights Council should adopt
a strong, substantial resolution to act as a sounding board for
national, regional and global efforts to protect human rights
defenders, including economic, social and cultural rights defenders.
