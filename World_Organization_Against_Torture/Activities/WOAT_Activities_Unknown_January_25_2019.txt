New informationIRN 005 / 1118 / OBS 138.1Sentencing / Arbitrary detentionIranJanuary 25, 2019The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint
partnership of FIDH and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), has
received new information and requests your urgent intervention in the following
situation in Iran.New information:The Observatory has been informed by the League for the Defence of Human
Rights in Iran (LDDHI) about the sentencing and ongoing arbitrary detention of
Mr. Farhad Mayssami (a.k.a Meysami), a medical doctor who has campaigned
for women’s rights, including supporting a campaign against the imposition of
the hijab on women and girls, and defending the right of women to choose their
own clothing.According to the information received, on January 22, 2019, Mr.
Mayssami’s lawyer was notified that Branch 15 of the Islamic Revolution Court
in Tehran sentenced his client to six years of imprisonment - five years for “gathering and
collusion with intent to commit crimes against national security” (Article 610
of the Islamic Penal Code) and one year for “spreading propaganda against the
system” (Article 500 of the Islamic Penal Code). He was also banned from
“membership in social and political groups and parties, undertaking activities
in cyberspace, the media and the press” and from travelling abroad for two
years. Mr. Mayssami will appeal the court’s decision.Mr.
Mayssami has been arbitrarily detained since July 31, 2018 in Tehran’s Evin
prison, where he ended a five-month hunger strike on December 23, 2018 (see
background information).The Observatory expresses its deepest concern
regarding Mr. Farhad Mayssami’ physical integrity and psychological well-being
and condemns his sentencing and continuing arbitrary detention, which seem only
aimed at punishing him for his legitimate human rights activities.The Observatory urges the Iranian authorities to
immediately and unconditionally release Mr.
Farhad Mayssami, and to put an end to all acts of harassment, including at the judicial level,
against him and all human rights defenders in the country.Background information:On July 31, 2018, Mr. Farhad Mayssami was
arrested at his office in Tehran following an order of the Prosecutor’s Office
Branch 2. He was taken to the Ministry of Intelligence-run Ward 209 within
Tehran’s Evin prison. A friend of the prominent human rights lawyer Ms. Nasrin
Sotoudeh, Mr. Farhad Mayssami was arrested for being in possession of
copies of two books - “Small Acts of Resistance” by Steve Crawshaw and John
Jackson, and a book on human rights translated by Mohammad Jafar Pouyandeh, a
translator and writer assassinated by Ministry of Intelligence agents in 1998 -
and a number of badges reading “I am opposed to forced hijab”.He was detained on charges of “gathering and
colluding against national security” (Article 610 of the Islamic Penal Code),
“spreading propaganda against the system” (Article 500) and “spreading
prostitution” (Article 286).Mr. Mayssami was denied access to a lawyer
of his choosing, namely Mr. Arash Kaykhosravi (who was later
arrested in front of the Parliament on August 18, 2018)[1].On August 1, Mr. Mayssami started a hunger
strike to protest against his detention and called for the unconditional
release of fellow human rights defenders Ms. Nasrin Sotoudeh[2] and Mr. Reza Khandan[3]. He was placed in solitary confinement for 20
days before being transferred to a dormitory ward in Section 4 of Evin prison. His
health rapidly deteriorated and he lost 34 kg.On
September 26, 2018, he was forcibly transferred to the Evin prison clinic, and
subsequently placed in solitary confinement and administered
intravenous fluids against his will. Following Mr. Reza Khandan’s release
on bail on December 23, 2018, Mr. Farhad Mayssami ended his hunger strike.On
November 29, 2018, five United Nations Special Procedures’ mandate holders
called on Iran to “guarantee the rights of human rights defenders and lawyers
who have been jailed for publicly supporting protests against the mandatory
wearing of the hijab”
and expressed their particular concern over the critical health of Mr. Farhad
Mayssami[4].Actions requested:Please write to the authorities of Iran asking them to:i.
Guarantee in all circumstances the physical integrity and psychological
well-being of Mr. Farhad Mayssami and all human rights defenders in Iran;ii.
Immediately and unconditionally release Mr. Farhad Mayssami and put an end to
all acts of harassment, including at the judicial level, against him as well as
all human rights defenders in the country; iii.
