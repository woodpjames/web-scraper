Death threats / Continued intimidation
Zimbabwe
March 2, 2010
The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), has received new information and requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in Zimbabwe.
New information:
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about new threats received by Messrs. Okay Machisa, Nunurai Jena, Netsai Kaitano and Jabilusa Tshuma, respectively Executive Director, Regional Chairperson for Mashonaland West, Regional Chairperson for Chitungwiza and Treasurer of the Zimbabwe Human Rights Association (ZIMRIGHTS), an organisation which carries out, in particular, intensive civic education in the communities and campaigning on the right of people to be involved in the drafting of the new Constitution.
According to the information received, on February 25, 2010, Messrs. Nunurai Jena, Netsai Kaitano and Jabilusa Tshuma received different anonymous messages on their cell phones ordering them to put an end to their work on the constitution making process and threatening them with death. The messages also asked them about their motives to work within the association. All the messages were sent from the same number which is now unreachable. Mr. Okay Machisa also received a threatening message telling him to stay out of the country. The message said: “You enjoy flying in and out of the country demonizing your country, why don't you go and stay there? They monitor, soon you will all stay out”.
On March 2, 2010, ZimRights filed a police report under number IR 030 117. The police should open an investigation in the best delays.
The Observatory expresses its deepest concern about these continuing threats against members of ZIMRIGHTS, which seem to merely aim at silencing them due to their human rights activities.
The Observatory therefore urges the Zimbabwe authorities to guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of all ZIMRIGHTS members and to carry out an immediate, thorough and impartial investigation into the above-mentioned fact, in order to identify those responsible.
Background information:
On February 16, 2010, Mr. Machisa received by email an anonymous message from a person identifying himself as Dzapasi Mumunda warning him to be careful with his work. The message said “Be careful my friend a number of people at my workplace have been assigned to bring you down. I refused to be involved. Be careful especially at your home”.
On November 2009, several armed men waited at his home’s gate as he returned from a meeting. They left after Mr. Machisa alerted the police and colleagues.
Actions requested:
Please write to the authorities of Zimbabwe asking them to:

 Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Messrs. Okay Machisa, Nunurai Jena, Netsai Kaitano and Jabilusa Tshuma as well as all ZIMRIGHTS members and all human rights defenders in the country;
 Order an immediate, thorough, effective and impartial investigation into the above-mentioned events, the result of which must be made public, in order to identify all those responsible, bring them before a civil competent and impartial tribunal and apply to them the penal sanctions provided by the law;
 Put an end to any kind of intimidation and threats against Messrs. Okay Machisa, Nunurai Jena, Netsai Kaitano and Jabilusa Tshuma as well as against all human rights defenders in Zimbabwe;

 More generally, ensure in all circumstances the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with international and regional human rights instruments ratified by Zimbabwe.
