The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in Uganda.
Brief description of the information:
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the arbitrary detention of Mr. Mbugua Mureithi, Kenyan human rights lawyer who represents families of Kenyan suspects transferred to Uganda on allegations of involvement in the 11 July terrorist bombings in Kampala and Coordinator of the Litigation Fund Against Torture (LIFAT) and Mr. Al-Amin Kimathi, the Executive Coordinator of the Kenyan Muslim Human Rights Forum (MHRF) and about the subsequent release of Mr. Mbugua Mureithi.
According to the information received, on September 15, 2010, Messrs Mureithi and Kimathi were arrested upon their arrival at the Entebbe international airport by Ugandan Government agents. Mr. Murethi and Mr Kimanthi were taken to the headquarters of the Ugandan Police's Rapid Response Unit in Kireka, a suburb of Kampala, and detained there. They were questioned by individuals in civilian clothing about alleged contacts with Al-Shabaab operatives, an islamist group which claimed responsibility in the terrorist bombings perpetrated in Kampala on July 11, 2010.
On September 18, Mr. Mureithi was released and escorted to Entebbe to take a plane to Kenya in the morning. During his detention, Mr. Mureithi did not have access to a lawyer and was not allowed to make any phone calls. Mr. Al-Amin Kimathi, whose laptop has been confiscated, remains in detention with no access to a lawyer and no authorisation to make any phone call.
On September 20, Mr. Al-Amin Kimathi was brought before the Nakawa Chief Magistrate's Court in Kampala and charged with terrorism, attempted murder and 89 counts of murder in relation to the July 11 bombings. The Magistrate's court does not have jurisdiction to try him on those charges - murder and terrorism are capital offences - but the charges were read out to him and he was remanded to Luzira maximum security prison. The next hearing will take place on October 8.
Messrs Mureithi and Kimathi were arrested as they were travelling to Kampala to attend a court hearing in connection with the Kampala bombings of June 11. The trial was scheduled on September 16. and Mr. Mureithi was to represent Kenyan civilians transferred from their country to Uganda for having allegedly participated in the bombings. Mr. Kimathi and the MHRF are known for denouncing the human rights violations perpetrated in the name of the fight against terrorism in the East and Horn of Africa.
The Observatory denounces the arbitrary arrests of Messrs Mureithi and Kimathi as well as the continued arbitrary detention of Mr. Kimathi, which seem to aim at sanctioning their human rights activities, and fears for their physical and psychological integrity.
Actions requested:
Please write to the authorities of Uganda , urging them to:

 Proceed to the immediate release of Mr. Al-Amin Kimathi and guarantee in all circumstances his physical and psychological integrity as well as of all human rights defenders in Uganda ;
