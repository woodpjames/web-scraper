His trial was ongoing as of December 10, 2007; Mr. Mukhitdinov Dilmurod, head of the human rights society “Ezgulik” in the Markhamat district of Andijan region, arrested in July 2005 and sentenced on January 12, 2006 by the Chirchik city court (Tashkent region) to five years of imprisonment.  According to Articles 1 and 2 of the amnesty decision, women, persons over 60 years old or under 18 years old at the time of the sentencing, as well as persons who “committed involuntary offenses or offenses that do not endanger public security” shall be released, together with “those who were suffering from serious diseases one year at least before the entry into force [of the amnesty decision]” (Article 3) and “those who expressed their intention to “correct their behaviour”, and were sentenced for the first time to less than 10 years’ imprisonment for taking part in illegal organisations and/or for developing activities “endangering public security” (Article 5)[5]. Accordingly, the Observatory calls upon your administration to:  Release immediately and unconditionally the above-mentioned defenders, as well as all human rights defenders in Uzbekistan; Refrain from undertaking further acts of harassment, including judicial harassment, against human rights defenders in Uzbekistan; Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels” and article 12.2, which states that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”; Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by Uzbekistan.  The Observatory also points out that many human rights defenders who were amnestied in 2005, among them Messrs. Abdugafur Dadaboev, head of the NGO Ezgulik for the Andijan region, and Musajon Bobojonov, an independent journalist and human rights defender, remain under constant surveillance by the authorities, their moves and phone conversations being constantly monitored. The Observatory therefore also urges your administration to refrain from harassing human rights defenders that benefited from the amnesty in the past.

[1] Mr. Khamroev had been arrested on August 2, 2006 and charged with “hooliganism” under article 277 of the Uzbek Criminal Code. He had been sentenced to three years in prison by the Court of Djizak on September 24, 2006 and was reportedly ill-treated on several occasions in the framework of his detention (See Observatory Urgent Appeal UZB 002/0806/OBS 095.4).  [2] Mr. Zaynobitdinov had been arrested on May 21, 2005, and detained incommunicado for his denunciation and declarations to the international media concerning the Andijan events of May 2005. He was sentenced on January 11, 2006 to 7,5 years of imprisonment for libel (article 139 of the Criminal Code) by the Toytepa city court (Tashkent region). See Observatory Annual Report 2006. [3] Mrs. Niyazova had been arrested on December 26, 2006 at the Tashkent airport after Uzbek authorities had examined her laptop and declared that it contained “anti-constitutional” and “religious” material. On May 1, 2007, the Tashkent’s Sergeli District Court had sentenced Mrs. Niyazova to seven years’ imprisonment for “illegally entering or illegally leaving the Republic of Uzbekistan” (Article 223 of the Penal Code), “preparing and distributing material which poses a threat to public order and security” (Article 244, Paragraph 1) and “smuggling” (Article 246). On May 8, 2007, the Tashkent Court had decided, in a hearing in appeal, to commute the prison sentence of Mrs. Niyazova to a seven years suspended sentence, with three years of probation. She was then released but had to report regularly to the neighbourhood police station, to notify the authorities about any change of residence, and to observe a daily curfew.
