New information The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by a reliable source and Antenna International, a member organisation of OMCT SOS-Torture Network, of the sentencing of Ms. Ni Yulan (47 years old), a Beijing-based housing rights activist and former lawyer who had been evicted forcefully and detained incommunicado, to two years’ imprisonment for “obstructing official business” by Xicheng District Court in Beijing, on 18 December 2008. According to the information received, only four persons related to Ms. Ni Yulan, including her daughter, were permitted to attend her trial. Ms. Ni Yulan’s husband, some relatives and thirty petitioners, who came in support, were barred from attending. According to the information received, her trial failed to meet minimum international standards for fair trial. It is not yet clear whether Ms. Ni Yulan will appeal the sentence. Ms. Ni Yulan remains detained in Xicheng District Detention Center. According to the same information, Ms. Ni Yulan was detained in solitary confinement between April and October 2008. She was only able to meet her lawyer once in October (he was later dismissed) before the trial and she has not been allowed to meet with her family since her detention. Furthermore, no investigation has been reportedly launched into the allegations of torture and ill-treatment suffered in April 2008 and Ms. Ni Yulan was denied medical treatment for a head injury she claimed to have been caused during the beatings. The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned for the safety of Ms. Ni Yulan. OMCT recalls that China is a State party to the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment which prohibits torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. In line with their obligations under this treaty, it is incumbent on the Chinese authorities to consider seriously any allegations of torture and ill-treatment, and to undertake a thorough and impartial investigation in this regard. OMCT urges the authorities to conform with China’s international human rights obligations, commitments that were reaffirmed on the occasion of its election as a member of the new United Nations Human Rights Council. Reminder of the Situation According to the information received, on 15 April 2008, dozens of workers and police knocked down a wall of Ms. Ni Yulan’s home. Police alleged that Ms. Ni Yulan beat a member of the demolition crew when trying to stop them. Ms. Ni Yulan reportedly did not receive any notification regarding the demolition of her home. According to the same information, on 29 April 2008, Ms. Ni Yulan was formally arrested on suspicion of "obstructing official business" by the Beijing Public Security Bureau (PSB) Xicheng District Sub-division. It is reported that, soon after she was taken into police custody on 15 April 2008, Ms. Ni Yulan was allegedly beaten and ill-treated at Xinjiekou Police Station in Beijing. Police reportedly confiscated her crutches and made her crawl when she had to use the bathroom. They further kicked her so severely that she reportedly fell unconscious for two days. Ms. Ni Yulan was transferred on 17 April 2008 to Xicheng District Detention Center. Her current condition is unknown as her family and lawyer were denied access since 4 July 2008. Moreover, while her trial was originally scheduled on 4 August 2008, it was reportedly abruptly postponed. According to Article 277 of the Chinese Criminal Law, Ms. Ni Yulan risks three years of fixed-term imprisonment, criminal detention, or control; or a sentence of a fine. Ms. Ni Yulan is known for her work assisting many victims of forced eviction in Beijing, many of whom were forced to move to make way for the Olympics facilities without fair compensation. On 27 April 2002, for filming the forced demolition of a Beijing home, Ms. Ni Yulan was reportedly beaten by police. The beating left the former lawyer disabled being unable to walk without crutches. On 27 September 2002, she was arrested when petitioning the Beijing National People's Congress Standing Committee about the police beating. She was convicted of "obstructing official business" and sentenced to one year in prison.
