Brief reminder of the situation   The International Secretariat of OMCT received reports from the  Public Committee Against Torture in Israel (PCATI), a member  of the OMCT network, that Bassam Na’im Ashak Natshe, I.D.  #982732596, a Hebron resident and father of four, was arrested  on 30 December 1999.    According to the information received, Bassam Na’im Natshe  was arrested and has been detained since in the GSS interrogation  Unit of the Shikma Detention Center in Ashkelon.  On 2 January  2000, the counsel for Mr. Natshe attempted to meet with him but  was informed by the Shikma Detention Center that an Order  Prohibiting Meeting with Counsel had been imposed through to  January 6 2000.    Therefore, on January 3, PCATI, through its attorney Na’il  Zahalka from the office of Attorney Andre Rosenthal, filed a  petition to the High Court of Justice demanding that the Order  Prohibiting Meeting with Counsel be lifted and that Mr. Natshe be  informed that he has legal representation.   New Information   The International Secretariat of OMCT has received further  information from PCATI that on 4 January the High court of  Justice refused to accept PCATI’s petition after reading the  confidential documents on Mr. Natshe’s case.  GSS lawyer,  attorney Aner Helmann assured the court that he will inform Mr.  Natshe that he is represented and by whom.  Allegedly he also  assured that he would inform Mr. Natshe that a petition was filed  on his behalf and refused by the High Court of Justice on January  4.   On January 6, a military judge extended Mr. Natshe’s detention  by 20 days.  Attorney Na’il Zahalka was informed by the Shikma  Detention Center authorities, in a phone call he initiated, that the  Order prohibiting Meeting with Counsel was extended through 10  January.  On 11 January attorney Shai Nitsan from the Attorney  General’s office, informed attorney Na’il Zahalka that, contrary to  previous information, the Order Prohibiting Meeting with Counsel  was issued through 13 January.  Attorney Shai Nitsan added, that  on 13 January the GSS would decide whether to extend it again.     Therefore, on 12 January, PCATI, through its attorney Na’il  Zahalka from the office of Attorney Andre Rosenthal, filed a  second petition to the High Court of Justice demanding that the  Order Prohibiting Meeting with Counsel be lifted and that Mr.  Natshe be informed that he’s represented and by whom.   Mr. Natshe is still being held at the Shikma detention center.   Action requested   Please write to the authorities in Israel urging them to:   i.	guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of  Bassam Na’im Ashak Natshe;  ii.	ensure his immediate release if he is being held in  detention without any valid charges or, in the event  that there is, bring him immediately before a  competent and impartial tribunal and guarantee his full  procedural rights as well as their right to legal counsel  at all times, in conformity with the international human  rights standards;  iii.	guarantee all human rights and fundamental freedoms  in accordance with international human rights  standards.
