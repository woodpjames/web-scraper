Al-Zaitani were released on July 17 and July 18, 2015, respectively. Both had
been arbitrarily detained since February 2012, for promoting freedom of
expression and monitoring gross human rights violations committed in Syria. The
Observatory welcomes their release, but expresses its extreme concern for the
situation of their fellow colleague and Director of the Syrian Centre for Media
and Freedom of Expression (SCM), Mazen Darwish, who is still in prison.
While Mr. Darwish is listed in the amnesty decree granted on the
occasion of Eid al-Fitr, which involved prisoners prosecuted on terrorism
charges, the Director of SCM remains behind bars, despite the fact that his
colleagues, Messrs Hani Al-Zaitani and Hussain Ghrer have been
released.
On July 22, 2015, a verdict hearing in their trial, which had already
been rescheduled twenty-five times since February 2013, was once again
postponed and set for August 31, 2015. Therefore, despite the amnesty decree,
judicial harassment of the three human rights defenders does not seems to have
ended.
“While we welcome the long-awaited release of Hani Al-Zaitani and Hussain
Ghrer, the continued detention of Mazen Darwish and their ongoing judicial
harassment illustrate the completely arbitrary procedures the three human
rights defenders have faced since 2012,” declared FIDH President, Karim Lahidji.
Since the beginning of their detention, the three human rights defenders
were held in conditions amounting to enforced disappearance and subjected to
acts of torture on several occasions. Most recently, their whereabouts were
unknown from May 3, to June 30, 2015. To date, again, the legal status and
whereabouts of Mr. Darwish remained unclear.
“This amnesty is a smokescreen.
The bad faith of the Syrian authorities is unacceptable. Mazen Darwish should be released
immediately and unconditionally and all charges against the three human rights
defenders should be dropped,” added OMCT Secretary General, Gerald Staberock.
The Observatory recalls that the UN General Assembly, in Resolution 67/262 adopted on May 15, 2013, called for the release
of the three defenders. In January 2014, the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (WGAD) also found that the three defenders
had been arbitrarily deprived of their liberty due to their human rights
activities and called for their immediate release. Finally, UN Security Council Resolution 2139, adopted on February 22, 2014 also demanded the release
of all arbitrarily detained people in Syria.
The Observatory for
the Protection of Human Rights Defenders (OBS) was created in 1997 by FIDH
and the World
Organisation Against Torture (OMCT). The objective of this
programme is to intervene to prevent or remedy to situations of repression
against human rights defenders.
