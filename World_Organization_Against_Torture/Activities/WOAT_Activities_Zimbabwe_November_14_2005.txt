Brief description of the situation:The Observatory has been informed by Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights (ZLHR) about the arbitrary detention of Mrs. Netsai Mushonga, Coordinator of the Women’s Coalition, an umbrella body of women’s rights groups in Zimbabwe.  According to the information received, on November 8, 2005, Mrs. Netsai Mushonga was arrested, allegedly for convening a meeting at a local hotel for training women in using non violent means as a tool for dispute resolution under the banner of Women Peacemakers International. Ms. Mushonga was detained over night as the police were still working on the charges. On November 10, 2005, she was charged for contravening section 24 (6) of the Public Order and Security Act (POSA), which criminalises organising a political meeting without informing a regulatory authority, the police in this matter. On the same day, Mrs. Netsai Mushonga was released as the police indicated that they will proceed by way of summons, which means that once they have completed their investigations, they will summon her to appear in court.  The Observatory expresses its grave concern about the arbitrary detention of Mrs. Netsai Mushonga, as it violates the provisions of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 9, 1998, in particular article 5(a), which states that “for the purpose of promoting and protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms, everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, at the national and international levels to meet or assemble peacefully”. The Observatory is all the more worried that this arrest took place in the context of serious infringements the last days of the right to freedom of expression in Zimbabwe, and therefore urges the Zimbabwean authorities to release immediately and unconditionally Mrs. Netsai Mushonga.  Actions requested:Please write to the Zimbabwean authorities and ask them to: i. 	take all necessary measures to guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of Mrs. Netsai Mushonga, as well as all human rights defenders in Zimbabwe;  ii. 	ensure that she will be brought before an impartial tribunal, so that the charges against her be dropped, her prosecution being arbitrary;   iii. 	end all forms of harassment and ill-treatment of human rights defenders in Zimbabwe, and guarantee in all circumstances that human rights defenders and organisations are able to carry out their work without any hindrance;  iv. 	comply with the provisions of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 9, 1998, in particular article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually or collectively, to promote the protection and fulfilment of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, above-mentioned article 5(a), and article 12.2, which states that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure, adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”;  v. 	guarantee the respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and other international human rights instruments ratified by Zimbabwe.
