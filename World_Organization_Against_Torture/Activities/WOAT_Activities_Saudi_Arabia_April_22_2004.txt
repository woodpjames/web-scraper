New information:  The Observatory has been informed by a reliable source that nine of the twelve individuals who were arbitrarily arrested on March 15, 2004, have been released after pledging to end their participation in human rights activities in Saudi Arabia.  According to the information received, the twelve individuals arbitrarily arrested on March 15, 2004, because of their human rights work and efforts toward political reforms in Saudi Arabia, were held in incommunicado detention at the General Intelligence Department in “Ulayasha” prison in the capital Riyadh.  The individuals released are: -	Mr. Adnan Al-Shakhess, Mr. Abd Rab Al-Ameer Mussa Al-Bukhamseen, Mr. Khalid Al-Hameed and Mr. Hamad Al-Kanhel , released on March 17, 2004. -	Mr. Towfiq Al-Qaseer, released on March 17, but summoned for further questioning to the General Intelligence Department on March 18, 2004. Mr. Al-Qaseer was released again that same day. -	Mr. Najeeb Al-Khanizee, released on March 18, 2004. -	Mr. Abdul-Rahman Alahim, released on March 25, 2004. -	Mr. Mohammed Said Al-Taib and Mr. Shaikh Sulaiman Al-Rashoud, released on March 29, 2004.  Reportedly, authorities released these individuals after forcing them to sign a pledge in which they agree to end their participation in any political or human rights activities and to stop calling for reforms.  Mr. Abdulla Al-Hamad, Mr. Matrouk Al-Faleh and Mr. Ali Al-Deminy remain in incommunicado detention because of their refusal to sign the pledge. No charges have been filed against them. The Intelligence Department has also denied their request to have access to a lawyer.  The Observatory is extremely concerned for the physical integrity of the three individuals who remain in detention and urges the Saudi Arabian authorities to release them immediately and unconditionally. The Observatory is also concerned over the authorities’ use of coercion to force human rights defenders to end their activities.  Background information:  On March 15, 2004, the Saudi authorities detained twelve individuals because of their efforts to  improve the human rights and the political situation in Saudi Arabia. They were allegedly arrested  for: (1) criticizing the lack of independence of the National Commission on Human Rights; (2) submitting an application to form an independent human rights organisation to promote and protect human rights in Saudi Arabia; and (3) actively engaging in peaceful activities towards political reforms, democracy and respect of human rights, including the signing of the “Constitutional Kingdom” statement addressed to the Crown Prince Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz al-Saud, in December 2003.  Action requested:  Please write to the authorities of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia urging them to:  i.	guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Abdulla Al-Hamad, Mr. Matrouk Al-Faleh and Mr. Ali Al-Deminy and order their immediate and unconditional release;  ii.	ensure the right to form independent human rights organisations to promote and protect human rights in Saudi Arabia; iii.	conform to the provisions of the Declaration on Humans Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, in particular article 1, which states that "everyone has the right, individually or in association with others, to promote the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels"; iv.	ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards.
