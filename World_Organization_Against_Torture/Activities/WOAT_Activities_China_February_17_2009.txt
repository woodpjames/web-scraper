New Information The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by The Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy (TCHRD), a member of OMCT SOS-Torture Network, that, except for Gelek Kunga (26 years old), whose whereabouts still remain unknown, Sonam Tenpa (29 years old and brother of Lobsang Lhundup), Jampa Thokmey (30 years old), Lobsang Tenzin (23 years old), Lobsang Phendey (37 years old), Jampa Yonten (30 years old), Sanggey (29 years old), Jampa Tsering (28 years old), Lobsang Wangchuk (30 years old), Lobsang Tashi (21 years old), Gendun Choephel (30 years old), Dargye (37 years old), Gedhun (29 years old), Jampa (40 years old) and Amdo Gyaltsen are all detained at Lithang Tsagha Public Security Bureau (PSB) Detention Centre and their families were able to see them. According to the same source, five more Tibetans were arrested along with the fifteen above mentioned individuals during the 16 February 2009 peaceful protest demonstration in Lithang. They are: Damdul (the head of Dekyi Village in Lithang County), two Tibetan nomad women of Sako Village in Lithang County, Yanglo and Dolma, who were both reportedly released in the evening on 16 February, as well as two other Tibetans whose identities could not be ascertained at the time of issuing this urgent appeal. These latter and Damdul are also reportedly detained at Lithang Tsagha PSB Detention Centre. Lobsang Lhundup, a 38-year-old monk of Nekhor Monastery born in Gemo Village, who was arrested on 15 February 2009, remains reportedly detained at Lithang PSB Detention Centre The International Secretariat of OMCT remains gravely concerned for the safety of all the above mentioned individuals, fearing that they may be subjected to ill-treatment and torture, in particular of Gelek Kunga, whose whereabouts remain unknown. OMCT is also preoccupied with regard to their arrest, as according to the information received, it seems solely based on their peaceful political and religious beliefs and the exercise of their rights to freedom of expression. OMCT recalls that China is a State party to the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment which prohibits torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. OMCT urges the authorities to conform with China’s international human rights obligations, commitments that were reaffirmed on the occasion of its election as a member of the new United Nations Human Rights Council.

According to the information received, Lobsang Lhundup was arrested on 15 February 2009 for staging a peaceful solo protest demonstration at the main market square of Lithang town for about 15-20 minutes, chanting slogan “'Long Live the Dalai Lama, Independence for Tibet”, “Swift return of the Dalai Lama to Tibet'”and “No Losar (Tibetan New Year) celebration this year”. He was then reportedly forcibly detained by the Public Security Bureau (PSB) and People’s Armed Police (PAP) and taken to the Lithang PSB Detention Centre for further interrogation. According to the same information received, on 16 February 2009 in the morning, a group of fifteen Tibetans from Lithang County, namely Sonam Tenpa, Jampa Thokmey, Gelek Kunga, Lobsang Tenzin, Lobsang Phendey, Jampa Yonten, Sanggey, Jampa Tsering, Lobsang Wangchuk, Lobsang Tashi, Gendun Choephel, Dargye, Gedhun, Jampa and Amdo Gyaltsen, were also arrested after staging a similar peaceful protest march at Lithang main market square. Sonam Tenpa, who led the peaceful protest, was reportedly carrying a huge portrait of the Dalai Lama adorned with a traditional Tibetan scarf, while the group chanted slogans, “Long Live the Dalai Lama, Independence for Tibet”, “Swift return of the Dalai Lama to Tibet” and “ No Losar (Tibetan New Year) celebration this year”. According to the information, eyewitnesses to the scene reported that the group was brutally beaten, manhandled and forcibly loaded into military trucks by the Chinese PSB and PAP forces.
