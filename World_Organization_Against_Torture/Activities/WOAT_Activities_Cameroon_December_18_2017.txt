URGENT APPEAL - THE
OBSERVATORY

CMR 003 / 1217 / OBS 118
Arbitrary detention /
Judicial harassment
Cameroon
December 18, 2017
 
The Observatory for the
Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a partnership of FIDH and the World
Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent intervention in the
following situation in Cameroon.
 
Description
of the situation:
 
The Observatory has been informed by the Central
Africa Human Rights Defenders Network (REDHAC) about the arbitrary detention as
well as the judicial harassment of Mr. Alain Patrice Nganang, writer,
who has been particularly vocal on the “Anglophone crisis” in Cameroon[1].
Residing in the US, he had returned to Cameroon on October 27, 2017, to support
activists in the North-West and South-West regions of Cameroon and visited several
political prisoners.
 
According to the information received, on
December 15, 2017, after a fifteen minutes hearing before the tribunal de
première instance du Centre administratif de Yaounde, Mr. Alain Nganang was
formally charged with “contempt of a state constituent body” and “apology of
violence”. He
faces up to five years in prison. The next hearing is scheduled on December 19,
2017.
 
Mr. Alain Nganang has been detained
since his arrest on December 6, 2017, while boarding a flight to Harare at
Douala international airport. On December 14, 2017, Mr. Alain Nganang was
transferred to Yaoundé’s central prison of Kondengui where he remains detained
(see background information). 
 
At the time of this publication, Mr.
Alain Nganang was still denied family visit and attempts by human rights NGOs
to visit him were denied by prison authorities.
 
The Observatory recalls that on December
5, 2017, Mr. Alain Nganang had published an op-ed in newspaper Jeune Afrique, denouncing Paul Biya’s
government actions in the Anglophone regions of Cameroon[2].
 
The Observatory expresses its concerns
over the arbitrary detention and judicial harassment of Mr. Alain Nganang which
appears to be a retaliation of his peaceful and legitimate human rights
activities. Consequently, the Observatory urges Cameroonian authorities to
immediately and unconditionally release him and in the meantime to guarantee
his right to due process and fair trial. 
 
Background information:
 
On December 6, 2017, at 10am Mr. Alain
Nganang arrived at Douala international airport together with Mr. Gerald Kuissu
to board a flight to Harare where he was supposed to visit his family and hold
a series of conferences on the “Anglophone crisis”. As he was about to board
his flight, Mr. Alain Nganang was questioned by security officers and later
disembarked from the plane. He was later taken to a police station in Yaoundé. On
December 7, 2017, Mrs. Nganang, who was waiting for Mr. Alain Nganang in
Harare, called Mr. Gerald Kuissu to inform him that Mr. Alain Nganang had never
arrived in Harare. 
 
On December 7, 2017, Mr. Alain Nganang
was notified of accusations of “offending the President in a Facebook post”
pending against him.
 
Authorities confiscated the journalist's
phone and he was not granted access to legal counsel from December 6 to 8,
2017.
 
On December 9, 2017, Mr.
Alain Nganang was presented to the criminal police for audition.
 
On December 11, 2017, was presented to
the Public prosecutor in Yaoundé. The latter dropped the accusations of
“offending the President in a Facebook post”. However, Mr. Alain Nganang was
told to be facing charges of “illegal immigration” and “forgery”. 
 
Actions requested:
 
Please write to the
authorities of Cameroon and ask them to:
 
i. Immediately and unconditionally
release Mr.
Alain Nganang as
well as all human rights defenders arbitrarily detained in Cameroonian;
 
ii. Put an end to all acts of
harassment, including at the judicial level, against Mr. Alain Nganang as well as against all
human rights defenders in Cameroon;
 
iii.   In the meantime, ensure that Mr. Alain Nganang has full and unhindered access to his family and lawyers and guarantee his
right to due process and fair trial;
 
iv. Conform in any circumstances
with the provisions of the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights
Defenders, adopted on December 9, 1998 by the UN General Assembly, in
particular its Articles 1, 6(c) and 12.2;
 
v. Ensure in all circumstances
respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international
human rights instruments ratified by Cameroon.
