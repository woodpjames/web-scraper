ESCRC   The International Secretariat of OMCT requests your URGENT intervention in the following situation in India.  Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Indian Centre for Human Rights and the Law, a member of OMCT network, of the physical threatening and destruction of properties of Irula Adivasis (tribal peoples) in the Coimbatore District of Tamil Nadu.  It is reported that on March 25th 2001, the house of Mr. Ramaswamy, an Irula Adivasi activist, was completely burnt down. The burning of Mr. Ramaswamy’s house took place in a context of increasing pressure on the Irula Adivasis living in Thuvaipathy Village to end their opposition to the establishment of the “Coimbatore Zoological Park and Conservation Centre”. Along with the burning of the house, alleged physical threats against the Irula Adivasis by individuals related to the society in charge of establishing the Coimbatore Zoological Park and Conservation Centre” (the CZP) have also been reported.   The events of March 25th are taking place in a climate of  increased pressure by the authorities and the CZP on the Irula Adivasis to give up their claim to the Poramboke lands. It is reported that on March 18th 2001 the Revenue Divisional Officer first warned the Irula Adivasis of dire consequences if they did not give up their claims. This was followed, on March 21st 2001, by a second attempt by the Revenue Divisional Officer to coerce the Irula Adivasis, as about 21 Irula Adivasis men and women were brought to his office by the police in a car belonging to the CZP.   Reminder of the situation   According to the information received, the Coimbatore Zoological Park (CZP) is a registered society set up in 1986 by leading industrialist and businessmen of Coimbatore. The CZP proposes to establish the “Coimbatore Zoological Park and Conservation Centre” at Thuvaipathy Village, about 30 kilometres form Coimbatore City, in an area extending from 252 acres to 400 acres known as the Poramboke lands. The establishment of the “Coimbatore Zoological Park and Conservation Centre” would lead to the displacement of the Irula Adivasis living in the Thuvaipathy Village and the surrounding Poramboke lands.   Since 1987, the Irula Adivasis have been opposed to the establishment of the “Coimbatore Zoological Park and Conservation Centre”. From the time when the Irula Adivasis started resisting attempts to displace them, they faced repeated threats and destruction of their property. In particular, it is reported that:  -	on August 11th 1989, a team of officials belonging to the Survey Department destroyed the “sangapadi” (community meeting hall) and assaulted a 8 year old child who plucked out the flags planted by the officials;  -	in March 1991, the CZP commenced its operations and grabbed pieces of land using coercive measures whereas on May 6th 1990 the Collector, at that time Mr. A.M. Raman, promised that the project would not be sanctioned as long as the Irula Adivasis objected;  -	on October 15th and November 10th 1991, a gang of individuals working for the CZP demolished the houses of Vetain and Maruthan, both Irula Adivasis from Thuvaipathy Village, no concrete action was taken by the police.   According to information received, the CZP started fencing off the area in 1995, including the Poramboke lands, while in March 2001, the CZP commenced the process of physical possession of the Poramboke lands.   Action Requested  Please write to the Indian authorities urging them to:  i.	take all necessary measures to guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of the Irula Adivasis;  ii.	guarantee an immediate investigation into the circumstances of the burning of the house of Mr. Ramaswamy, identify those responsible, bring them before a civil competent and impartial tribunal and apply the penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions provided by law;  iii.	ensure Mr. Ramaswamy proper compensation for the loss of his house;  iv.	guarantee respect for the economic, social and cultural rights of the Irula Adivasis;  v.	guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards and in particular the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the ILO Convention No. 169.
