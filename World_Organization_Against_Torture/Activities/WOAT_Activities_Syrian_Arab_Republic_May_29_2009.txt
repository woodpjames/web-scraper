Brief description of the situation: The Observatory was informed by reliable sources about acts of judicial harassment and the ongoing arbitrary detention against Mr. Walid Al Bunni a member of the Association of Human Rights in Syria. According to the information received, on May 13 and 28, 2009, the Second Military Court of Damascus tried Mr. Walid Al Bunni, detained since December 17, 2007 in Adra Prison, for “weakening the national sentiment” by “issuing calls” or “spreading false or exaggerated information” (respectively Article 285 and 286 of the Syrian Criminal Code), punishable by up to 15 years’ imprisonment. On May 13, 2009, a first hearing took place, which was dedicated to the audience of Mr. Ashour Oqba, an inmate at Adra Prison, who accused Mr. Walid al-Bunni of having uttered insults and discussed with him about the Special Tribunal for Lebanon charged with the investigation into the assassination of Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri and the Syrian President, the head of the division of military intelligence, as well as about Syrian-Lebanese relations. On May 28, 2009, several defense witnesses confirmed that the accusations made against Mr. Al Bunni were false. The hearing was then adjourned to June 7, 2009, at the request of the Prosecutor General. The Observatory is deeply concerned by these acts of judicial harassment against Mr. Al Bunni and his ongoing arbitrary detention, which seem to aim at sanctioning his human rights activities. The Observatory therefore urges the Syrian judicial authorities to guarantee the right to a fair trial to Mr. Walid Al-Bunni, in line with international human rights standards. The Observatory recalls that Mr. Walid Al-Bunni was arrested on December 17, 2007, due to his involvement with the National Council of the Damascus Declaration for Democratic National Change (NCDD), a collective pro-rights and pro-democracy movement comprising more than 160 Syrian political activists, human rights defenders, intellectuals and artists, which met on December 1, 2007 to follow-up on the Damascus Declaration for Democratic National Change of October 16, 2005. After publishing its concluding statement, the NCDD was subject to crackdown by the authorities. Starting on December 9, 2007, 40 of its members were arbitrarily arrested by the Syrian State Security Intelligence. Twelve of them were tried on September 24, 2007, and remain detained as of today. Actions requested: Please write to the Syrian authorities, urging them to:   Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Walid Al Bunni;  Release Mr. Al-Bunni immediately and unconditionally since his detention is arbitrary as it only aims at sanctioning his human rights activities;  Put an end to any kind of harassment, including at the judicial level, against Mr. Walid Al Bunni as well as against all human rights defenders in Syria;  Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, and Article 12.2, which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”;  Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by the Syrian Arab Republic.
