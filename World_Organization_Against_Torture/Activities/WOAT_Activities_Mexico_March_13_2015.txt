Dear Mr Osorio
Chong, Mr Meade Kuribreña, Ms Gómez González, Mr Gónzalez Pérez, Mr Rúbido
García and Mr Ortega Martínez,
 
The undersigned organizations express deep
concern regarding recent reports that members of the Tlachinollan Human Rights
Centre, as well as other human rights organisations and the families and
friends of the 43 disappeared students from Ayotzinapa, continue to suffer
security incidents, putting their physical and psychological integrity at
risk.  
 
Defamations
In February 2015, several defamatory articles
were published in a newspaper, entitled El Financiero, which discredited
the work of Tlachinollan and other human rights defenders (HRDs), social
leaders and civil society organizations in the state of Guerrero[1]. Although
these latest articles targeted a broad number of civil society organisations,
it is not the first time that both Tlachinollan and other organizations that
accompany the families of the disappeared students have been targeted. On
December 10, 2014, the Secretary of the Marines (SEMAR), Vidal Francisco
Soberón stated during a public interview that the organizations that accompany
the family members of the disappeared of Ayotzinapa are manipulating them and
seek benefits for themselves in order to reach their own objectives[2]. Similarly,
in November 2014, Tlachinollan, the Civil Society Network of Guerrero and the
José María Morelos y Pavón Regional Human Rights Center were reportedly the
target of public defamation by authorities from Guerrero[3] and on
December 8, 2014, the digital newspaper Reporte Indigo published an
article based on leaked information presumably from the Center for
Investigation and National Security (CISEN) which links two members of the
Tlachinollan Human Rights Center with “subversive groups” from the state of
Guerrero[4]. It is worth
mentioning that the latest articles published in February 2015 are similar to
those previously published in November and December, as they also make
reference to “official documents” or information from the CISEN and link human
rights defenders to guerrilla groups and subversive movements. Such allegations
would suggest that federal resources are being allocated and used to
investigate HRDs in the state of Guerrero. 
 
Acts of Aggression 
On 12 January 2015, the Military Police
allegedly attacked some of the relatives of the 43 disappeared students while
they were protesting in front of the 27 Battalion Military Quarters in Iguala[5].  Similarly, on 14 December 2014, family
members and students were allegedly attacked by five drunken federal police
officers while preparing the “Light in the Darkness” concert[6]. In
February during a speaking tour to Geneva and Brussels, two parents of the
disappeared students also described regular surveillance and intimidation by
different state security forces during their protests. According to Mexican
civil society organizations, these events are part of a broader context of
increased restrictions on the right to protest and freedom of expression in
Mexico[7]. 
 
Precedents and context
In 2012, Tlachinollan lawyer Vidulfo Rosales
Sierra was forced to temporarily leave the country after receiving threats
linked to his work with students from the same Ayotzinapa teachers college. Due
to his extraordinary risk level, Rosales Sierra was awarded Provisional
Protection Measures from the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. 
Diverse organizations and international experts
have also recognized the adverse conditions in which human rights defenders
carry out their work in Guerrero and the obstacles that they face[8]. According
to the National Network of Human Rights Organizations “All Rights for Everyone”
(Red TDT) between 2011 and 2013, 10 human rights defenders were assassinated in
Guerrero and 21 suffered acts of aggression or death threats[9]. Indeed, on
13 February 2015, another activist was murdered[10]. 
In its concluding observations following a
review of the first report submitted by Mexico in February 2015, the UN
Committee on Enforced Disappearances highlighted the numerous cases and reports
it has received which described threats and attacks against relatives of
disappeared persons and human rights defenders working on this issue[11]. 
More generally and as recognized by the UN,
human rights defenders in Mexico work in a persistent climate of violence,
hostility and insecurity[12]. Local human
rights organizations report that cases of aggressions towards human rights
defenders have doubled over the past 4 years[13]. Impunity
prevails in more than 95 % of these cases[14].
 
The undersigned organizations believe that the
aforementioned examples of defamation, surveillance and acts of aggression
place both the family members of the 43 disappeared students, and the HRDs who
accompany them at increased risk and serve to obstruct their legitimate work.
Moreover, the stigmatisation and criminalisation of HRDs, social leaders and
the student community is deeply troublesome as it remains a breeding ground for
the perpetration of grave human rights violations in Guerrero and, in
particular, against the student community of the Normal Rural School of Ayotzinapa.
In the absence of a thorough and exhaustive investigation of the events of 26 –
27 September in Iguala, and the prosecution of the material and intellectual
actors responsible for these incidents, the security and protection of those
who continue to fight for justice in this case is likely to remain a matter of
deep concern.
We therefore call on the Mexican authorities
to: 
·      Take all
necessary measures to guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of
Vidulfo Rosales Sierra and other members of the Tlachinollan Human Rights
Centre, as well as other human rights defenders, and indeed the family members
of the 43 disappeared students, permitting them to continue in their fight for
justice and against impunity. Furthermore, we urge that the physical and
psychological integrity of those who exercise their right to peacefully protest
within the context of this case be guaranteed.
·      Continue
to investigate the events that occurred in Iguala on 26 – 27 September,
establishing with conclusive scientific proof, the whereabouts of the
disappeared students, as well as establishing the alleged involvement of the
authorities at all levels in these incidents and the chain of command of such
authorities.
·      Facilitate
the work of all independent international experts working on the case including
the Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team and the group of experts appointed by
the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights.   
·      Guarantee the protection of all
human rights defenders, including through statements of recognition of their
legitimacy, the sanctioning of all aggressions against them, the implementation
of adequate protective measures for victims and the full implementation of the
Law for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders and Journalists.

Judicial Section, Vidulfo Rosales Sierra and considers them “radical and
dangerous to the governability” of the country. The same article mentions
several other civil society organizations from Guerrero which are allegedly
surveilled and have files with CISEN.
