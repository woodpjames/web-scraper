Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by a Humanitarian Law Center, a member of the OMCT network, of the physical abuse against Mr. Munir Muriæ by a police officer in Tutin, Serbia.  According to the information received, on August 18th, 2003, Mr. Munir Muriæ was stopped by a police officer after having stopped to urinate behind a police checkpoint hut on his way from the market in Tutin around 7:00 p.m. Officer Omer Hadžiæ approached Muriæ and threatened him, saying "Do you know I have the right to beat you up?" to which Muriæ responded that Hadžiæ had no such right. Officer Hadžiæ responded by grabbing Muriæ’s arm, twisting it behind his back, and punching him. Muriæ asked to be left alone, saying that he had not committed any crime, and the officer said "Don't you know that a bomb went off here three nights ago?" As Hadžiæ led Muriæ into the hut, he swore at him and threatened him with imprisonment. Inside the hut, Muriæ was ordered to face the wall while Hadžiæ kneed him in the left led and thigh and repeatedly punched him in his sides.  The beating stopped when another police inspector entered the room. The unknown officer removed the handcuffs but did not respond when Muriæ complained of having been beaten. Officer Hadžiæ continued to insult Muriæ as he was leaving, saying that he was "whining like a whore." Muriæ has a medical certificate and photographs testifying to the injuries he sustained. On August 26th, the Sandžak Committee for Protection of Human Rights and Freedoms filed a criminal complaint against Officer Hadžiæ, charging him with civil injury and infliction of slight bodily injury.  The International Secretariat of OMCT is therefore gravely concerned for Mr. Munir Muriæ’s physical and psychological integrity. OMCT calls upon the Serbian authorities launch an immediate and impartial investigation into this incident in order to identify those responsible, bring them to justice and award adequate reparation to Mr. Muriæ.    Action requested  Please write to the authorities in Serbia urging them to:  i.   take all necessary measures to guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Muriæ ; ii.  guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards. iii. Take all necessary measures to ensure respect for the international human rights instruments in Serbia, which includes respect for the prohibition of torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment and punishment, such as the practice of corporal punishment.
