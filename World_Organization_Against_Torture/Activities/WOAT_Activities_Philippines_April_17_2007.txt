According to the information received, on April 12, 2007, while these three human rights activists were returning to their residence, they were stopped in Cabanbanan, Oton, Iloilo, by three armed men who shot several times against their vehicle and injured seriously Mr. Jose Ely Garachico, public information officer of KARAPATAN and member of Society of ex-Detainees for Liberation, Against Detention and for Amnesty (SELDA).

Mrs. Maria Luisa Posa-Dominado, also a member of SELDA, and Mr. Nilo Arado, member of the Peasant Movement of Philippines, were abducted on the spot.

According to the information received, Mr. Arado had already received death threats in December 2006 for his action in favour of a genuine agrarian reform while Mr. Garachico and Mrs. Posa-Dominado, participating in campaigns for the release of all political prisoners in Philippines, were known for their action against the use of torture.
