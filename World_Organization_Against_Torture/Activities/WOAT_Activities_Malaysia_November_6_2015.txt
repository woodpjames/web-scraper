The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of
the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation
Against Torture (OMCT) requests your urgent intervention in the following
situation in Malaysia.
 
Description
of the information:
 
The
Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the judicial harassment
of several members of the Coalition for Clean and Fair Elections (Bersih 2.0),
a coalition of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) created in 2006. Bersih
2.0 seeks to reform the current electoral system in Malaysia to ensure free,
clean, and fair elections and to promote the respect of democratic rights[1].
 
From
2 p.m. on August 29, 2015, to midnight on August 30, 2015, a massive rally,
dubbed Bersih 4.0, calling for democratic reforms in Malaysia was held in Kuala
Lumpur. Smaller rallies were held in other cities, including Kuching, Sarawak
State, and Kota Kinabalu, Sabah State.
 
According
to the information received, on November 3, 2015, the Kuala Lumpur Sessions Court charged Ms. Maria Chin Abdullah,
organiser of the Bersih 4.0 rally in Kuala Lumpur and Chairperson of Bersih 2.0,
under Article 9(5) of the 2012 Peaceful Assembly Act (PAA), for failing to give
notice to the Brickfields police 10 days prior to the 34-hour rally Bersih 4.0 in
Kuala Lumpur.
 
According to the information received, the Sessions
Court judge fixed bail at RM 5,000 (approx. 1,070 Euros). Ms. Maria Chin
Abdullah’s case will go to trial on December 11, 2015. She faces a maximum fine
of RM 10,000 (approx. 2,150 Euros), if convicted.
 
Ms. Chin Abdullah is not the only Bersih member to
be judicially harassed by the Malaysian authorities under the 2012 PAA. On October
21, 2015, the Magistrate Court charged Ms. Jannie Lasimbang,
Vice-chairperson of Bersih 2.0 and organising committee member of Bersih 4.0 in
Kota Kinabalu, Sabah State, on two counts under Article 9(5) of the 2012 PAA,
for having organised the August 2015 gathering at Taman Awam Teluk Likas Park
in Kota Kinabalu, without giving a 10-day notice to Kota Kinabalu City Hall
prior to the event. She was also charged for failing to submit a copy of the
consent letter from the owner or occupier of the place of assembly, as required
under Article 10(c) of the 2012 PAA. Ms. Lasimbang was also charged under Article 15(3) of the PAA for
organising the event without complying with the condition imposed by the city
police chief to obtain the approval of City Hall to assemble on certain days
and at certain times.
 
The Magistrate ordered Ms. Lasimbang to post bail
of RM 6,000 (approx. 1280 Euros) for both charges, with a deposit of RM 1,000
(approx. 215 Euros) for each charge, and set the trial for November 23 and 24,
2015. As in the case of Ms. Chin Abdullah, Ms. Lasimbang is liable to a maximum
fine of RM 10,000 (approx. 2,150 Euros) for each charge, if convicted.
 
The
Observatory strongly condemns the ongoing judicial harassment of Ms. Maria Chin
Abdullah and Ms. Jannie Lasimbang, which only aims at sanctioning their
legitimate human rights activities, and calls on the Malaysian authorities to
drop all charges against them.
