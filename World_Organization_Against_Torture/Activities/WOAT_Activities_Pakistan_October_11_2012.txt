The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of
the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation
Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent intervention in the following
situation in Pakistan.
 
Description
of the situation:
 
The
Observatory has been informed of the attempted assassination in
Mingora, Swat valley, North West Pakistan,of Malala Yousafzai, a 14 year-old
defender who has promoted the rights of girls.
 
In
the afternoon of October 9, 2012, Ms. Malala Yousafzai was shot in the head in
her school van. The Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) claimed responsibility for
the attack.
 
According
to the information received, Ms. Malala Yousafzai was reportedly shot by three
unidentified gunmen from the TTP, in the bus taking children home from school
after a mid-term exam. The incident occurred in the city of Mingora situated in
the Swat valley, North West Pakistan, as the bus was coming from Khushal Public
School. According to testimonies, the unidentified assailants got on the bus
and asked the other children to point to Malala. Ms Yousafzai was shot in the
head and a second shot injured her in the neck area. Two other girls were
reportedly also wounded in the attack but are now out of danger.
 
Ms.
Yousafzai was targeted for advocating the right of girls to education, and for
exposing the daily violence
and intimidation after the Taliban took
control of the Swat valley. She had been writing a blog for the BBC in
Urdu under the pen name “Gul Makai” since the age of 11. As the Taliban were
driven out of the Swat valley in 2009, her identity was made public. She
received the National Peace Award from former Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani on December 19, 2011, and was
nominated for the International Children's Peace Prize the same year by the
Dutch organisation “Kids Rights”. Ms. Yousafzai was also a speaker for the
Child Assembly in Swat, an initiative supported by UNICEF in 2011. She appeared
on national and international television to express her views on the rights of
children and girls. 
 
On
the day of the attack, spokesperson for the Pakistani Taliban, Ehsanullah
Ehsan, confirmed to international media that they attacked her because “she
[was] anti-Taliban and secular”, adding
that she “would not be spared. She was pro-West, she [was]
speaking against Taliban and she [was] calling President Obama her idol […]
She [was] young but she [was] promoting Western culture in Pashtun areas”,
he said. He reiterated the threats to kill her if she survives the attack.
 
Ms.
Yousufzai was reportedly carried to Saidu Sharif Medical Complex in Mingora
immediately after the incident and was later moved to Peshawar in an army helicopter.
She is now fighting for her life and could be flown abroad for further
treatment.  
 
District
Police Officer (DPO) from Swat region, Mr. Rasool Shah, said that a search
operation has been initiated in the area, and a number of suspects had been arrested.
A case was registered against the unidentified attackers under the
Anti-Terrorism Act at the Saidu Sharif Police Station.
 
Prime
Minister Raja Pervaiz Ashraf condemned the attack and called her “a daughter of
Pakistan.” On October 10, the Parliament of Pakistan unanimously passed a
resolution condemning the attack. 
 
The
Observatory condemns the assassination attempt of Ms. Yousafzai, which is
clearly linked to her human rights activities, and aims at silencing her. It
expresses its deepest concern for her life. 
 
Actions
requested: 

The Observatory urges the authorities of Pakistan to:
 
i.      Guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of Ms. Malala Yousafzai and, more

above-mentioned threats, in order to identify all those responsible, bring them
before a civil, competent and impartial tribunal, and apply to them the penal
sanctions provided by the law. 
 
iii.   Conform in any circumstances with the provisions of the Declaration on
Human Rights Defenders, adopted on December 9, 1998 by the United Nations
General Assembly, in particular: 
its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually or in

rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”;

states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with
others to study, discuss, form and hold opinions on the observance, both in law

these and other appropriate means, to draw public attention to those matters”;
-       
and its Article 12.2
which states that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the
protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in
association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto
or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a

present Declaration”.
