Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Greek  Helsinki Monitor, a member of the OMCT network, that the arbitrary  detention of unaccompanied minors seeking asylum in Greece continues.  According to the information received, eleven new cases of  unaccompanied minor detained together with adults in asylum seekers'  reception centres in Mytilini and Rhodes in Greece have been  recorded.   Four Afghan children are held in Mytilini reception centre:             ·	KHUDADAD AHMADI, child of AHMAD ALI  and QAMAR, born in 1988,  detained since 09/07/2003  ·	YASIN JAMALI , child of M.ABRAHIM and FATIMEH , born in 1986,  detained since 24/06/2003  ·	AHMAD MOSTAFA , child of SHAFIN NAJIBA , born in 1986, detained  since 05/07/2003  ·	HADI REZAYI, child of JAN ÌOHAM. NASUMA , born in 1987, detained  since 02/07/2003  One Palestinian child is held in Mytilini reception centre:             ·	HASSAN ALMASRY, child of  ABDELFATAH GAMEILA , born in 1987,  detained since  16/07/2003  Four Afghan children are held in Rhodes reception centre: ·	AMIRI ESMAEEL, born in 1987, detained since 19/08/2003  ·	RAHMANI ABDU AL., born in 1986, detained since 19/08/2003  ·	MAHMADI DAWOOD, born in 1986, detained since 19/08/2003  ·	JAFARI JAVID, born in 1985, detained since 19/08/2003  Two Palestinian children are held in Rhodes reception centre:    ·	AMER MOHAMAD child of DEEB born in 1987, detained since 17/9/2003 ·	AHMED SABRY child of MOHAMAD born in 1985, detained since 17/9/2003  Together with the three previous cases signalled by OMCT (urgent  appeals GRC 120903.CC and GRC 260803.CC), 14 children have been  deprived of their rigth to adequate protection in the last few  months. This amounts to 10% of the overall asylum seekers' population  in reception centres in the two islands. In addition, many more  minors with parents are held together with other adults.   A new police circular reminding its services of international  standards dated 4th July 2003 was distributed to NGOs by UNHCR in  September. But this circular did not refer to the special situation  and rights of unaccompanied children. Hence, the  police as well as  prosecutors remain unaware of the need for a special procedure.  Greek Helsinki Monitor has alerted the police, the Minister of  Justice and the Greek Ombudsman for children. OMCT reiterates its  concern about this situation and urges the goverment of Greece to  urgently inform all concerned services of the relevant procedures to  be followed in cases of unaccompanied minors entering Greece, seeking  asylum or reunification with their families residing in another EU  country.  Action requested  Please write to the authorities in Greece urging them to:  i.	take all necessary measures to immediately guarantee the adequate  reception and protection of the unaccompanied minors seeking asylum ; ii.	engage in a proactive campaign directed at all police and justice  services dealing with asylum seekers informing them of the specific  rights of and procedures for unaccompanied minors to be implemented  in accordance with Greek law and EU regulations ; iii.	guarantee the respect of children's rights throughout the  country in accordance with national laws and international human  rights standards.
