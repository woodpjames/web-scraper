The International Secretariat of OMCT requests your URGENT intervention in the following situation in Israel/Palestine.  New Information  According to further reports received from the Palestinian Society for the Protection of Human Rights and the Environment (LAW), a member of the OMCT network, on October 6 2000, ten Palestinians were killed. These are: 11-year-old Mohammed Jawdat, from Jerusalem who was shot in the head, Majdi Al Maslamani, 14, from Jerusalem; Dia’ Issa, 19, shot in the chest, and Iyad Ishtayeh, 23, shot in the back (both victims are from the village of Abu Salem in the Nablus district); Mohammad Tamam, 21, from Toulkarem, shot in the chest; Lu’ai Al Muqayad, 19, from Gaza, was shot near the Netzarim settlement; Marwan Shamlackh, 23, from Arimal, shot in the heart; Wajed Abu Awwad, 21, from Bani Suhaila, shot in the abdomen; Rashad Anajar, 22, from Al Maghazi, shot in the head; the ninth victim had not been identified yet. Meanwhile, another Palestinian, Saleh Ariyati, 20, died yesterday after sustaining serious head injuries 4 days ago.  The day’s casualties reached a total of 424, of whom 79 were children. 126 were hit with live bullets and 4 with missile fragments. 18 injuries were reported to be critical, 4 very critical. 3 victims are clinically dead   Another Red Crescent ambulance was reportedly fired on by Israeli troops. The driver, Mohammad Al Ja’bari, 34, was hit in the face.   On 7th October 2000, 33 people were reported injured, 3 of whom were reported to be in very critical condition.  In the early morning hours, Mohammad Awad, 23, from Deir Al Hatab in the district of Nablus, died due to injuries he had sustained on 6th October 2000.   Hisham Muqbel, 43, from Gaza, died after being shot with a 12.5 mm bullet at the Netzarim junction. His death raises the death toll to 75.   During the night of 7th and 8th October 2000, under the protection of the Israeli occupying forces, Israeli settlers in the West Bank and Gaza attacked Palestinian villages and residents, killing one Palestinian and wounding many others.   22 year-old Fahed Mustapha Bakker, from the village Bidya near Nablus, was shot and killed by an Israeli settler firing live ammunition from his car. Witnesses reported that an Israeli army jeep accompanied the settler’s car. According to other witnesses, five ambulances were called, one from Nablus, two from Qalkilya and one from Ramallah. The Nablus ambulance was denied passage due to a curfew imposed on the village of Huwara and three came under fire from settlers. When an ambulance finally reached the Bidya, settlers shot at the ambulance and Israeli forces prevented it from entering the area where Bakker and four other Palestinians lay wounded. By the time the ambulance reached Bakker he had bled to death. He was shot in the neck and in the head.   Among other incidents, in Jerusalem, settlers descended on residents of Shufat Refugee Camp, throwing rocks and glass bottles, injuring Hassan Atawil, 20 and several others. Settlers also tried to break into the Orient House in East Jerusalem, but employees and residents prevented them from doing so. Witnesses reported that Israeli Police patrols stood by during this attack. Bands of settlers also blocked El-Zaharh Street in East Jerusalem with rocks, debris and a garbage container and later vandalized some shops there and on El Nusah Street.
