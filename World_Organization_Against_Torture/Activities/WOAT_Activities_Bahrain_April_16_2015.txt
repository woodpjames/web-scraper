Judicial harassment
Bahrain

The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint 
programme of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World 
Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent intervention in the 
following situation in Bahrain.
 
Description of the situation:
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the constant 
judicial harassment of Ms. Ghada Jamsheer, Head of the Women's 
Petition Committee, an organisation which campaigns for the rights and dignity 
of women in the Shari'ah family courts.
 
Since 2005, twelve criminal cases have already been brought against Ms. 
Jamsheer, who is under permanent surveillance with a 24-hour presence of 
plainclothes Public Security officials of the Ministry of the Interior outside 
her home and was banned from national media in 2007.
 
Ms. Jamsheer was arbitrarily detained for more than three months after she 
was arrested on September 14, 2014 on allegations of defamation. This summons 
came in connection with messages posted via her Twitter account criticising 
alleged corruption in the management of King Hamad Hospital in Bahrain, which is 
run by members of the ruling family.
 
While, on October 29, 2014, the Third Criminal Court acquitted Ms. Jamsheer 
and ordered her release on bail regarding this case, she was only released on 
November 27, 2014, to be rearrested 12 hours later on charges of “assaulting a 
police officer”. Ms. Jamsheer was again released on December 15, 2014, and 
further put under house arrest until January 15, 2015. The charges for 
“assaulting a police officer” remained pending and Ms. Jamsheer appeared before 
the Third Criminal Court on April 14, 2015. Next hearing is scheduled on May 5, 
2015.
 
Regarding charges of defamation brought in September 2014 against Ms. 
Jamsheer, the verdict, which was supposed to be given on April 15, 2015, has 
been postponed to June 9, 2015, without providing any reason.
 
Hearings in the pending cases against Ms. Jamsheer are regularly adjourned 
without providing any reason, violating Ms Jamsheer’s right to be tried within a 
reasonable time.
 
Besides, on December 29, 2014, UN experts have urged the government of Bahrain to drop charges 
against Ms. Jamsheer, as she was sentenced “purely for [ 
her]criticism of government authorities. [...] 
Such criticism is not only fully legitimate according to Bahrain’s 
obligations under human rights law; it is also essential to the free and public 
debate necessary for a healthy civil society” they added.
 
Furthermore, on March 14, 2015, Ms. Jamsheer was denied the right to board 
on a plane at Bahrain International Airport by the airport's security office as 
she attempted to travel to France to receive medical treatment. Ms. Jamsheer who 
did not receive any prior notification, was not given any reason for the travel 
ban. Concerning the aforementioned incident, on March 23, 2015, Ms. Jamsheer 
complained to the Public Prosecutor's office regarding the travel ban and was 
informed that she should submit a travel request to the High Criminal Court. The 
Court reviewed her request on April 12, 2015 and decided to waive the travel 
ban, stating that there was no solid reason for such a restriction. Nonetheless, 
on April 15, 2015, the office of the Public Prosecutor was still unable to 
provide Ms. Jamsheer with a formal authorisation to travel, stating that the 
file was now in the hand of the immigration office.
 
The Observatory expresses its deepest concern for the continuous judicial 
harassment of Ms. Ghada Jamsheer, which seems to merely aim at sanctioning her 
human rights activities and calls for the unequivocal lift of her travel ban and 
the end of all harassment against her, as well as against all human rights 
defenders in the country.
