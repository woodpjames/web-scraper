PRESS RELEASE
URUGUAY:
OMCT, IELSUR and the COMMITTEE ON THE RIGHTS OF THE CHILD OF URUGUAY submitted
an alternative report to the UN Committee Against Torture (UNCAT)
Geneva (Switzerland), 29th April
2014.
The World Organisation Against
Torture (OMCT), its member organisation in Uruguay, the Institute for Legal and
Social Studies (IELSUR), and the Committee on the Rights of the Child of
Uruguay presented their joint alternative report on torture and ill-treatment
in Uruguay to the UN Committee Against Torture (UNCAT) during its 52nd
session, in connection with its review of Uruguay’s third periodic report, in
Geneva (Switzerland), from 28th April to 23rd May 2014.

On
the eve of the examination of Uruguay by the Committee Against Torture, the
OMCT has presented additional information to the Committee in a private
meeting, followed by a Skype meeting with the two country rapporteurs and
OMCT’s partner organisations in Uruguay.
The
OMCT has emphasized in its presentation the situation of children deprived of
liberty, presenting to the Committee the conclusions from its last mission in
the country in 2013.  As the sole organisation
present in the meeting, the OMCT could express the grave concerns that civil
society organisations have being denouncing in Uruguay for the past years, such
as the acquiescence of some governmental authorities to the systematic practice
of torture, inhuman and degrading treatment against children in detention
centres.
As
a final recommendation the OMCT urged the Committee to call on Uruguay to
create safeguards for the protection of children deprived of their liberty, and
guarantees that all allegations of
torture are object of a meaningful, diligent, impartial and transparent
investigation in order to ensure accountability and non-repetition.
The
information presented can also be found in the report
submitted by OMCT, jointly with IELSUR and the Committee on the Rights of the
Child of Uruguay (the report is currently
only available in Spanish)[1].
The Committee Against Torture will examine
Uruguay today. To follow the webcast please see http://www.treatybodywebcast.org
