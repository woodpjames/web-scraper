The Observatory for the
Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a partnership of FIDH and the World
Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent intervention in the following
situation in Equatorial Guinea.
 
Description of the situation:
 
The Observatory has been informed by
reliable sources about the arbitrary arrest and detention of Mr. Nsé Ramón
Esono Ebalé (aka Jamón y
Queso), cartoonist and blogger[1]. Mr. Esono Ebalé published
a graphic novel entitled “Obi’s nightmare”[2] in which he depicts
President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo spending a day living as an ordinary
Guinean citizen and suffering the consequences of the regime he himself has
created. The cartoons especially criticise the lack of access to electricity,
healthcare, education and the restriction to freedom of expression in the
country.            
 
According
to the information received, on September 16, 2017, at around 7:00 pm, Mr.
Esono Ebalé and two Spanish nationals were arrested by state security guards
when leaving a restaurant in Malabo. They were taken for questioning at the Office
of Counter-Terrorism and Dangerous Activities at the Malabo Central Police Station.
 
The two
Spanish nationals were released that same day. Mr. Esono Ebalé was questioned
about his drawings of President Obiang, and
about a number of cartoons which the police called defamatory.
 
On
September 19, 2017, the national television announced that Mr. Esono Ebalé had
been arrested and accused by the police of money laundering and currency
counterfeiting, crimes that can carry a 40-year prison sentence.
 
On
September 20, 2017 a judge ordered the provisional detention of Mr. Esono Ebalé
and his transfer to Black Beach prison where he is still being held.
 
The
Observatory denounces the arbitrary arrest and detention of Mr. Esono Ebalé
which are considered to be retaliation for his work defending human rights,
especially freedom of expression.
 
The
Observatory calls on the Equato-Guinean authorities to immediately and
unconditionally release Mr. Esono Ebalé and guarantee his physical and
psychological safety and integrity.
 
Actions requested:
 
Please write to the authorities of Equatorial Guinea urging them to:
i.               
Immediately and unconditionally release Mr. Esono Ebalé and all human rights
defenders arbitrarily detained in Equatorial Guinea;
 
ii.              Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and
psychological integrity of Mr. Esono
Ebalé, as well as all human rights defenders in Equatorial Guinea;
 
iii.             
Put an end to all forms of harassment,
including judicial harassment, against Mr. Esono Ebalé and all human rights
defenders in Equatorial Guinea;
 
iv.            
Comply with the provisions of the United
Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders adopted by the UN General
Assembly on December 9, 1998, in particular Articles 1 and 12.2;
 
v.             
More generally, ensure in all
circumstances the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in
accordance with international human rights standards and instruments ratified
by Equatorial Guinea.
