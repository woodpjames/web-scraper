URGENT APPEAL - THE OBSERVATORY
 
IRN 008 / 0910 / OBS 115.1
Imprisonment / Release
Iran
December 16, 2010
 
The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), has received new information and requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in Iran. 
 
New information:
 
According to the information received, on December 5, 2010, Mr. Emaddedin Baghi, founder of the Centre for the Defence of Prisoners' Rights, laureate of the 2009 Martin Ennals Award for Human Rights Defenders as well as of the 2005 Human Rights Prize of the French Republic, began to serve a one-year prison sentence and a five-year ban from journalism and civil activities (see background information).
 
On November 30, 2010, Emadeddin Baghi had been called by the judiciary to present himself at Evin Prison on December 4 or 5, to begin serving his sentence.
 
The Observatory denounces Mr. Baghi's deprivation of liberty following an unfair trial, as it seems to merely aim at sanctioning his human rights activities, and calls for his immediate and unconditional release.
 
The Observatory was also informed that Ms. Sara (Hajar) Sabaghian and Ms. Maryam Kianersi, who had been arrested on November 13, 2010, were released on December 14.[1] No information could be obtained as to whether charges were brought against them.
 
The Observatory nonetheless deplores that Ms. Nasrin Sotoudeh, prominent human rights lawyer, known for defending juveniles facing death penalty, prisoners of conscience, human rights activists and children victims of abuse, remains arbitrarily detained since September 4, and recently started a new hunger strike. It therefore calls for her immediate and unconditional release.
 
Background information:
 
On December 28, 2009, Mr. Emad Baghi was arrested on charges related to an interview with the late Grand Ayatollah Hussein-Ali Montazeri amid a wave of arrests that hit dozens of human rights defenders. During his detention, he reportedly spent five months out of his six-months in solitary confinement, and has been suffering from heart and breathing problems, as well as of severe back pain.
 
On June 23, 2010, Mr. Emad Baghi was released on health grounds, and following the payment of a bail of about 200,000 dollars.
 
On September 21, 2010, he was summoned by Branch 1057 of the Tehran Revolutionary Court regarding the closure in 2009 of the Centre for the Defence of Prisoners' Rights. He was then informed that on August 17, 2010 he had been sentenced by the Branch 26 of the Revolutionary Court to six years of imprisonment on charges of “propaganda against the system” and “colluding against the security of the regime” in relation to the interview with the late Grand Ayatollah Montazeri.
 
On July 27, Mr. Baghi had also been sentenced by the Branch 15 of the Revolutionary Court to one year of prison and five years of deprivation of civil activities in another case for heading the Centre for the Defence of Prisoners' Rights, and was to serve a total of seven years in prison.
