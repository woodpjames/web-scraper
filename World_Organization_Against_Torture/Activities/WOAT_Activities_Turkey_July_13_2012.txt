TURKEY: 
18 rights and lawyers' groups express concern to the UN as a trial against 46 
lawyers under terrorism charges is due to open on July 16
 
Amsterdam-Ankara-Brussels-Geneva-Grenoble-Montpellier-Ottawa-Paris-Rennes, 
July 13, 2012. 18 
rights and lawyers' groups express concern to the UN Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers and to the UN Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights defenders as a trial under terrorism charges is due to 
open in Istanbul on July 16, 2012.
 
On 
July 16, 2012, a trial against 46 lawyers from the Ağrı, Ardahan, Batman, Bursa, 
Diyarbakır, Denizli, Hakkari, İstanbul, İzmir, Kars, Mersin, Muş, Siirt, Şırnak, 
Urfa, Van Bar Associations, together with one journalist and three staff working 
for a law firm, will open before the İstanbul Heavy 
Penal Court No. 6. 
36 of the lawyers are in pre-trial detention since November 2011. 
 
All 
of them have been involved in the legal representation of Abdullah Öcalan, 
leader of the armed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) and have been accused of 
“passing orders”. They are prosecuted under charges of being “members” or 
“executives” “in an illegal organisation”, namely the alleged terrorist network 
known as the Kurdish Communities Union (KCK) - an organisation considered by the 
authorities to be the “urban branch” of PKK.
 
Similar 
trials are ongoing or pending against other key Kurdish or pro-Kurdish civil 
society actors, including political activists, members of human rights 
non-governmental organisations (NGOs), trade unionists, journalists, 
intellectuals, academics and writers.
 
Yesterday, 
18 rights and lawyers' groups submitted a joint communication to the two UN 
special procedures to request them to closely monitor the situation and 
formulate clear recommendations to the Turkish authorities to ensure respect for 
fair trial standards and, more generally, a safe and conducive environment for 
human rights defenders operating in the country in conformity with their 
international and regional human rights treaty obligations and other 
international standards.
