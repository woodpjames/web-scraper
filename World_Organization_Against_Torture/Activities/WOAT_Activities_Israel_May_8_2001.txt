Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by Palestinian Society for the Protection of Human Rights and the Environment (LAW), a member of the OMCT network, of the arrest and incommunicado detention of Mr. Tarek Awad in Israel.  According to the information received, 26-year old Palestinian Tarek Awad from Ithna, Hebron, was arrested by the Israeli authorities on April 26th 2001, and is being detained incommunicado in Asqalan prison.  According to the information received, Mr. Awad's lawyer Labib Habib, requested a visit to his client, but was informed that a court decision taken on April 30th 2001, during a discussion on whether to extend Mr. Awad's detention, prevented the detainee from receiving visits. Mr. Habib appealed to the Israeli High Court on April 2nd 2001, claiming that the decision to prevent Mr. Awad from receiving visits and access to legal counsel during a hearing concerning the length of his detention was illegal and should be repealed.   Mr. Habib also reportedly demanded that the conditions under which Mr. Awad is currently being detained be improved. Conditions in Asqalan prison are reported to be very poor, especially in the interrogation section, where detainees are reportedly held for long periods of solitary confinement in a cell with cold air being blown inside around the clock, and a red light which is never turned off, leading to headaches and eye-strain.  OMCT is gravely concerned for Mr. Awad's physical and psychological integrity, and notes that his incommunicado detention gives rise to fears that he may be subjected to illegal forms of interrogation.  Action requested  Please write to the authorities in Israel urging them to:  1.	take all necessary measures to guarantee Mr. Awad’s physical and psychological integrity; 2.	guarantee his right to have access to legal assistance; 3.	order his immediate release in the absence of valid legal charges or, if such charges exist, bring him before an impartial and competent tribunal and guarantee his procedural rights at all times; 4.	guarantee an immediate investigation into the circumstances of these events, identify those responsible, bring them before a civil competent and impartial tribunal and apply the penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions provided by law; 5.	guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
