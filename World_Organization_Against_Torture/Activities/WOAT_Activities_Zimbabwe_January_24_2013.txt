Arbitrary detention / Judicial harassment
Zimbabwe
January 24, 2013
 
The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of
the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation
Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent intervention in the following
situation in Zimbabwe. 
 
Description of the situation:
 
The
Observatory has been informed by Zimbabwe Human Rights Association (ZimRights) about
the arbitrary detention and judicial harassment faced by several of its
members, including Mr. Okay Machisa, National Executive Director, Mr. Leo
Chamahwinya, Education Programs Officer, and Ms. Dorcas Shereni,
member and Highfields local chapter Chairperson. 

According to the information received, on January 24, 2013, High Court Judge Justice Felistas Chatukuta postponed to January 25,
2013, the bail hearing for Mr. Okay Machisa detained on charges of “forgery”,
“fraud” and “publishing falsehoods”. On January 21, 2013, the Magistrate Court
further remanded Ms. Dorcas Shereni and Mr. Leo Chamahwinya until February 4,
2013 in relation to similar charges.
 
Mr.
Okay Machisa was arrested on January 14, 2013 at Harare police station along
with ZimRights Secretary Faith Mamutse
on charges of contravening Section 31, 136 and 137 of the Criminal Law
(Codification and Reform) Act for allegedly attempting to defraud the Registrar
General’s Office by forging and manufacturing counterfeit copies of
certificates of voter registration. On the same day, two policemen accompanied
by Mr. Machisa, two lawyers Ms. Mtetwa and Mr. Gift Mtisi, came and searched
the ZimRights' offices. They did not find anything in the offices. No
accessories or materials linked to the Registrar General or Registrar General
of Voters Offices were found at ZimRights. Ms. Mamutse was released after
signing a warned and cautioned statement on the same day. 
 
Ms.
Dorcas Shereni and Mr. Leo Chamahwinya were arrested on December 13, 2012 (See
background information).
 
These arrests occurred just a few weeks after
ZimRights denounced the trend of increasing police brutality across Zimbabwe
and called for urgent action by competent authorities to address these human
rights violations.
 
The
Observatory further recalls that this is not the first time Mr. Machisa has
been harassed by the Zimbabwean authorities. On March 23, 2010, Mr. Machisa was
arbitrarily arrested by a group of twenty officers of the Zimbabwe Republic
Police (ZRP), before being released a few hours later. Similarly, Mr. Leo
Chamahwinya was arrested along with other ZimRights members on April 26, 2010 before
being released[1].
 
The
Observatory expresses its deep concern about the arbitrary detention of Messrs.
Okay Machisa and Leo Chamahwinya and Ms. Dorcas Shereni, which seems to only
aim at sanctioning their human rights activities, and calls upon the
authorities of Zimbabwe to release them immediately and unconditionally.
 
Background information:
 
On
December 13, 2012, members of the Law and Order section of the ZRP visited the
ZimRights offices with the intention of searching the premises. After being
denied access to the building by lawyers representing the organization, the
police left with Mr. Leo Chamahwinya under the guise of getting assistance in
identifying people supposedly defrauding ZimRights. Mr. Chamahwinya, together
with Ms. Dorcas Shereni, were arrested on that day for “forgery”, “conspiracy
to commit fraud” and “publishing falsehoods” prejudicial to the State. Two
other individuals who are neither employees nor members of ZimRights, Messrs.
Farai Bhani and Tatenda Chinaka, were also arrested.
 
On
the same day, the police also called ZimRights' Bulawayo and Mutare regional
Coordinators to report for questioning. The Bulawayo Regional Coordinator
reported to the police on December 17, 2012 and the Bulawayo office was then
subjected to a search with police looking for material prejudicial to the State.
Nothing was discovered or seized and the Regional Coordinator was released with
no charge.
 
On
January 4, 2013, while at the High Court for Mr. Chamahwinya’s bail
application, Mr. Okay Machisa learnt that the Attorney General’s office was
alleging that he, together with Ms. Faith Mamutse, had fled the country to
Norway and were therefore on the run. This was despite the fact that lawyers
representing Mr. Chamahwinya had indicated that Mr. Machisa was actually
present in court and had made several visits to Harare Remand Prison to see Mr.
Chamahwinya. Ms. Beatrice Mtetwa representing ZimRights and Mr. Machisa sent a
letter to the police disputing the allegations of Mr. Machisa and Ms. Mamutse
being on the run. The police called Ms. Mtetwa and advised her to accompany her
clients to the police station, of which this was agreed to be done on January
14, 2013. 
 
On
January 16, the Rottenrow Magistrate Court remanded Mr. Okay Machisa in custody
until January 30. In opposing Mr. Machisa’s bail application, the State Prosecutor
Mr. Michael Reza claimed that Mr. Machisa intended to use the fake registration
slips to discredit the outcome of the next elections and that the subsequent
international outcry would lead to Zimbabwe being declared a no-fly zone by the
United Nations. ZimRights affirms that it has not been engaged in any criminal
activities or such other activities as alleged by the State.
