According to the information received, on 29 September, Mae Tao  Clinic was inspected by Thai authorities. Officials from Mae Sot  District Office and the Immigration Department, who were accompanied  by armed police and intelligence officers, told Dr. Cynthia that she  should prepare for the arrest and deportation of medics and school  teachers who have previously been registered as migrant workers with  the Ministry of Labour.   This warning came after the Thai Government passed a cabinet  resolution in August, prohibiting 12,161 registered migrant workers  from renewing their work permits. As a result, more than 100 medics  and school teachers at Mae Tao Clinic could no longer stay in  Thailand after their work permits expired on 25 September. This may  include Dr. Cynthia herself. Although she has now lived in exile in  Thailand for 15 years, Dr. Cynthia has no official papers and is  effectively stateless.  The Observatory would like to recall that Mae Tao Clinic treats 150  patients a day, delivers 10 to 20 babies a month, trains 30 medics a  year and provides prenatal checkups, childhood immunizations and  education about nutrition, sanitation and family planning. Its five  doctors and 123 other medical staffs treat everything for almost free  of charge. For that, Dr. Cynthia has won numerous international  prizes including a Ramon Magsaysay Award for Community Leadership.  The Observatory is worried about the serious impact this action, if  pursued by Thai authorities, will have on a vital healthcare service  for asylum seekers and migrants on the Thai-Burmese border. The  Observatory also fears for the safety and welfare of those medics and  school teachers if they are deported from Thailand into the hand of  Burmese authorities. Medics and school teachers from Mae Tao Clinic  may be singled out by Burma's ruling State Peace and Development  Council (SPDC), which could possibly lead to severe persecution and  maltreatment including torture and execution.  Action requested :  Please write to the Thai authorities urging them to :  i.	Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological  integrity of Dr. Cynthia Maung and the staff members of Mae Tao  Clinic; ii.	Put an end to the action of the Thai authorities against Dr.  Cynthia Maung and the staff members of Mae Tao Clinic and ensure that  they be allowed to carry out their work without hindrance;  iii.	Ensure the implementation of the provisions on the Declaration  on Human Rights Defenders adopted by the UN general Assembly on  December 9th1998, in particular article 1 which states that "every  person has the right, individually or collectively, to promote the  protection and fulfilment of human rights and fundamental liberties  at the national and international level", as well as its article 12.1  which stipulates that "everyone has the right, individually or in  association with others, to participate in peaceful activities  against violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms";  iv.	Guarantee the respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms in  accordance with the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and other  international instruments ratified by Thailand.
