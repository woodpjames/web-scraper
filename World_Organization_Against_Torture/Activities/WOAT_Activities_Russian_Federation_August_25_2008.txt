Brief description of the situation The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by a reliable source and by Antenna International, a member of OMCT SOS-Torture network, about the arbitrary detention of Mr. Anatoly Ataev (born in 1970) in Krasnodar. According to the information received, Mr. Anatoly Ataev, who was sentenced to 4.5 years prison for fraud and money laundering (Article 159 and 174 of the Russian Federation (RF) Criminal Code), was serving his sentence in pre-trial detention centre n°1 of Krasnodar. On 5 August 2008, Oktyabrsky district court ordered his immediate conditional release. However, Mr. Anatoly Ataev remained detained as the pre-trial detention centre authorities suspended the court decision and requested a confirmation which was later confirmed by the deputy chairman of the court, recalling that the release should be immediate. 20 days later Mr. Anatoly Ataev remains detained. According to the same information, after Mr. Ataev’s lawyers addressed all instances (Prosecutor's Offices, the Investigation Committee under the RF Prosecutor's Office, State Administration of the Federal Penitentiary Service, Human Rights Commissioner, RF President's Administration) but to no avail, Mr. Anatoly Ataev started an hunger strike. The European Court of Human Rights was subsequently seized on 18 August 2008. The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned for the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Anatoly Ataev, in particular with the reported arbitrary detention and risk for his safety and calls for his immediate release. Action requested Please write to the authorities in Russia urging them to:   Guarantee, in all circumstances, the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Anatoly Ataev;  Guarantee immediate and unconditional access to his lawyers and family;  Order his immediate release;  Ensure the respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
