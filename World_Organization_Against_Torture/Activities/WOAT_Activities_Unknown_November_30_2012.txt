Torture
and ill-treatment continue to occur all over the world and these
human rights violations remain too often unpunished. Human
Rights Defenders are the voice of those who are deprived of it
because they are victims of torture, ill- treatment or summary
execution.OMCT
has been supporting their brave fight for several years. From the 1st
to the 10th
of December, the organisation has decided to bring to light the
struggle of these women and men against torture, by illustrating the
challenges and the obstacles they face and the hopes and
disappointments they encounter in their everyday life.We
will introduce you to 10
portraits over 10 days through faces representing five continents. We
invite you to discover the daily work and fight of these human rights
defenders.
