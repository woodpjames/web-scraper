Two years after the attack on the 2010 Rainbow Festival: 
Justice delayed for victims of racist violence and for KISA’s Executive Director Open letter to Cyprus’ Ministry of Justice
23 November 2012

Dear Mr Louka,

Thank you for replying to our delegation’s letter of 6 June 2012, addressed to the
Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Justice, Mr Stelios D. Himonas. This letter was
submitted following the verdict of the Cypriot court acquitting Mr Doros Polycarpou,
KISA’s Executive Director, of all criminal charges brought against him, following the
tragic events at the 2010 Rainbow Festival on 5 November 2010 in Larnaca.

We appreciate your Ministry’s efforts of in keeping us abreast of the actions taken by the
authorities (letter received on 24 October 2012), in particular the administrative
investigation into the two police officers’ testimonies against Mr Polycarpou, who were
found to be unreliable witnesses by the judge.

We also welcome the transposition in Cypriot law of the EU Council Framework Decision
on combating certain forms and expressions of racism and xenophobia by means of
criminal law. We hope that its implementation will help prevent discrimination in
Cyprus, and will ensure that events such as those witnessed at the 2010 Rainbow
Festival will not be repeated in the future.

However, despite these promising developments, and almost six months after the
court’s verdict, we deeply regret that some of our concerns remain unaddressed:

1- In spite of the continuous rise of racism and racist violence in Cyprus over the past
few years, the Ministry has not drawn up any proposals to tackle the rise of the far-right
movement in the country. Cyprus still lacks an action plan to execute and coordinate its efforts in tackling this issue. We request clarifications from the Ministry as to whether
measures have indeed been implemented to address this urgent matter.

2- Your letter refers to investigations into one complaint by Mr Polycarpou, although
three were lodged: one against an undercover police officer who brutalised Mr
Polycarpou; another against the General Secretary of KEA – The Greek Resistance
Movement (one of the organisers of the far-right march which attacked the Rainbow
Festival) for incitement to racial hatred; and, thirdly, one against the police force for
failing to protect the Festival from racist violence. At the time of writing, legal
proceedings against the far-right leader are on-going, however, the “impartial
investigation” bodies for police misconduct mentioned in your letter have so far not
conducted any investigation into the other two complaints due to the on-going Court
proceedings, furthering the sense of impunity which has prevailed since these events
occurred.

3- The delegation welcomes the launch of an administrative investigation regarding the
behaviour of the two police officers who testified in Court and who were found to be
unreliable witnesses. We would like clarifications from the Minister as to whether this
investigation will be carried out by an independent body. We also request a response as
to why no disciplinary action has been taken against these two officers. More
specifically, does the lack of disciplinary action imply that the two police officers, whose
false testimony could have resulted in Mr Polycarpou’s imprisonment for three years,
are considered innocent?

4- We strongly believe that the Court decision entails a clear questioning of the police’s
view that Mr Polycarpou encouraged confrontation with the far-right marchers and
therefore reiterates the need for an independent investigation. Under these
circumstances, our delegation wishes to know if the Minister is willing to re-examine the
possibility of an independent investigation into the police force’s behaviour before,
during and after the racist attacks against the 2010 Rainbow Festival as well as the
failure of the police to protect the Festival participants from being attacked.
Furthermore, we wish to know if any investigation has been launched regarding the
racist crimes committed against individuals, including the Turkish Cypriot who was
stabbed and the Pakistani national who was seriously injured.

5- Finally, it appears that no preventive mechanism has been put in place to ensure that
the rights of migrants, refugees, and human rights defenders are respected. Your letter
only mentions the possibility for victims of racist violence to lodge a complaint. Our
delegation wishes to receive clarifications from the Ministry regarding the authorities’
responsibility to ensure that everyone is free from discrimination and violence. Have
any specific measures been taken by the authorities to guarantee the safety of human
rights defenders and to protect them from political pressure and violence according to
the UN declaration for the protection of Human Rights Defenders?

Two years after the tragic events which occurred at the 2010 Rainbow Festival, our
delegation remains concerned about the effectiveness of the anti-racism and anti-
discrimination policy of the Cypriot authorities.






The police force’s decision not to interfere against the violent anti-migrants and far-right
march on 5 November 2010 and to allow their progression towards, and eventually their
attack on, Festival participants is worrying: it downplays the danger of far-right
movements by treating them “equally” with peaceful supporters of migrant rights. An
effective policy should comprise justice for victims of racist crimes and the end of
impunity for those who participate in their perpetration, directly and indirectly.

We remain hopeful that the Ministry will take these issues seriously and urge the
authorities to:

- Ensure that an external independent investigation establishes who is responsible for
the extreme violence witnessed at the 2010 Rainbow Festival, and that sanctions are
applied in consequence;

- Ensure that an independent external investigation is carried out to establish why the
police force was unable to prevent the attack against the Festival participants and that
disciplinary procedures are taken against the police officers who participated in the
violence;

- Ensure that Mr Polycarpou receives compensation for the unfounded accusations
brought against him and that the two police officers who testified are sanctioned for
providing the court with false and unreliable accounts;

- Commit to the implementation of the above mentioned Council Framework Decision
and to the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, and adopt concrete measures to
monitor and stop the rise of xenophobia and guarantee the protection of minority
groups, migrants, refugees and human rights defenders against racist violence and
discrimination;

- Uphold the rights of all victims of racist crimes and ensure proper compensation for
the persons seriously injured at the 2010 Rainbow Festival;
