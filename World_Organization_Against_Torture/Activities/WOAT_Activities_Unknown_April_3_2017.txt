United against
all forms of torture:
Applying a
cross-cutting perspective to prevent, prohibit and redress torture globally
18th
EU-NGO Human Rights Forum, Brussels, 1-2 December 2016

 
This report aims to capture the discussions and outline
the recommendations from the 2016 EU-NGO Human Rights Forum entitled ‘United
against all forms of torture: Applying a cross-cutting perspective to prevent,
prohibit and redress torture globally’, co-organised by the European External
Action Service (EEAS) and the Brussels-based Human Rights and Democracy Network
(HRDN), which gathers over 50 NGOs operating at the EU
level in the broader areas of human rights, democracy and peace including the
World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT).
The Forum took place at a key moment for global
engagement against torture and ill-treatment. 2016 marked the 10th anniversary
of the entry into force of the Optional Protocol to the Convention against
Torture (OPCAT), the 32nd anniversary of the adoption of the UN Convention
Against Torture (UN CAT) and the 50th anniversary of the adoption of the
International Covenants on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) and on
Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). Addressing torture and ill-treatment
remains as urgent as ever against the backdrop of the global and European
migration crises, counter-terrorism efforts and the shrinking space for
independent civil society, in particular the repression of human rights
defenders (HRDs).
The report summarises the diverse discussions held during
the Forum and includes concrete recommendations for follow up action for the
European Union (EU) and civil society in 2017 and beyond. In presenting the
exchanges at the Forum, all views expressed with regard to the situation within
individual countries are recounted as presented by the participants and do not
reflect the views of individual HRDN members nor the network as a whole.
In line with EU and member state commitments in the
Treaty of Lisbon and the Strategic Framework on Human Rights and Democracy,
HRDN’s vision is that human rights and democracy are placed at the heart of the
EU’s internal and external policy agenda. This vision should manifest itself in
an EU which effectively protects human rights at home and is a force for
positive change in the world. In pursuit of this vision, HRDN aims to influence
EU and EU member states’ foreign and domestic policies and the programming of
their funding instruments to promote democracy, human rights and peace.
The World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) worked
on the preparation of the Forum together with a core group of the HRDN
organisations including the HRDN co-chairs, Amnesty International (AI), the
International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims (IRCT), the
Association for the Prevention of Torture (APT) and the International
Federation of Action by Christians for the Abolition of Torture (FIACAT).
