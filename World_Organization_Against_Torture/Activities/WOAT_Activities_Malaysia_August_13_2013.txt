The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights
Defenders, a joint programme of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT)
and the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), requests your urgent
intervention in the following situation in Malaysia.
 
Brief description of the situation:
 
The Observatory has been informed
by Suara Rakyat
Malaysia (SUARAM)
about the harassment against Ms. Cynthia
Gabriel, SUARAM Secretariat Member, allegedly in
retaliation for SUARAM’s role in exposing a corruption case involving the
Malaysian Government and related to the Scorpene submarine scandal, involving
at least RM 500 million in suspected kickbacks.

According to the information received, on August 7, 2013, at 3 pm, Ms. Cynthia
Gabriel went to IPD Petaling Jaya police station to be investigated under
Section 4(1) of the Sedition Act 1948. The investigation took place after
SUARAM was informed that a police report was lodged against the organisation in
relation to a fundraising dinner it organised on July 19, 2013 in order to
raise funds for the Scorpene case, which is pursued by SUARAM before a French
court.
 
During
the investigation of Ms. Cynthia Gabriel, the Investigating Officer did
not share or detail the content of the police report that was reportedly
brought against SUARAM in regards to the Scorpene dinner. The questions focused
on SUARAM and its work generally, including its policies and positions, and
paralleled the questions that were asked last year when SUARAM faced
investigations from the Company Commission of Malaysia (CCM), the Registrar of
Society (RoS) and the police from July 2012 to March 2013. The intention of
these investigations was also to harass and intimidate SUARAM for its work on
the Scorpene case; the RoS withdrew all pending notices against SUARAM in March
2013[1].
 
The
Observatory condemns the ongoing harassment of SUARAM members and calls on the Malaysian authorities to put an end immediately to the judicial
harassment against Ms. Cynthia Gabriel, all
SUARAM members as well as against all human rights defenders and
organisations operating in the country.
 
Action requested:
 
Please write to the authorities in Malaysia,
urging them to:
 
i. Put an end to any
kind of harassment - including at judicial level - against Ms. Cynthia Gabriel and all members of SUARAM, as
well as against all other human rights defenders in Malaysia, and ensure
in all circumstances that they are able to carry out their legitimate activities
without any hindrance and fear of reprisals;
 
ii. Conform with the provisions of the UN
Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the
United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially:
-       
its
Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in
association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and
realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and
international levels”, as well as
-       
its
Article 12.2, which provides that the State shall “take all necessary measures
to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually
and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de
facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action
as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of his or her rights”; 

iii. Ensure in all circumstances respect for
human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights
standards and international instruments ratified by Malaysia.
