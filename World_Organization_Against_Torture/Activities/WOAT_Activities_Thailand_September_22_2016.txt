The Observatory for the Protection of Human
Rights Defenders, a partnership of FIDH and the World Organisation Against
Torture (OMCT), has received new information and requests
your urgent intervention in the following situation in Thailand.
New information:
The Observatory has been informed by reliable
sources about the sentencing of Mr. Andy Hall, a migrant labour rights
researcher.
According to the information received, on
September 20, 2016, the Bangkok South Criminal Court handed down a four-year
sentence against Mr. Andy Hall and a fine of 200,000 Thai Baht (about 5,160 Euros), on “criminal defamation” and “computer
crimes” charges. The court reduced the sentence to three years, with a two-year
suspended term and a fine of about 150,000 Thai Baht (3,870 Euros).
The case
dates back to February 2013 when the Thai pineapple processing company Natural
Fruit brought charges against Mr. Hall for his contribution to a report
published by Finnish NGO Finnwatch, which alleged serious labour rights abuses
by Natural Fruit (see background information).
Mr. Hall,
who has paid the fine, has indicated that he will appeal the ruling.
This case is
only one of four criminal and civil lawsuits filed by Natural Fruit against Mr.
Hall. Another three cases are still pending.
The Observatory firmly condemns the sentencing
and ongoing judicial harassment against Mr. Andy Hall, as it clearly aims at
sanctioning his legitimate human rights activities, and calls upon the Thai
authorities to immediately and unconditionally drop all charges against him.
Background
information:
Since February 2013, the Thai pineapple
processing company Natural Fruit has filed four criminal and civil lawsuits
against Mr. Hall for defamation and computer crimes in relation to Mr. Hall’s
contribution to a report by the Finnish NGO Finnwatch that alleged serious
labour rights abuses at the company’s factory in Prachuap Khiri Khan Province
and in relation to an interview he gave to Al-Jazeera regarding the same
report[1].
Published in January 2013, the report, Cheap has a high price: Responsibility problems relating to international
private label products and food production in Thailand, gathered worker
interviews in order to document labour rights violations at the factory,
including child labour, underpayment of wages, confiscation of migrant workers’
travel and work documents, and failure to provide legally mandated paid sick
days, holidays, and leave[2].
On October 29, 2014, the Phra Khanong Provincial
Court dismissed the criminal defamation cases related to the Al-Jazeera interview[3],
due to Mr. Hall’s unlawful interrogation process under Article 120 of the
Criminal Procedure Code[4].
However, the Office of
the Attorney General subsequently appealed the court’s dismissal of the case. On September 18, 2015, the
Court of Appeals upheld the Phra Khanong Provincial Court’s dismissal of the
case. In December 2015, Natural Fruit and the Attorney General were given
permission by the Attorney General to appeal to the Supreme Court. In January
2016, the Attorney General and Natural Fruit submitted their appeals on the
case to the Supreme Court. Mr. Hall’s
legal team responded to the appeal, and the appeal decision verdict by the
Supreme Court remains pending. If convicted in this case, Mr. Hall could face
up to one-year imprisonment and a fine (Case 3). 
Natural Fruit filed a 300 million Thai Baht
civil defamation lawsuit against Mr. Hall following the publication of the
Finnwatch report case (Case 2). Negotiations between the two parties failed on
October 30, 2014, following which the Nakhon Pathom Court postponed
consideration of this case until a verdict had been reached in the criminal
defamation and computer crimes case. 
In September 2014, Natural Fruit also filed a
100 million Thai Baht civil defamation lawsuit against Mr. Hall, related to the
Al-Jazeera interview (Case 4). The
first hearing on this case took place on November 21, 2014 at the Phra Khanong
Provincial Court. Mr. Hall submitted his defence, and further hearings followed
in May/November 2015 and January/April 2016. This case was then also postponed
pending a final decision in the appeal to the Supreme Court in the criminal
defamation case related to the interview.
With regard to the criminal case that led to his
conviction on September 20, 2016, the Bangkok South Criminal Court indicted Mr.
Hall on January 18, 2016 under Article 14(1) of the Computer Crimes Act and
Article 328 (libel) of the Criminal Code (Case 1).
Ahead of the indictment, on January 13, 2016,
the Bangkok South Criminal Court confiscated Mr. Hall’s passport and issued a
travel ban against him. The order was handed down following a temporary bail[5]
request submission. Mr. Hall was prohibited from leaving Thailand until the
court ruled on the case, unless permission was granted (permission would have
been granted on a case-by-case basis). On September 20, 2016, the Bangkok South
Criminal Court revoked the order restricting Mr. Hall’s travel and returned his
passport.
