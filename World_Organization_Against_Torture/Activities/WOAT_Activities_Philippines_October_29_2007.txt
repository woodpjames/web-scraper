New information The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Alliance for the Advancement of Peoples’ Rights (KARAPATAN), a member of the SOS-Torture network, that the whereabouts of Ms. Josephine Nogoy, 32 years old, married with little twins, resident of Talaga village, in Tarlac province, Central Luzon, remain unknown more then six months after her abduction by armed men, allegedly military elements, on 27 March 2007. According to the information received, no serious investigation has been undertaken by the relevant authorities to locate Ms. Josephine Nogoy. The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned for the physical and psychological integrity of Ms. Josephine Nogoy, as her whereabouts remain unknown, giving rise to fears that she may be subjected to ill-treatment, torture or potentially extra-judicial execution. OMCT calls on the authorities to immediately locate her whereabouts and guarantee her personal integrity at all times. Reminder of the Situation According to the information received, Ms. Josephine Nogoy was abducted while she was visiting, with her then two-month old twins, her sister-in-law, Ms. Divina Guevarra, at their house in Purok Masagan, Iba village, San Jose town. At around 1:00 am on 27 March 2007, two vans, one colored black, another dark brown or maroon and without license numbers, came to the Guevarra’s house. About 15 armed men wearing black long sleeves, bonnets and gloves and combat shoes, reportedly got out of the vans and divided into two groups. According to the information, one group of eight armed men forcibly entered the Guevarra’s house and threatened all the members of the Guevarra’s family (two adults and two children) at gunpoint. They reportedly searched the rooms and when two of the armed men saw Ms. Josephine Nogoy, they forced her at gunpoint out of the house and into one of the waiting vans outside. The other group of about seven armed men reportedly barged into the neighboring house of the Patricio family allegedly in search of Ms. Josephine Nogoy. The armed men also reportedly threatened the Patricio family at gunpoint.
