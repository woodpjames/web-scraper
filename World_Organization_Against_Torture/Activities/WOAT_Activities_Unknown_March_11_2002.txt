What dangers are they faced with on a daily basis in more than 80 countries? What means are implemented in an attempt to neutralise their action? How can we support their struggle while ensuring their protection?  Since 1997, the Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint program of FIDH and OMCT, offers daily support to those who take risks on the ground to bring aid to the victims of human rights violations and to defend fundamental freedoms.  In its 2001 annual report, the Observatory gives the floor to trade-union leaders, journalists, members of families of disappeared persons, lawyers, judges, enviromentalists, defenders of indigenous peoples and of sexual minorities. The diversity of their actions is part of a common battle in favour of the respect and enjoyment of the entirety of human rights for all.  This report, which presents the cases of more than 400 defenders, who are victims of unacceptable violations, shows that in 2001 the situation of the activists has continued to worsen.  This publication, edited by Mango Document, will soon be available in bookshops.  To read this report, click here:       Executive         Summary  Part I   Part         II
