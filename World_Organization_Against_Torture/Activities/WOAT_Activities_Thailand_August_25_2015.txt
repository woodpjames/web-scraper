Judicial harassment
Thailand
August 25, 2015
The Observatory for the Protection of Human
Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the International Federation for Human
Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) has received
new information and requests your urgent intervention
in the following situation in Thailand.
New information:
The Observatory has been informed by reliable
sources about the ongoing judicial harassment of Mr. Andy Hall, a
migrant labour rights researcher.
According to the information received, on August
24, 2015, Bangkok South Criminal Court indicted Mr. Hall under Article 14(1) of
the Computer Crimes Act and Article 328 of the Thai Criminal Code in a case
filed by the Thai pineapple processing company Natural Fruit. The conviction
carries a maximum penalty of seven years’ imprisonment. Following this
decision, Mr. Hall is expected to be summoned to appear in court. He will then
be detained while awaiting trial and will have an opportunity to seek release
on bail.
The complaint stems from Mr. Hall’s contribution
to a report published in 2013 by the Finnish NGO Finnwatch that alleged serious
labour rights abuses at the Natural Fruit company’s factory in Prachuap Khiri
Khan Province. Mr. Hall is facing other criminal and civil lawsuits following
similar complaints by Natural Fruit. (see background information).
The Observatory firmly condemns the ongoing
judicial harassment against Mr. Hall as it clearly aims at sanctioning his
legitimate human rights activities.
The Observatory calls upon the Thai authorities
to immediately and unconditionally drop all charges against him.
Background
information:
Since February 2013, Natural Fruit has filed
four criminal and civil lawsuits against Mr. Hall for defamation and computer
crimes in relation to Mr. Hall’s contribution to a report by the Finnish NGO
Finnwatch that alleged serious labour rights abuses at the company’s factory in
Prachuap Khiri Khan Province. Published in 2013, the report, Cheap has a
high price: Responsibility problems relating to international private label products
and food production in Thailand, gathered worker interviews in order to document
labour rights violations at the factory, including child labour, underpayment
of wages, confiscation of migrant workers’ travel and work documents, and
failure to provide legally mandated paid sick days, holidays and leave[1].
The criminal charges carry a maximum of seven
years in prison and a fine of about 10.3 million Euro in damages. Phra Khanong Provincial Court dismissed the first criminal
defamation case on October 29, 2014, due to Mr. Hall’s unlawful interrogation
process under Section 120 of the Criminal Procedure Code[2].
However, the Attorney
General Office subsequently appealed the court’s dismissal of the case and a
decision on the appeal is expected for September 25, 2015.
Actions requested:
Please write
to the Thai authorities asking them to:
i.       Drop
all charges against Mr. Andy Hall and put an end to all acts of judicial
harassment against him and all human rights defenders in Thailand;
ii.     
Guarantee in all circumstances the
physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Andy Hall, as well as that of all human rights defenders
in Thailand;
iii.     Conform
with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by

discuss, form and hold opinions on the observance, both in law and in practice,

            - Article 12.2, which
provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the
protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in
association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto
or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a
consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the
present Declaration”;
