New information The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by a reliable source and Antenna International, member organisation of the OMCT SOS-Torture Network, about the sentencing by a special court held inside Insein Prison Compound, on 30 October 2008, of Mr. Zaw Zaw Min (aka Bound Bound), member of the 88 Generation Students group[1] and former political prisonner, to two years imprisonment with hard labour under Section 505 (B)[2] of the Penal Code. He was reportedly accused of contacting foreign media and relaying false information which undermined the government. According to the information received, Mr. Zaw Zaw Min has been detained since his arrest in December 2007 at Insein Prison. He was presented before the court in August 2008. Mr. Zaw Zaw Min was reportedly subjected to torture during interrogation. According to the same information, Mrs. Khin Moe Aye and Mr. Kyaw Soe, also members of the 88 Generation Students group[3] and former political prisoners, were sentenced to three-year imprisonment with hard labour on 17 October 2008 by Rangoon’s Insein prison court. They were reportedly accused of illegally handling foreign currency.  Both were reportedly transferred to remote prisons on 24 October 2008. Mrs. Khin Moe Aye was transferred to Myingyan Prison in Mandalay Division and Mr. Kyaw Soe was transferred to Thayet Prison in Magway Division The International Secretariat of OMCT expresses its deep concern about the sentencing of Mrs. Khin Moe Aye, Mr. Kyaw Soe and Mr. Zaw Min, who seemed to have been arrested solely for their rights to freedom of expression and peaceful political opposition during the protests in August and September 2007[4]. OMCT is further very much concerned with regard to the torture suffered by Mr. Zaw Zaw Min and the conditions of detention of all three. OMCT wishes to recall that the prohibition of torture is a peremptory norm, that torture can never be justified under any circumstances. It further calls on the authorities to comply with the UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners. Reminder of the situation The International Secretariat of OMCT was informed about the arbitrary arrest of Mrs. Khin Moe Aye, Mr. Kyaw Soe and Mr. Zaw Min (aka Bound Bound), all three members of the 88 Generation Students group[5] and former political prisoners, by the Burmese military junta on 18 December 2007. Mrs. Khin Moe Aye and Mr. Kyaw Soe were reportedly arrested at Pegu (Bago), 50 miles North of Rangoon, while Mr. Zaw Min was arrested in Rangoon, at his hiding place. According to the information received, Mrs. Khin Moe Aye actively participated in the 1988 popular uprising as a student leader of the Rangoon University Student Union (RUSU) and member of the All Burma Federation of Student Unions (ABFSU). She was reportedly already arrested in December 1991 for her leading role in the student protest, honoring Daw Aung San Suu Kyi for receiving the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize. She was sentenced to ten-year imprisonment and released in 1992 under an amnesty. She continued her activities for democracy, human rights and assisting political prisoners and was arrested again in February 1998. She was sentenced to seven-year imprisonment and released in 2004. According to the same information, Mr. Kyaw Soe was a student leader in the 1988 popular uprising. He was reportedly already arrested in March 1991 for his leading role to convene the second anniversary of the death of Phone Maw, who was the first student killed by the regime in 1988. He was sentenced to three-year imprisonment and released in 1993. Mr. Zaw Min was a third year University student, student activist and member of the All Burma Federation of Student Unions (ABFSU) in 1988. He was reportedly arrested on 2 August 1991 and sentenced to twelve-year imprisonment. His sentenced was reportedly increased another seven years in prison for his attempt to smuggle out a letter to the former United Nations Commission on Human Rights, alerting about the situation inside the prison. He was then released in April 2007 from Thayet Prison. On 22 August 2007, he was again arrested together with the leaders of the 88 Generation Students group[6], including Min Ko Naing and Ko Ko Gyi. He was reportedly released on 1 November 2007. As of issuing this appeal, the whereabouts of the three individuals remain unknown.
