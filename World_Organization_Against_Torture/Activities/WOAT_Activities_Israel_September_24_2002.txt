New information The International Secretariat has been informed by reliable sources that the conditions for the women prisoners in Neve Tirza (at present there are 12 women) are deteriorating. Lawyer Fuad Sultani from the "Association for the Welfare of the Prisoner" visited the Palestinian women prisoners on 28 January 2002, and the Women’s Organization for Political Prisoners (WOFPP) lawyer, Allegra Pacheco, visited them on 31 January 2002, and both report the following: After the last suicide bombing in Jerusalem, the criminal prisoners in Neve Tirza screamed death threats at the political prisoners and threw glasses into their cells. About 30 riot police, men and women, sprayed the cells of the political prisoners with tear gas, even though there are strict directives prohibiting spraying tear gas inside a closed space. Some of the women fainted. The police entered the cells of the Palestinian women and started beating them with their truncheons.  Amne Muna was subjected to the worst beating; her mouth and eyes were forcibly held open by two wardens, while tear gas was sprayed on her face. Both lawyers have seen the burns on her face. She also told the lawyers that an officer threatened her with murder. Amne was later told by the prison authorities that she had not been punished for any personal wrongdoing, but because she is the representative of the women. All the women were put in isolation and were handcuffed for some hours. Their electrical items such as heaters, radios, kettles and TV sets were confiscated; they are not allowed to shop in the canteen for one month; the only two prisoners who are still being granted family visits at all (they are from Jerusalem), will not be allowed to see their families for two months. Brief reminder of the situation  The international secretariat was informed that on 13 September, the prison wardens entered the cells of the Palestinian women prisoners, took away their possessions and took Maha Al-A’ak (22), Abeer Amer (21), Suad Ghazal (18), Wijdan Buji (22), and Rab’a Hamael (14) to isolation cells. They then removed Amne Muna (25) to an entirely different section, where there are only criminal prisoners. The women were fearful for Amne Muna’s safety and started screaming her name. Later that evening, male and female police and wardens entered their isolation cells and started beating them.   According to the information, the police and wardens tied their spread arms and legs to their beds with plastic restraints that were tight to the point of causing swelling and severe pain. The wardens covered Wijdan and Suad’s faces with their veils while they were chained to the bed, causing them difficulties breathing. After 2 hours, the wardens came back to the isolation cells and loosened the restraints, but left them chained to their beds in this humiliating position for the night.   A lawyer who visited the prison on 16 September 2001, reported that the women were still in isolation on that day and that they had wounds and bruises on their faces and bodies. During her visit, the prison warden refused to take the shackles off Amne Muna’s legs. There was no water in her cell, and at the time of the visit, at 13h45, she still had not received any water that day. One finger on her right hand was swollen, badly bruised and bloody.  OMCT fears for all the female prisoners’ physical and psychological integrity in the Neve Tirtza prison. OMCT is also very concerned about the generally bad conditions for Palestinian female prisons in this prison.
