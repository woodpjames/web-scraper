SYRIA:
Finally free, Mazen Darwish must now be acquitted
Paris-Geneva,
August 10, 2015 – The release today of prominent human rights defender
Mazen Darwish, after three years and a half of detention, is a great relief,
said the Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders. Despite his
release, Mazen Darwish, like his colleagues Hussein Ghrer and Hani al-Zaitani,
has been charged with “publicising terrorist acts” and is being tried before
the Syrian Anti-Terrorism Court. Our organisation calls for all charges against
them to be dropped. The verdict hearing is expected on August 31, 2015.
“Mazen,
Hussein and Hani are not terrorists, they are human rights defenders,”
FIDH President Karim Lahidji said today. “All charges against them must
be dropped immediately”, he added.
Since they
were arrested on February 16, 2012, the three human rights defenders have been
held in conditions amounting to enforced disappearance and subjected to acts of
torture on several occasions. Most recently, their whereabouts have been
unknown for a period of almost two months between May 3 and June 30, 2015[1].
“We urge the Syrian Anti-Terrorism
Court to acquit them during the verdict hearing on August 31, as their judicial
harassment has only been aimed at sanctioning their human rights activities”,
OMCT Secretary General Gerald Staberock concluded.
Mazen Darwish,
Director of the Syrian Centre for Media and Freedom of Expression (SCM), an
FIDH member-organisation, had been listed in an amnesty decree granted on the
occasion of Eid al-Fitr, together with his colleagues Hussein Ghrer and Hani
al-Zaitani. These latter were released respectively on July 17 and 18, 2015[2].
On May 15, 2013, in its Resolution
67/262, the UN General
Assembly called for the release of the three defenders. In January 2014, the UN Working
Group on Arbitrary Detention also
found that the three defenders had been arbitrarily deprived of their liberty
due to their human rights activities and called for their immediate release.
Finally, UN Security
Council Resolution 2139, adopted
on February 22, 2014, also demanded the release of all arbitrarily detained
people in Syria.
The Observatory has been calling on Syrian authorities to release Mazen,
Hussein and Hani since their arrest on February 16, 2012. It its is only a year
later that they were charged before an investigating judge of the
Anti-Terrorism Court, referring explicitly to Mazen Darwish's work to promote
and protect human rights to indict them.
The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders (OBS) was created in
1997 by FIDH
and the World
Organisation Against Torture (OMCT). The objective of this
programme is to intervene to prevent or remedy to situations of repression
against human rights defenders.
