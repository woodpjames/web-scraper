No circumstances can ever justify torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and such acts must be made criminal offences in national law. States are responsible before the international community for outlawing torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, for preventing their occurrence, for prosecuting and punishing those guilty of such acts and for providing reparation to the victims; Strongly deplore the open practice and justification by certain States of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and the open or silent cooperation and complicity of other States in those practices that gravely undermine our daily work and provide justification to repressive regimes that practice torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; Further, express our deepest concern at attempts by certain public figures, jurists, academics and others to undermine the absolute prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and the complicity of some media in justifying such unlawful treatment; Emphasising that in our daily work of defending human rights and human dignity, we are witness to the devastating physical and psychological consequences that torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment inflict on the victims, such as women, men, children, youth, the poor and marginalised, indigenous peoples, minorities and others, on their family members and on society as a whole, in addition to the dehumanising effects upon those who practice torture and other forms of ill-treatment; Welcome the conclusions of 29 April 2008 of the Council of the European Union in which it recalled "the EU's firm position to fully comply with obligations in respect of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, in the fight against terrorism, in particular the absolute prohibition of torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment"; Call on all States to make similar statements categorically rejecting torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; Call, in particular, on African Governments to end torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and to make Africa a continent free from such practices, to end impunity by identifying, prosecuting and punishing those guilty, directly or indirectly, of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and to ensure justice, reparation, assistance and rehabilitation to victims of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; Recognise the essential role of civil society organizations in effectively ending torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and in efforts to ensure justice, reparation, assistance and rehabilitation for the victims; Call for strengthening of the civil society organizations fighting torture and other forms of ill-treatment and increased cooperation with them on the part of national authorities in the fight against torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; Encourage the African Union, the European Union and the United Nations to take practical steps to strengthen their cooperation and activities against torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, in particular within the framework of the Guidelines to EU policy towards third countries on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and to strengthen their cooperation and support for civil society organisations engaged in the promotion and protection of human rights; Request all interested organisations to join with the World Organisation Against Torture in adhering to this Declaration and in circulating it widely, and invite organisations and individuals to transmit this Declaration to all African Governments, the African Union, the European Union, the United Nations and other relevant institutions.    Action by Christians for the      Abolition of Torture (ACAT), Burundi Action by Christians for the      Abolition of Torture (ACAT), Central African Republic Action by Christians for the      Abolition of Torture (ACAT), Togo  Association pour les Droits de      l’Homme et l’Univers Carcéral (ADHUC), Republic of the Congo Centre for Security and      Development Studies (CSDS), Liberia  CLEEN Foundation, Nigeria Comité des Observateurs des Droits de l'Homme (CODHO), Democratic Republic of the Congo Comité de Réflexion et d’Orientation      Indépendant pour la Sauvegarde des Acquis Démocratiques (CROISADE),      Niger  Defence for Children      International (DCI), Ghana  Enfants Solidaires d’Afrique et      du Monde (ESAM), Benin Independent Medico-Legal Unit      (IMLU), Kenya  International Commission of      Jurists (ICJ), Kenya  Land Centre for Human Rights      (LCHR), Egypt Mouvement pour la Défense des Droits de l'Homme et des Libertés      (MDDHL), Cameroon Rencontre Africaine pour la Défense des Droits de l’Homme (RADDHO), Senegal Women in Law and Development in      Africa (WiLDAF), Zambia World Organisation Against      Torture (OMCT), Switzerland Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human      Rights (ZLHR), Zimbabwe    Maputo, Mozambique 11 May 2008     In addition, the following organisations and individuals adhere to and express their support for the message and principles contained in the Maputo Declaration:    Action      pour la protection des personnes vulnérables en Afrique, Democratic      Republic of Congo   African Centre for Treatment and Rehabilitation      of Torture Victims (ACTV), Uganda  Les Amis de Martin Luther King,      Democratic Republic of Congo  Amis des      Victimes des Violations des Droits Humains (AVVDH), Democratic Republic of      Congo Antenna      International, Switzerland  Association      d’aide et de protection des groupes vulnérables du Centre Nord (APVCN),      Burkina Faso   L’Association      de Défense des Droits de l’Homme au Maroc (ASDHOM), France Bulgarian      Helsinki Committee, Bulgaria Centre      Action Social Réhabilitation et Réadaptation pour la Victime de la Torture      (SOHRAM-CASRA), Turkey Centre for Human Rights, Democracy      and Transitional Justice Studies, Democratic Republic of Congo Centre for Minority Rights      Development (CEMIRIDE), Kenya  Centre for the Study of Violence and      Reconciliation (CSVR), South Africa Centro      de Atencion Psicosocial (CAPS), Peru  Civil      Society Prison Reform Initiative (CSPRI), South Africa Conferencia Nacional de Organizaciones      Afrocolombiana (CNOAY), Colombia Corporación Centro de Pastoral Afrocolombiana      (CEPAC)  European Association for the Defence      of Human Rights (AEPADO), Romania Groupe      Justice et Libération (GJL), Democratic Republic of Congo Khulumani Support Group, South Africa Jananeethi      Institute, India Justiça Global, Brazil  Justice and Peace Commission, Mexico La Ligue      Camerounaise des Droits Humains, Cameroon Movement for the Survival of the      Ogoni People (MOSOP), Nigeria Nora Wilson, Toronto, Canada Organização      de Dereitos Humanos – Projeto Legal, Brazil ‘Dejo Olowu, Professor of Law, Walter      Sisulu University, South Africa Philippine      Alliance of Human Rights Advocates (PAHRA),      Philippines Programme      d'appui pour le développement de la femme et de l'enfant du Congo      (PADEFECO), Democratic Republic of Congo  Rencontre      pour la Paix et les Droits de l’Homme (RPDH), Republic of Congo –      Brazzaville South Africa No Torture Consortium      (SANTOC).
