programme of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and 
the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent 
intervention in the following situation in Burma / Myanmar.Description of the situation:The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the killing of Mr. Johnny,
 a land and farmers’ rights defender and Chairman of the National League
 for Democracy (NLD) in Kawthinshu Village, Hpa-an Township, Karen 
State. Mr. Johnny helped locals in several land grabbing cases and was a
 known land rights advocate.According to the

morning, Mr. Johnny was shot dead by unknown assailants in front of his 
house in Eindea Village, Hpa-an Township. Mr. Johnny’s 14-year-old 
daughter heard shots and found Mr. Johnny still breathing before he 
passed away a few moments later. The police were informed of the 
shooting at approximately 1:50am and went to inspect the scene. They 
found Mr. Saw Johnny’s body about three meters away from the entrance of
 his home with eight bullet holes in his back and leg. Ten bullet 
casings were also found at the scene. The case is currently under police
