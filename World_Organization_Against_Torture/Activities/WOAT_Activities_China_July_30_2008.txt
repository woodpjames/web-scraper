Brief description of the situation The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by The Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy (TCHRD), member of OMCT SOS-Torture network, about the arbitrary arrest and detention of four Tibetans from Nangchen County, Jyekundo "Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture" ('TAP') in Qinghai Province, namely Mr. Asang Bersatsang (21 years old), Mr. Ngoesoe Konkyaptsang, (35 years old), Jamsang and Gadho (age unknown) on 26 July 2008. According to the information received, the four Tibetans were arrested by the Chinese Public Security Bureau (PSB) officials from Drokshog Township by Nangchen and detained at Nangchen County PSB Detention Centre, after having protested against the Summer Festival planned by the Chinese government to greet the upcoming 2008 Beijing Olympic Games[1]. At the time of issuing the appeal, there is no information on the current condition of the four arrested individuals. According to the same information, on 26 July 2008, just three days before the actual commencement of the Summer festival, Asang Bersatsang, Ngoesoe Konkyaptsang, Jamsang and Gadho reportedly voiced their disapproval of the summer festival to greet the Olympic Games in the presence of a large number of local government officials and people at the site of the planned festival in Drokshog Township. They reportedly said "this is not the year to celebrate as Tibetans have suffered untold repression under the Chinese regime, rather it is time to mourn and offer prayers (for those died and imprisoned in recent protests across Tibet)," "we want freedom" and "the Dalai Lama should return to Tibet". After their protest, while distributing pamphlets, the four reportedly requested Tibetans at the festival site to return to their respective villages.  The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned for the safety of the four above mentioned individuals, whose conditions of detention are currently unknown and who, according to the information received, were arrested and detained solely for their rights to freedom of expression, association and assembly. OMCT fears that they may be subject to torture and ill-treatment. OMCT recalls that China is a State party to the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment which prohibits torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. OMCT urges the authorities to conform with China’s international human rights obligations, commitments that were reaffirmed on the occasion of its election as a member of the new United Nations Human Rights Council. Actions Requested Please write to the authorities in the People’s Republic of China urging them to:   Guarantee, in all circumstances, the physical and psychological integrity of Asang Bersatsang, Ngoesoe Konkyaptsang, Jamsang and Gadho;  Guarantee immediate and unconditional access to legal representation, their families and any medical treatment they may require;  Order their immediate release in the absence of valid legal charges, or, if such charges exist, bring them before an impartial, independent, competent and fair tribunal and guarantee their procedural rights at all times;  Order a thorough and impartial investigation into these events in order to identify all those responsible, bring them to trial and apply the penal and/or administrative sanctions as provided by law;  Guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
