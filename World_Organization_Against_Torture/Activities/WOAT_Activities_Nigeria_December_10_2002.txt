Brief description of the situation :  The Observatory has received with deep concern information related to acts of harassment carried out by members of the State Security Services against human rights defenders in Nigeria.   On December 3, 2002, Mr. Tajudeen Abduraman, a member of Centre for Democracy and Development (CDD) was arrested at the Murtala Muhammed Airport (Lagos) on his way out of the country to London. His travel passport was confiscated and he was reportedly ill-treated and manhandled.  He was later released, but his passport has not been yet returned to him.   On December 6, 2002, Ms. Iheoma Obibi, the Executive Director of Alliances for Africa, a regional human rights and development organisation, was arrested by State Security Services  at the Murtala Muhammed Airport on his way out of the country to London. Although she was released that day, her passport has not been yet returned to her.  On December 6, 2002, officials of State Security Services raided the offices of Women Aids Collective, a women rights NGO in Enugu, seeking to arrest the Executive Director to the organisation, Mrs. Joy Ezeilo, who was absent when this facts occurred. They left with a message that they will come back to get her in the near future.  The Observatory recalls that 200 copies of a report published by OMCT and Nigerian NGO the Centre for Law Enforcement Education (CLEEN), entitled “Hope betrayed? A report on Impunity and State-Sponsored Violence in Nigeria,” based on the input of some 60 local NGOs, have been seized on October 14, 2002 by the customs office in Lagos. Furthermore, a researcher, Idris Bawa of the National Human Rights Commission and two persons who collaborated in drafting the report, Ms. Isioma Ojugbana and Ms. Ijeoma Nwachukwu, both members of the Civil Liberties Organisation (CLO) in Lagos have been subjected to harassment by Security Services agents.   This wave of arrests against human rights defenders has been denounced by various Nigerian Human Rights Groups among those Legal Resources Consortium (LRC), Centre for Law Enforcement Education (CLEEN), Project Alert, Media Rights Agenda (MRA) and Legal Defence And Assistance Project (LEDAP). All have expressed their preoccupation concerning the recurrent use of threats and intimidation against members of the civil society.  The Observatory expresses its support to the Nigerian Human Rights associations and condemns this climate of hostility against human rights defenders aimed at dissuading them to carry out their human rights activities and their fight against impunity.
