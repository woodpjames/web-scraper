The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a partnership
of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and the FIDH, has received new
information and requests your urgent intervention in the following situation
in Egypt.
New information:
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the travel ban
issued against Mr. Negad El-Borai, human rights lawyer and
Director of the “United Group – Attorneys-at-law, Legal
Advisors” (United Group)[1].
According to the information received, on January 26, 2017, the airport authorities prevented Mr. Negad El-Borai
from boarding his flight to Jordan at Cairo International Airport, pursuant to a travel ban issued by an investigating magistrate and the
General Prosecutor within the framework of a criminal investigation under case
No. 173/2011, known as the “foreign funding case against NGOs”. 
The Observatory
strongly condemns the increasing use of travel bans against defenders in Egypt
in the past few months[2], which clearly aim at
restricting their legitimate human rights activities. 
The Observatory would like to recall that Mr. Negad El-Borai is also the
subject of another criminal investigation, together with Judge Hesham Raouf
and Judge Assem Abdel Gabar, for drafting and submitting to the
President an abill to combat torture (see background information).
The Observatory urges the Egyptian authorities to immediately
and unconditionally lift the travel ban against Mr. Negad El-Borai and
put an end to all acts of harassment against him as well as against all other
human rights defenders in the country.
Background Information:
In March 2015, the High Judicial Council filed a complaint against Mr.
Negad El-Borai for drafting an anti-torture bill, organising a workshop to
discuss it, and advocating before the Egyptian authorities for its adoption.
On May
21, 2015, Mr. Negad El-Borai was interrogated by an
investigative judge in North Giza Court for drafting an anti-torture bill.
On March 3, 2016,
Mr. El-Borai was interrogated for the fourth time by an investigative judge for
drafting an anti-torture bill. Subsequently, he was arrested, then released from custody on his
guarantee of residence, and charged with “establishing an unlicensed entity
with the intent of inciting resistancewards to the authorities”, “implementing
human rights activities without a license”, “deliberately spreading false
information with the purpose of harming public order or public interest” and
“receiving funds from the National Center for State Courts (NCSC)”.
On April 6, 2016,
United Group submitted its draft anti-torture bill to the House of
Representatives’ Speaker, calling for its adoption.
On May 17, 2016, Mr.
Negad El-Borai was summoned for the fifth time before an investigative judge. 
On June 5, 2016,
Mr. El-Borai was again called for an investigation session, during which the investigative
judge confronted his testimony with the statement made by the National Security
officer. The officer stated that Mr. El-Borai had “received funds from
foreign organisations to bring down the State and attract youth to establish
political movements in order to turn public opinion against the State using
methods of “non-violence”. He added that Mr. El-Borai “gives statements
to the media that turn public opinion against the State inside and outside the
country using the indirect methods of the “minds revolution” that causes
its fall.
Moreover, Judge Hesham Raouf, who sits at Cairo’s Appeal Court
and former Justice Minister’s assistant, and Judge Assem
Abdel Gabar, have also been targeted for participating in the drafting of the
Anti-Torture Bill. On November 12, 2016, Judge Abdulshafy Othman summoned Judge
Hesham Raouf for an interrogation regarding the drafting of the Anti-Torture Bill.
Actions requested:
Please write to the authorities of Egypt asking them to:
i. Immediately and unconditionally lift the
travel ban against Mr. Negad El-Borai;
ii. Put an end to all forms of harassment - including at the judicial level
- against Judge Hesham Raouf, Negad El-Borai, and Judge Assem Abdel Gabar
and in general against all human rights defenders in Egypt, when they only aim
at sanctioning their legitimate human rights activities;
iii. Comply with all the provisions of the United Nations Declaration on
Human Rights Defenders, in particular with its Articles 1, 5(b) and 12.2;
iv. Ensure in all
circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance
with international human rights standards and international instruments
ratified by Egypt.
