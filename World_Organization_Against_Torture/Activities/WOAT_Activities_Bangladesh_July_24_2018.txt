When Mr. Rahman tried to get into his car, the men hurled broken pieces of bricks,targeting his carandbreaking its windows, which forcedhim to take shelter inthe offices of an advocate. The BCL men then entered the room and beat Mr. Rahman, leaving him with injuries to the head and face. The police arrived only after most of the attackers left and Mr. Rahman was subsequently taken on a flight out of Kushtia and then brought by ambulance to a hospital in Dhaka, where doctors reported injuries to his face, back of the head and right shoulder, including a laceration on the right lower eyelid and a 2-3 cm long deep laceration behind the right ear. He remains in hospitalat the time of publication of this Urgent Appeal. The Observatory strongly condemns the attack against Mr. Mahmudur Rahman and urges the Government of Bangladesh to guarantee, in all circumstances, his physical and psychological integrity as well as to carry out an immediate, thorough, impartial, and transparent investigation into the events described above, in order to identify all those responsible and hold them accountable. Background information[1] The Observatory recalls that Mr. Mahmudur Rahman was previously arbitrary detained for 1,322 days, before being released on bail on November 24, 2016. Upon his release, he was directly transferred to United Hospital in Dhaka for medical assessment and treatment, as his health had severely deteriorated during his prolonged arbitrary detention due to ill treatment and lack of access to proper medical care. Despite his release on bail, Mr. Rahman is still facing prosecution under at least 80 different criminal cases. These cases are widely regarded to be fabricated and politically motivated, in several instances accusing Mr. Rahman of involvement in crimes that took place while he was already under police custody. Actions requested:  Please write to the authorities in Bangladesh, urging them to: i. Guarantee, in all circumstances, the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Mahmudur Rahman as well as of all human rights defenders in Bangladesh; ii. Carry out an immediate, thorough, impartial, and transparent investigation into the attack against Mr. Mahmudur Rahmanin order to identify all those responsible and hold them accountable; iii. Put an end to all forms of harassment - including at the judicial level - against Mr. Mahmudur Rahman, as well as all human rights defenders in Bangladesh, and ensure in all circumstances that they are able to carry out their legitimate activities without any hindrance and fear of reprisals; iv. Conform to the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its Articles 1 and 12.2; v. Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by Bangladesh. Addresses: ·   Ms. Sheikh Hasina, Prime Minister of Bangladesh. Fax: +880 2 8113243, Email: pm@pmo.gov.bd·   Professor Dr. Gowher Rizvi, Adviser to the Prime Minister (International Affairs), Bangladesh. Fax: +880 2 9111312 Email: advinternational@pmo.gov.bd·   Mr. Asaduzzaman Khan, State Minister for Home Affairs of Bangladesh.
