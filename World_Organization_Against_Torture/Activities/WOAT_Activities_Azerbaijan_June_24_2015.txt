statement delivered by the
World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT)
and the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), within the framework
of the Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders.
 
Mr.
President, 
OMCT and FIDH have been documenting a truly
unprecedented crackdown against civil society in AZERBAIJAN.The repression has particularly escalated over
the past year, as the date of the Baku European Games approached[1]. The
result is the arbitrary arrest and detention on trumped-up charges of almost
all prominent human rights defenders and journalists, notably: Leyla Yunus,
member of OMCT General Assembly, Arif Yusunov, Intigam Aliyev, Rasul
Jafarov, Khadija Ismayilova, Hilal Mammadov, Anar Mammadli and Rauf
Mirqadirov. This occurs in a context of new laws restricting freedom of
association, the freezing of bank accounts of major independent human rights
groups. Today any credible and independent human rights work by civil society
has become impossible.A paradigmatic example is that defenders such as our
colleagues Leyla Yunus and Intigam Aliyev remain imprisoned despite their
deteriorating health condition due to the refusal of Azerbaijan to at least
release them on humanitarian grounds.It is important to highlight that the repression seems
to be a strategy closely linked with the celebration of the Games in Baku in
order to prevent criticism from spoiling the event as it happened with the
Eurovision contest.The Observatory welcomes the steps forward taken by
some major political and sports stakeholders from various States and
international organisations such as the Council of Europe, the OSCE, the UN,
the European Parliament, the German Olympic Sports Confederation or the German
and the Swiss Governments just to mention some. 
Mr President,The Observatory considers that this Council has to
take decisive action to respond to the human rights crisis in Azerbaijan. And
we call on all states united here in the council to leave geopolitical and
economic interests aside and to take a stand for human rights in Azerbaijan.It is time for this Council to join the call for the
immediate and unconditional release of all arbitrarily jailed human rights
defenders and journalists before it is too late.We thank you
Mr. President.
