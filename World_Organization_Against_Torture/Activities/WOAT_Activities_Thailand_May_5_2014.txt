The Observatory for the Protection of Human
Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the International Federation for Human
Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent intervention in the following
situation in Thailand.
 
Description of the situation:
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable
sources about the disappearance of Mr. Porlagee Rakchongcharoen, also
known as ‘Billy’. Billy is a well-known ethnic
Karen community leader and environmental rights defender. He has been active
in promoting and protect the rights of the about 500 Karen villagers in the Kaengkrachan National Park in Petchaburi province. His
campaigns have focused on the preservation of forest land and the villagers’
traditional way of life.
 
According to
the information received, Mr. Porlagee
“Billy” Rakchongcharoen was
last seen on April 17, 2014, when authorities from the Kaengkrachan
National Park detained him while he was traveling from Bangkloybon village in
Kaengkrachan National Park to another location in the Kaengkrachan district.
Billy was expected to meet with his fellow villagers and activists to prepare
for an upcoming court hearing. In 2012, the villagers filed a lawsuit against
the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment’s National Park, the Wildlife
and Plant Conservation Department, and the Head of Kaengkrachan National Park,
Wildlife and Plant Conservation Office with the Central Administrative Court.
The lawsuit alleged that park authorities destroyed houses and property
belonging to more than 20 ethnic Karen families in Bangkloybon village in July
2011, during an operation to tackle encroachment on forest land.
 
Park
authorities claimed they detained Billy for possessing a wild honeycomb and six
bottles of wild honey but released him after giving a warning later the same
day.
 
On April 24,
2014, Billy’s wife, Ms. Pinapa Pruksapan, filed a petition to the Petchaburi
Provincial Court to request an urgent investigation into Billy’s disappearance.
 
On April 30,
the Petchaburi Provincial Court summoned Kaengkrachan National Park Chief
Chaiwat Limlikitaksorn and Head of Park Conservation Unit 6 Kasem Lue-rit for questioning
in connection with Billy’s disappearance. On that day, park authorities
declared three people witnessed the release of Billy on April 17. The court
subsequently ordered the authorities to question the three witnesses and
investigate Billy's disappearance.
 
The
Observatory fears that Billy’s disappearance may be related to his activities
for the promotion and protection of the rights of Karen communities in the area, and calls upon the authorities of Thailand to
take prompt action in order to disclose his whereabouts and to guarantee in all
circumstances his physical and psychological integrity.
 
Actions requested:
 
Please write
to the authorities of Thailand asking them to:
 
Guarantee in all circumstances the physical
     and psychological integrity of Mr. Porlagee
     “Billy” Rakchongcharoen
     as well as all human rights defenders in Thailand;
 
Take prompt action
     in order to disclose the whereabouts of Mr. Porlagee “Billy”
     Rakchongcharoen;
 
Order an
     immediate, thorough, effective and impartial investigation into
     the above-mentioned facts, the result of which must be made public,
     in order to identify all those responsible, bring them before a
     competent and impartial civil tribunal and apply to them the penal
     sanctions provided by the law;
 
Put an end to all acts of harassment,
     including at the judicial level, against them as well as against all human
     rights defenders in Thailand and
     ensure in all circumstances that they are able to carry out their
     legitimate activities without any hindrance or fear of reprisals;
 
Conform with the provisions of the UN
     Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of
     the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially: 
-
its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in
association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and
realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and
international levels”, and 
-
Article 12.2, which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures
to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually
and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de

as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in
the present Declaration”;
 
Ensure in all circumstances respect for
     human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international
