The Observatory for the Protection
of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the International Federation
for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT),
requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in the Islamic
Republic of Iran.
 
Description of the situation:
 
The Observatory has been informed by
the Iranian League for the Defense of Human Rights of the arbitrary arrest of
five human rights lawyers.
 
According to the information
received, Ms. Sara (Hajar) Sabaghian, Ms. Maryam Karbasi and Ms. Maryam
Kianersi, three women lawyers active in the defense of journalists,
bloggers, young people and in the defense of women sentenced to death, were
arrested on November 13 at Tehran airport as they were coming back from a trip
to Turkey.
 
Their arrest for “activities against
State security” was confirmed by the Tehran Revolutionary Prosecutor, who added
that two other lawyers had also been arrested “in relation with the three
women”, without giving further details. Their names were later revealed (Ms. Rosa
Gharatchorlou and Mr. Mohamad Hossein Hayeri).
 
On November 18, Ms. Rosa
Gharatchorlou and Ms. Maryam Karbasi were released and no information could be
obtained as to whether charges were pending against them. The three others
reportedly remained detained in Evin prison as of issuing this urgent appeal.
 
The Observatory denounces these
arrests and arbitrary detentions, which are representative of the increasing
wave of harassment against a number of Iranian human rights lawyers, including
against Mr. Mohammad Oliaifar, member of the Defenders of Human Rights Centre
(DHRC) detained since May 2010 [1], and against
Ms. Nasrin Sotoudeh, prominent human rights lawyer, known for defending
juveniles facing death penalty, prisoners of conscience, human rights activists
and children victims of abuse, in detention since September 4 on accusations of
"propaganda against the State" and "collusion and gathering with
the aim of acting against national security" [2].
 
Actions requested:
 
Please write to the Iranian
authorities and ask them to:
 
Guarantee in all
circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Ms. Sara (Hajar)
Sabaghian, Ms. Maryam Karbasi, Ms. Maryam Kianersi, Ms. Nasrin Sotoudeh, Mr.
Mohammad Oliaifar, Ms. Rosa Gharatchorlou Mr. Mohamad Hossein Hayeri as well as
all human rights defenders in Iran; Release Ms. Sara
(Hajar) Sabaghian, Ms. Maryam Kianersi, Ms. Nasrin Sotoudeh, Mr. Mohammad
Oliaifar, and Mr. Mohamad Hossein Hayeri immediately and unconditionally, since
their detention is arbitrary as it only aims at sanctioning their human rights
activities; Put an end to acts of
harassment - including at the judicial level - against them as well as against
all human rights defenders in Iran; Conform in any
circumstances with the provisions of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders,
adopted on December 9, 1998 by the United Nations General Assembly, in
particular:article 1, which states
that “everyone has the right, individually or in association with others, to
promote the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms
at the national and international levels”,article 9 which notably
states that  “everyone has the right, individually and in association with
others, inter alia […] to offer and provide professionally qualified legal
assistance or other relevant advice and assistance in defending human rights
and fundamental freedoms,and article 12.2 which
provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the
protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in
association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto
or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a
consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the
present Declaration”;Ensure in all
circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance
with international human rights instruments ratified by Iran.
