this anniversary with a dedicated event in Brussels.The event will take place at 15:15 on Wednesday the 3rd December 2014 at the Square conference centre The
 discussions will build on the momentum generated by the Convention's 
anniversary and bring together key stakeholders to exchange good 
practice, positive experiences and suggestions on how to better and more
 quickly achieve our aim of eradicating torture. The event is also an 
opportunity to provide input to how combatting torture and 
ill-treatment can be covered in the EU Action Plan on Human Rights and 
Democracy for 2015-2017. In this spirit, a

of backgrounds. It will be followed by a debate in plenary. The event will be held on Chatham House Rule. Please note that interpretation will be provided in English, French and Spanish.
