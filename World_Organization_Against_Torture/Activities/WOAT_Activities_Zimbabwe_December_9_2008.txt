New information: The Observatory has been informed by the Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum about the abduction and subsequent enforced disappearance of Mr. Broderick Takawira, provincial coordinator of the Zimbabwe Peace Project (ZPP), of Mr. Pascal Gonzo, ZPP driver, as well as about the ongoing enforced disappearance of Ms. Jestina Mukoko, Director of the ZPP and Board Member of the Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum. According to the information received, on December 8, 2008, Messrs. Takawira and Gonzo were abducted by at least five men at the ZPP offices in Harare, after one of the abductors forced the ZPP security guard to “introduce” him to Mr. Takawira. As of issuing this urgent appeal, the motives of the abduction, the identity of the abductors as well as their whereabouts remain unknown; as do those of Ms. Jestina Mukoko (see Reminder of the situation). The Observatory was informed that Zimbabwe Human Rights Lawyers has filed a police report on these events. In addition, on December 5, 2008, Mr. Zacharia Nkomo, the brother of the leading human rights lawyer Harrison Nkomo was abducted by four unidentified men in two Toyota Virgo, as he was at his home in Masvingo[1]. Mr. Nkomo's whereabouts also remain unknown to date. The Observatory is extremely concerned by this series of enforced disappearances of Zimbabwean human rights defenders, which echoes the wave of repression denounced in the run-up to the 2008 elections. The Observatory recalls that according to Article 12.2 of the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”. The Observatory immediately refers this case to the relevant mandate-holders of the United Nations and the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights, and calls upon the international community to act towards the release of these defenders. Background information: On December 5, 2008, a group of 15 unidentified armed men, who were driving an unmarked vehicle with no registration numbers, abducted Ms. Jestina Mukoko from her home in Norton. In 2008, Ms. Jestina Mukoko has reported regularly on political violence that occurred in 2008 after the Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF), the party of President Robert Mugabe, was beaten in the first round of elections in March by the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) of opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai. Actions required: Please write to the authorities of Zimbabwe urging them to:   Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Broderick Takawira, Mr. Pascal Gonzo, Ms. Jestina Mukoko and Mr. Zacharia Nkomo, as well as of all human rights defenders in Zimbabwe;  Take prompt action in order to locate them, make public her whereabouts, and ensure their immediate release;  Put an end to all kinds of harassment against all human rights defenders in Zimbabwe;  Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually or collectively, to promote the protection and fulfilment of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, as well as above-mentioned Article 12.2;  Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by Zimbabwe.
