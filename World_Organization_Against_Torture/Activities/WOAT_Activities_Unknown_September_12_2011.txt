The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights
Defenders, a joint programme of the International Federation for Human Rights
(FIDH) and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), has received new
information and requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in
Iran. 
 
New
information:
 
The Observatory has been informed by the Iranian League for
the Defence of Human Rights (LDDHI)
of the arbitrary arrest of Mr. Abdolfattah Soltani, a lawyer and founding member of the Defenders of Human
Rights Centre (DHRC).
 
According to the information received, on September 10, 2011,
Mr. Abdolfattah Soltani was arrested outside the Islamic Revolution Court by
police officers who were holding an arrest warrant. In the afternoon, his house
and offices were also searched by four agents without warrant and who took CDs, papers,
documents and his children's laptop. 
 
At the time of publication of this Urgent Appeal, Mr.
Abdolfattah Soltani was still being held in solitary confinement at the Ministry of
Intelligence’s Section 209 inside Evin prison, but his lawyer had not been
informed of the charges against him. 
 
The Observatory strongly
condemns the arrest of Mr. Abdolfattah Soltani and denounces this new act of
harassment and intimidation against founding members of DHRC, which seem to merely aim at sanctioning their
peaceful and legitimate human rights activities. 
 
Background
information:
 
In 2008, the DHRC, established by five lawyers including
the 2003 Nobel Peace Laureate Shirin Ebadi was closed down. Moreover, on August 1, 2009, the
Vice-Prosecutor of Tehran publicly accused Ms. Shirin Ebadi and DHRC of having
established relations with foreign forces to organise a “velvet revolution” in
Iran. To date, the DHRC offices remain closed. Since then, a wave of arrests
and harassment has been launched against human rights lawyers and in particular
against the founders of the DHRC.
 
On June 16, 2009, Mr. Abdolfattah
Soltani was arrested by four plain-clothes officers. His whereabouts remained
unknown until July 7, 2009, when he was located in section 209 of Evin prison.
On August 26, 2009, he was released on payment of a USD 100,000 bail, following
70 days of arbitrary detention, including 17 days in solitary confinement.
However, since then, he remained accused of “having acted against national
security” and has not yet faced trial. Furthermore, on October 2, 2009, his
passport was seized by the authorities in order to prevent him from leaving
Iran for Germany to receive the Nuremberg International Human Rights Award. 
 
Furthermore, on July 5, 2011, Ms.
Massumeh Dehghan, Mr. Abdolfattah Soltani's wife, was summoned and detained by
the Islamic Revolution Court branch in Evin prison. Mr. Soltani, who is also
her lawyer, was not allowed to accompany her before the court. No other
information was provided about the existence of charges or the reason of the
detention. On July 10, 2011, Ms. Massumeh Dehghan was released on bail.
 
On July 8, 2009, Mr. Mohammad Ali Dadkhah, also
a lawyer and founding member of the
DHRC. was arrested together with three of his
colleagues as well as his daughter, by three plain-clothes persons, without any
warrant. His law firm was subsequently closed and doors were sealed with lead.
Mr. Dadkhah, who was accused of “keeping weapons, opium as well as documents”
evidencing links with foreign “enemies”, was released on a bail of around 700,000
US dollars on September 13, 2009. On July 3, 2011, he was informed that he had
been sentenced to nine years in prison and a 10-year ban on practising law or
teaching at university, on charges of alleged “actions and propaganda against
the Islamic regime”, pursuant to Article 698 of the Islamic Criminal Code, in
relation to the foundation of DHRC and being its spokesperson; as well as his
representation in a case against Isfahan’s Metro for endangering national
heritage monuments. The trial was held on May 21, 2011 and related to a
criminal case initiated in 2009. Mr. Dadkhah has 20 days to lodge an appeal
against the sentence. As of issuing this Urgent Appeal he remained free on
bail.
 
In addition, Mr. Mohammad Seifzadeh,
also a founder of DHRC, was sentenced on October 29, 2010 to nine years
imprisonment and to a ten years ban to practice as lawyer by Branch 15 of the
Revolutionary Court, on charges of “acting against national security” through
founding the DHRC, and “propaganda against the regime” through interviews with
foreign media. He is detained since April 11, 2011 and has appealed his
sentence. In June 2011, Mr. Seifzadeh’s family was told that the appeal court
had reduced his prison sentence to two years.
