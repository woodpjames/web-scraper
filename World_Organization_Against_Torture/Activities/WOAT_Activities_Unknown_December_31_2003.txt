Among these victims, one can list 47 women and 71 men. Out of these 118 victims, 29 are children.  During this period, out of a total of 71 assistance grants: - 16 assistance grants were of a medical type (22,50% of total grants of assistance); - 39 assistance grants were of a legal type (55% of total grants of assistance); - 16 assistance grants were of a social type (22,50% of total grants of assistance).  Victims assisted within the framework of the Urgent Assistance to Victims of Torture programme are direct or indirect victims of torture according to article 1 of the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Considering the urgent assistance provided in 2003, acts of torture were perpetrated by State agents in the majority of cases, notably: guards, law enforcement agents and soldiers. Ones should add to these victims of State violence, victims of acts of torture perpetrated by occupation armies.  In terms of urgent assistance to victims of torture, OMCT’s approach is global. It is indeed not enough only to provide assistance corresponding to the physical and psychological injuries that the victim has sustained. It is crucial that the victim is able to obtain redress for this suffering. This includes rehabilitation, adequate compensation, reintegration within society, and punishment of the perpetrators.
