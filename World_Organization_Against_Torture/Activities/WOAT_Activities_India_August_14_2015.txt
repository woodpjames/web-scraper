The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of
the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and the International Federation
for Human Rights (FIDH), requests your urgent intervention in the following
situation in India.
Description
of the situation:
The
Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the ,
arbitrary detention
and harassment of Mr. Durbadal Majumder, Jalpaiguri District human rights monitor for Banglar Manabadhikar Suraksha Mancha (MASUM), a member
organisation of OMCT. Mr. Majumder has been involved in campaigns against the
use of torture by the police and Border Security Forces in the area. He was
recently doing fact finding over the alleged domestic violence amounting to
torture suffered by Ms. Namita Barman by her husband, Mr Prithiraj Barman, a
police officer in the district.
According to
the information received, on August 2, 2015, Mr. Majumder visited the
Bhaktinagar Police Station with a Sub Divisional Officer Court’s order to collect
Ms. Barman's belongings. The police officers told him that they would call Ms.
Barman to arrange the delivery of her belongings, and she received a call on
August 5 telling her that she could collect her belongings at Laketown the
following day.
On August 6,
2015 at around 2.30 p.m., Mr. Majumder accompanied Ms. Barman to the agreed
area. After retrieving the belongings, they were riding in a minivan back home
when the driver informed them that the vehicle had been seized by the police
and was forced to go New Jalpaiguri outpost for further enquiry. When they
arrived at the outpost, Mr. Prithiraj Barman, Ms. Namita Barman’s husband, arrived wearing in a police officer's vest
and asked for Mr. Majumder’s identification and about his human rights
activities and his organisation. Mr. Barman verbally harassed and abused Mr.
Majumder, accusing him of being in an illicit relationship with his estranged
wife. The police officers who were at the scene did not intervene.
Mr. Majumder
was then arbitrarily detained in
police custody[1] overnight without access
to food until the next day at 10.30 a.m., when he was forced by a police
officer to sign a document paper without being allowed to read it. He was then
informed that Mr. Barman had filed a complaint against him for alleged threats
to a police officer, and that consequently a criminal case had been opened
against him.
The
Observatory recalls that this is not the first episode of harassment against
members of the organisation MASUM[2]
and calls on the authorities to stop any form of harassment against the
association.
The
Observatory condemns the arbitrary arrest of Mr. Majumder, as well as the
charges against him, which seem to be aimed at punishing him for his legitimate
and peaceful human rights activities. 
Actions
requested:
Please write
to the authorities of India asking them to:
Put an end to any form of harassment
against Mr. Majumder and drop all charges against him.
Guarantee in all circumstances the physical
and psychological integrity of Mr. Majumder, as well as of all human
rights defenders in India;

fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”; and Article
12.2, which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to
ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually
and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto

consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the
present Declaration”;
