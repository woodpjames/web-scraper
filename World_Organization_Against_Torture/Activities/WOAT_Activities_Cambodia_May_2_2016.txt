We, the undersigned human rights and other civil society
organisations, condemn in the strongest terms the politically-motivated charging
of six human rights defenders from a Cambodian human rights group, the country’s
National Election Committee (NEC) and the United Nation’s Office of the High
Commissioner for Human Rights (UNOHCHR). The targeting of these individuals,
five of whom were sent to pre-trial detention today, is the latest escalation
in a far-reaching government assault on civil society ahead of upcoming local
and national elections, and is a clear reprisal for support provided by rights
workers in a politically-sensitive case. (c) Licadho
Four senior staff of the Cambodian Human Rights and Development
Association (ADHOC) – Ny Sokha, Nay Vanda, Yi Soksan and Lim Mony – were today charged
with bribery of a witness under Criminal Code Article 548 and sent to CC1 and
CC2 prisons in Phnom Penh. In addition, former ADHOC staffer Ny Chakrya,
recently appointed deputy secretary-general of the NEC, and UNOHCHR staffer Soen
Sally were charged as accomplices to bribery of a witness (Criminal Code
Articles 29 & 548). Ny Chakrya was sent to Police Judiciare (PJ) prison. If
convicted, all six could be sentenced to between five and ten years’
imprisonment.
The six human rights defenders were summonsed by the Anti-Corruption Unit
(ACU) for questioning last week and all but the UNOHCHR staffer subject to at least four days of
interrogation – firstly by the ACU and then by the prosecutor – in relation to
a complaint signed by Khom Chandaraty, also known as Srey Mom. The complaint
was lodged following her questioning by anti-terrorism police and a prosecutor about
an alleged affair with deputy opposition leader Khem Sokha, after ADHOC responded
to Srey Mom’s request for legal and material assistance. In the context of such
support, ADHOC provided Srey Mom with $204 to cover food and transport costs,
including to attend questioning by judicial authorities. This legitimate expenditure of a
small sum of money to cover basic expenses of a client is now grotesquely being
portrayed by the ACU as bribery and corruption.
The targeting of UNOHCHR staffer Soen Sally by the ACU and the court
has disregarded his diplomatic immunity as an employee of the United Nations.
The ACU, and later the Prime Minister himself, both argued that Soen Sally does
not enjoy such protection. 
The case is a farcical use of both the criminal justice system and
state institutions as tools to intimidate, criminalise and punish the
legitimate activities of human rights defenders and civil society. The ACU was
created to tackle the endemic corruption prevalent in Cambodia, not to operate
as a vehicle for government repression of civil society. The involvement of Ministry
of Interior Central Security officers alongside ACU personnel dealing with the
case clearly demonstrates the securitization of civil society activities. 
Under international human rights
law, including treaties that Cambodia has ratified, Cambodia is legally bound
to respect and protect the human rights of all people under its jurisdiction,
including the rights to freedom from arbitrary deprivation of liberty, and freedom
of expression, association and peaceful assembly.   
“The charges brought against the six human rights defenders are
blatantly politically-motivated and a direct attack against those serving people
who fall prey to Cambodia’s government,” said Naly Pilorge, LICADHO director.
“These mounting attacks represent an alarming tightening of the noose around
civil society and those who work to uphold human rights, and clearly show that
the government’s ultimate aim is total control ahead of the upcoming elections.”
Civil society reiterates its strong condemnation of the charges,
demands the release on bail of the five and reaffirms the rights and
fundamental freedoms of peaceful human rights defenders to conduct their
activities free from threats and punishment. We further call for the judicial
investigation to be conducted impartially and call for an end to executive
interference in the judiciary.
