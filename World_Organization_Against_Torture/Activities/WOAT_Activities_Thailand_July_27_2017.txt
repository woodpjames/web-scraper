Judicial harassment
Thailand
July 27, 2017
 
The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a partnership of the
World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and FIDH, has received new
information and requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in
Thailand.
 
New information:
 
The
Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about
the ongoing judicial harassment against seven members of the Khon Rak Ban Kerd Group (KRBKG), a
community-based group committed to the defence of the local environment from
the negative impacts of an open-pit copper-gold mine, operated by the Tungkum
company in Thailand’s Loei Province[1].

According
to the information received, on July 25, 2017, Ms. Pornthip Hongchai, Ms. Viron
Rujichaiyavat, Ms. Ranong Kongsaen,
Ms. Mon Khunna, Ms. Suphat Khunna, Ms. Boonraeng Srithong, and Ms. Lumplearn
Ruengrith, seven women members of KRBKG, were formally indicted by the Loei
Provincial Court Prosecutor under Articles 4, 8, 10, 27 and 28 of the Public
Assembly Act and Sections 83, 91 and 309 of
the Criminal Code. The seven defenders were briefly placed in
the custody of the court while they awaited indictment and a bail order. At
around 2pm, the seven women were granted temporary release without the
requirement of a bail deposit but on the condition that they report themselves
to Loei Provincial
Court on August 11, 2017 and on any subsequent
occasions when ordered by the court until the trial is completed.

 
The seven were indicted for
their involvement in legitimate human rights activities on November 16, 2016,
when more than 200 KRBKG members and villagers marched from Ban Na Nong Bong village
to the Khao
Laung Sub-District Administrative Council Office in Loei Province,
and peacefully staged a peaceful sit-in protest in front of the Council meeting
room. The protest was aimed at demanding community participation in the
decision-making process ahead of a scheduled meeting of the Council to decide
whether to grant Tungkum permission to use forest land for their mining
operations.
Members of the Administrative Council ultimately called off the scheduled
meeting due to the protest and filed a complaint with the police (see background information).
 
The
Observatory recalls that this case is one of the 21 criminal and civil
complaints initiated against villagers in Loei Province, 19 of which were filed
by Tungkum. Thai authorities filed the two other complaints against the
villagers. Tungkum previously brought a defamation lawsuit
against three of the seven women, Ms. Viron Rujichaiyavat, Ms. Pornthip Hongchai, and Ms. Mon Khunna[2], before the
Loei Provincial Court dismissed the case
on March 30, 2016.
 
The
Observatory strongly condemns the acts of ongoing judicial harassment against
the seven women and other members of KRBKG, which only aims at punishing them
for their legitimate human rights activities. The Observatory calls upon both the Thai judicial
authorities and Tungkum to end all forms of
harassment - including at the judicial level - against all of the above-mentioned defenders, and drop all charges against them.
 
Background information:
 
On March 8, 2017, police in Wang
Saphung District, Loei Province, charged the seven women KRBKG members for
allegedly violating Article 309 of Thailand’s Criminal Code for
forcing local council members to cancel a scheduled meeting.
In addition, Ms. Pornthip Hongchai, one of the leaders and
spokespersons of KRBKG, was charged under Articles 10
and 28 of the Public Assembly Act for failing to notify the authorities about
the protest. The case was then transferred to the Public Prosecutor to
decide whether to indict the women based on the police investigation.
 
On
June 13, 2017, the police filed additional charges against the seven women
under Articles 8 and 24 of the Public Assembly Act for holding a public
gathering that blocks entries or disrupts service of government agencies. The
offense carries a maximum penalty of six months in prison and a 10,000 THB (258 EUR) fine, or
both.
 
On June 27, 2017, the Public
Prosecutor again postponed the indictment of the seven women KRBKG members. The
indictment was originally scheduled for May 25, 2017, but was postponed first
to June 27, 2017 and finally to July 25, 2017. The
Observatory considers this series of postponements amounts to additional
harassment against the seven defenders.
 
The
seven women human rights defenders are each facing up to five years in prison
and a 100,000 THB (about 2,586 EUR) fine, or both. Ms. Pornthip Hongchai faces
additional fine of up to 10,000 THB (258 EUR) for the extra charge under
Article 10 of the Public Assembly Act.

from six communities near the mine formed the KRBKG in 2007 to advocate for a
clean environment and to oppose the mining operations. On March 7, 2016, the
National Human Rights Commission of Thailand honoured women of the KRBKG with a
prestigious human rights defenders award for their role in bringing attention
to critical human rights problems in Thailand.
