Brief description of the situation :  The International Secretariat of the OMCT was informed by a reliable source of the very worrying situation of Mr Belkacem Hakimi.  Mr Hakimi, who’s death sentence (september 1985) was commuted ten years later to prison for life is currently in detention at the Oukacha jail in Casablanca.  Mr Hakimi suffers from a serious rheumatic disease called ankylosing spondylitis, which attacks the spine. For over a year now he could not ambulate but in a wheel-chair or with the help of fellow-detainees. Lately he started suffering from a loss of sensation in the right side of his body.   Since he started an unlimited hunger strike on 21 August, claiming for medical tests, Mr Hakimi finally got examined and underwent a RMI on 6 September. According to the results of the tests, Mr Hakimi should receive a very heavy treatment which seemingly cannot be given in jail.  In addition to that, Mr Hakimi received on 16 January 2002 a letter from His Majesty the King Mohamed VI writing that he was hoping he could be released soon.  The International Secretariat expresses its serious concern for Mr Belkacem Hakimi’s health and asks for his liberation in order for him to receive the required medical treatment.  Actions required  We request you kindly to write to the authorities of the Kingdom of Morocco asking them to:  i.	guarantee Mr Belkacem Hakimi’s physical and psychological integrity; ii.	order his release for humanitarian reasons, to let him receive the health care he needs; iii.	make sure he has unhindered access to the required treatment;  iv.	guarantee the respect for human rights and fundamental liberties throughout the country in conformity with the national legislations and the international norms on human rights.
