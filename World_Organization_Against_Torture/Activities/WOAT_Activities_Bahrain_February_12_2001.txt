The International Secretariat of OMCT requests your URGENT intervention in the following situation in Bahrain.  New Information  The International Secretariat of OMCT has just received confirmed information from the Bahrain Human Rights Organization (BHRO), a member of the OMCT network, that Abdul-Wahab Hussain, Shaikh Hassan Sultan, Hassan Musheima, and Sayyed Ibrahim Adnan al-Alawi were all unconditionally released on 5th February 2001.  According to the information received, they were part of a group of 289 political prisoners and detainees pardoned by the government of Bahrain.  Brief reminder of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT and the BHRO expressed their grave concerns over the continuing arbitrary detention of a group of four political prisoners in Bahrain, held since January 1996 without charge or trial.  The four, all prominent figures, were arrested on 22 January 1996. Their arrest followed mass protests against the closure by security forces of a number of mosques where prominent opposition leaders, including the above-mentioned, had been peacefully calling on the government to restore the parliament and reinstate the 1973 constitution.  Remarks  The International Secretariat of OMCT welcomes their release and wishes to thank all those institutions, organizations and individuals who intervened on their behalf.  Geneva, 12th February 2001.
