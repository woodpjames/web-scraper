The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a
partnership of FIDH and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), has
received new information and requests your urgent intervention in
the following situation in Thailand.
 
New information:
 
The
Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the continued
arbitrary detention of student and pro-democracy activist Mr. Jatuphat Boonpattaraksa (aka Pai), a
member of the Dao Din group[1] and the New Democracy Movement (NDM)[2].
 
According
to the information received, on February 1, 2017, the Khon Kaen Provincial
Court approved the police request to detain Mr. Jatuphat for 12 more days. The
court also refused to grant him bail for the sixth time. The hearing was held
behind closed doors and individuals who wanted to support Mr. Jatuphat were
prevented from entering the courtroom. The court set the next hearing to
consider the police request for an extension of Mr. Jatuphat’s detention for
February 10, 2017. On February 6, 2017, the court announced that the upcoming
hearing would be held behind closed doors. 
 
The
latest extension of Mr. Jatuphat’s detention stemmed from a police request to
be given more time to examine CDs belonging to Mr. Jatuphat that could be used
as evidence against the defendant.
 
Mr.
Jatuphat is being detained in Khon Kaen Provincial Correctional Institution
on lese-majesté charges under Article 112 of the Criminal Code and the Computer
Crimes Act. The charges stem from a Facebook post in which Mr. Jatuphat shared
a critical profile of Thai King Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun,
published on the British
Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) Thai language service’s website on December
2, 2016. 
 
Since
the beginning of his detention, Mr. Jatuphat has lost six kilograms and has
been subjected to abusive cavity searches on several occasions after he returned
to the Khon Kaen Provincial Correctional Institution from court hearings.
 
The
Observatory noted that, to date, Mr. Jatuphat is the only individual who
has been arrested and charged among the approximately 3,000 web users who
shared the BBC profile of
the Thai King on Facebook.
The
Observatory condemns the arbitrary detention and judicial harassment of
Mr. Jatuphat, which seem only to be aimed at sanctioning his legitimate
human rights activities.
 
The
Observatory urges Thai authorities to ensure Mr. Jatuphat’s physical and
psychological integrity and to immediately and unconditionally release
him.
 
Background information:
 
Arrested
on December 3, 2016, Mr. Jatuphat was released on a 400,000 Thai baht
(approx. 10,620
Euros) bail the following day. However, on
December 22, 2016, the Khon Kaen Provincial Court approved a police
request to revoke Mr. Jatuphat’s bail after he posted a sarcastic Facebook message
that read: “The economy is poor so they [the authorities] took my bail
money”.
 
On
January 6, 2017, the Khon Kaen Provincial Court read behind closed
doors the Supreme Court’s decision to dismiss a motion to overturn the
bail revocation order filed by Mr. Jatuphat’s lawyers on December 29,
2016. On the same day, the Khon Kaen Provincial Court approved
the police request to detain Mr. Jatuphat for another 12 days,
from January 9 to 20, 2017.
 
On
January 13, 2017, the Khon Kaen Provincial Court refused to grant bail to
Mr. Jatuphat for the fifth time. In addition, on January 16, 2017, the
same court rejected a request filed by Mr. Jatuphat’s legal team that
sought the release of their client so he could sit his final exam at
Khon Kaen University on January 17-18, 2017. The exam is mandatory to
complete his bachelor’s degree in law.
 
On
January 20, 2017, following a hearing behind closed doors, the Khon Kaen
Provincial Court approved the police request for an extension of Mr. Jatupat’s
detention from 21 January 21 to February 1, 2017, citing the ongoing
investigation.
