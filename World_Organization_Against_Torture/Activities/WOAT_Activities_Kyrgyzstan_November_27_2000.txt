Description of the situation :  The Observatory has been informed by the Kyrgyz Committee for Human Rights (KCHR), that Mr. Ravshan Gapirov, the Director of the Kara-Suu Human Rights Center "Pravosudie Istina", was arrested on November 21st 2000. He is currently under detention in Kara-Suu ROVD (district police station).   Mr. Gapirov is being charged with hooliganism (article 234, Criminal Code of Kyrgyz Republic) and break of social order. His colleagues are certain that the charges are forged because the director of the human rights center has a long history of conflict with local militia.  In September of this year, he was severely beaten by a militia in the office Mr. Koshoev, the deputy director of Kara-Suu ROVD (see urgent appeal of the Observatory KGZ 004/0009/OBS 100).  Mr. Gapirov is also active in cross-border relations with Uzbekistan. Most recently, he led a local community's advocacy campaign to stop demolition of a historical bridge linking the two countries. Recently Mr. Gapirov's activity also focused on investigating a corruption scandal that is connected to the privatisation of the Kara-Suu Bazaar, one of the largest bazaars in the Ferghana Valley. He is also an active member of the Coalition of NGOs for Democracy and Civil Society. During the presidential elections Mr. Gapirov served as a long term election observer and helped to recruit and train more than twenty election day non-partisan observers and revealed numerous violations committed by the authorities.  The Observatory is deeply concerned by these facts which illustrate once more the repression, by Kyrgyz authorities of all the individuals who dare to denounce human rights violations and to promote fundamental freedoms.  Actions requested :   Please write to the Kyrgyz authorities demanding that they :   i.-	order Mr. Gapirov’s immediate release and ensure that all the charges against him be dropped since they are arbitrary ;   ii.-	put an end to all forms of harassment of human rights defenders and their organisations ;  iii.-	ensure the implementation of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 9, 1998 (Declaration concerning the rights and responsibilities of individuals, groups and institutions to promote and protect universally recognised human rights and fundamental liberties ) in particular its Article 1 which provides that " Every person has the right, individually or collectively, to promote the protection and fulfilment of human rights and fundamental liberties at the national and international level " and article 6.c which provides that « everyone has the right, individually and in association with others to study, discuss, form and hold opinions on the observance, both in law and in practice, of all human rights and fundamental freedoms and, through these and other appropriate means, to draw public attention to those matters ».  iv.-	guarantee the effective respect of fundamental rights and liberties in accordance with the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the international and regional Pacts and Covenants ratified by Kyrgyzstan.
