Brief description of the situation The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by Banglar Manabadhikar Suraksha Mancha (MASUM), a member of OMCT SOS-Torture Network, about the arbitrary arrest and allegations of torture and ill-treatment of 14-year-old Biswajit Mondal (son of Mr. Badol Mondal) from Murutia Bazar, 22-year-old Mintu Sk, from Musalman Para, Bapi, a driver, and of 32-year-old Ms. Khusi Mondal, by police of Murutia police station, district of Nadia, in West Bengal. According to the information received, Biswajit Mondal, Mintu and Bapi were arrested by Murutia police on 9 March 2009 without warrant of arrest and taken to Murutia police station. On 10 March 2009, Ms. Khusi Mondal was also arrested by the same police. All are reportedly suspected of alleged theft but none of them were presented before a competent judicial authority within 24 hours. According to the same information, all were severely beaten, including with sticks, kicks, fists and blow, by police officers at the front gate of the said police station, in view of passers-by. They have reportedly visible signs of bruises and hematoma on their legs, hands and back but the physical condition of Biswajit Mondal is reportedly very poor. All of them were brought to the hospital for medical examination. It is reported that, while Ms. Khusi Mondal was detained separately from the male detainees, Biswajit Mondal was held with the adults. Mr. Badol Mondal, Biswajit Mondal’s father, reportedly appealed before the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate on 11 March 2009, which later ordered the Sub Divisional Police Officer, Tehatto, to submit a report on the incident. On 13 March 2009, Biswajit Mondal was eventually presented before the District Juvenile Justice Board, Nadia District, and released on bail. According to the same information received, Bapi is under medical treatment at Shaktinagar District Hospital, but remains under judicial custody till his next hearing on 26 March 2009. Ms. Khusi Mondal also remains under judicial custody at Krishnanagar District Correctional Home, Nadia District, and her next hearing has been reportedly also scheduled on 26 March 2009. Mintu Sk. was reportedly presented before the court of Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Tehatta, on 11 March 2009, charged under section 290 (punishment for public nuisance) of Indian Penal Code, and then released on bail. According to the information received, on 12 March 2009, the court of Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Tehatta, requested the investigating officer of Murutia police station to report on the events, after the conclusions of the medical examinations of Biswajit Mondal and Bapi conducted at Tehatta hospital had been submitted to the court. A first report was expected to be submitted on 14 March 2009, but a new deadline was requested. Furthermore, it is reported that the officer-in-charge of Murutia police station, was requested to appear before the District Juvenile Justice Board on 18 March 2009 but no information is available on its conclusions at the time of issuing the appeal. The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned for the physical and psychological integrity of Biswajit Mondal, Mintu, Bapi and Ms. Khusi Mondal following the allegations of torture and ill-treatment. OMCT wishes to recall that according to article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which India is Party, “no one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment”. OMCT calls on the competent authorities to carry out a prompt, effective, thorough, independent and impartial investigation into these allegations, the result of which must be made public, in order to bring those responsible before a competent, independent and impartial tribunal and apply penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions as provided by law. Furthermore, OMCT recalls to India that according to article 9 (1) of the ICCPR, “no one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest or detention”. OMCT is particularly concerned about the fact that Mr. Biswajit Mondal is 14 years old and is legally a child both under international and national law and should be treated accordingly, which was reportedly not the case. OMCT calls on India to fully respect and implement both the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child to which India is party, stating that “States Parties recognize the right of every child alleged as, accused of, or recognized as having infringed the penal law to be treated in a manner consistent with the promotion of the child's sense of dignity and worth, which reinforces the child's respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of others and which takes into account the child's age and the desirability of promoting the child's reintegration and the child's assuming a constructive role in society” as well the Indian Juvenile Justice Act 2000.
