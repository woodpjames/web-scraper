New Information  The International Secretariat has been informed by Defense for Children International, Palestine Section (DCI/PL), a member of OMCT’s SOS-Torture network, that Sawsan Abu Turki was released on bail on the night of 11 January 2002 after having spent four months in preventive detention in Neve Tertze women’s prison in Ramle.   According to the information received, Sawsan Abu Turki’s family managed to raise the money necessary in order to pay her bail, however, the decision concerning her conditional liberty, which was handed down by a military tribunal, is not final and the prosecution is continuing to pursue the case against Sawsan.   Brief reminder of the situation   The International Secretariat of OMCT has received information from reliable sources concerning continued allegations of torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment amongst women and girls being held in detention at Neve Tertze prison in Ramle, Israel.   OMCT is particularly concerned by the conditions in which 14 year old Sawsan Abu Turki, who was arrested on 6 September 2001 for having attempted to stab an Israeli soldier, is being detained. At the time of her arrest, Sawsan was transferred to Abu Kabir interrogation centre where she was held with adult detainees. She was forced to sign a confession written in Hebrew, a language that she does not understand.   Sawsan has suffered from psychological problems since 1998 and was hospitalised for 3 days in July 2001  after having been hit in the head by an Israeli soldier. Following her transfer to the prison in Ramle, Sawsan was placed in an isolation cell and was never given the medication that her family brought her in order to treat her medical problems.   According to the information received, Sawsan’s physical and psychological health deteriorated as a result of the prolonged period that she spent in isolation. During the nights of 4 and 5 October, Sawsan was placed in restraints and her arms and legs were cuffed to the bed throughout the entire night. As a result of the prolonged period spent in restraints, she suffered from serious cuts to her wrists. Her psychological condition deteriorated to such an extent that she was no longer capable of clearly distinguishing her own identity.    Action required   The International Secretariat of OMCT would like to thank all of the institutions, organisations and individuals who intervened on behalf of Sawsan Abu Turki and would like to ask these individuals and groups to continue to ask the Israeli authorities to:   ·	take all of the measures necessary to guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of  Sawsan Abu Turki ;  ·	re-examine the charges laid against Sawsan Abu Turki in light of the international standards and obligations concerning juvenile justice which Israel is bound to apply;  ·	ensure that Sawsan Abu Turki fully enjoys the right to an imparital and equitable trial by a civilian court for minors while guaranteeing her right to a fair trial;  ·	undertake an urgent inquiry into the events that occurred during Sawsan Abu Turki’s preventive detention ; identify those responsible for the alleged acts of torture and ill treatment ; bring these persons before an impartial and competent civilian tribunal and apply the criminal, civil and/or administrative sanctions provided for by law ;  ·	ensure respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all children throughout the country in accordance with national law and international standards and, in particular, with the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.
