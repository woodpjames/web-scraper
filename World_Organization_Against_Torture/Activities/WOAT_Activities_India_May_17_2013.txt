harassment
India

The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of
the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and the International Federation
for Human Rights (FIDH), requests your urgent intervention in the following
situation in India.
 
Brief
description of the situation:
 
The
Observatory has been informed by reliable sources of the arbitrary detention of
Mr. Abhay Sahoo, President of the “POSCO Pratirodh Sangram Samiti”
(PPSS), a movement that has been leading a eight-year campaign against forcible
acquisition of common lands by South Korean steel giant POSCO in Jagatsinghpur district, Odisha
State (formerly Orissa State).
 
According
to the information received, on May 11, 2013, at about 9 a.m., Mr. Abhay Sahoo
was arrested by a police team from Jagatsinghpur near the Biju Patnaik airport
in Bhubaneswar, as he was about to take a flight to Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, to
take part in a conference.
 
Mr.
Abhay Sahoo was taken to Kujanga, near Paradip, Jagatsinghpur district, and charged
under section 307 (murder), 102.b (criminal conspiracy) and 34 (common
intention) of Indian Penal Code and under sections 3 (causing explosion likely
to endanger life) and 4 (attempt to cause explosion or for making explosive to
endanger life) of Explosive Substances Act, in connection to the bomb blast in
the proposed POSCO steel plant at Dhinkia village of Jagatshinghpur disctrict
on May 2, 2013, in which three PPSS supporters were killed when, according to
the police, they were making a bomb. 
 
In
the afternoon, Mr. Sahoo was produced before the judicial magistrate court in
Kujang, which rejected his bail petition and remanded him in judicial custody at
Samagola Jail (Kujang)
for 14 days.
 
The
Observatory condemns the arbitrary detention and judicial harassment against
Mr. Abhay Sahoo, which seems to merely aim at sanctioning his peaceful
activitites in the framework of the campaing against the proposed POSCO steel plant
and the related forcible acquisition of common lands farmed by villagers in
Jagatsinghpur discrict. 
 
Furthermore,
the Observatory is gravely concerned that a total of 54 cases of diferent
nature have been filed against Mr. Abhay Sahoo at different stages of the PPSS
movement. Remarkably, he has been released on bail in 50 of them. In the
framework of the ongoing harassment against Mr. Abhay Sahoo it is important to
note that he has been kept on jail in two ocassions implicated in false cases:
from October 2008 to August 2009 and from November 25, 2011 to March 14, 2012[1].
 
Actions
requested:
 
Please
write to the authorities of India, urging them to:
 
i.              
Guarantee in all circumstances the
physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Abhay Sahoo, all PPSS members as well as of all human rights
defenders in India;
 
ii.             
Release Mr. Abhay Sahoo immediately and unconditionally since his
detention is arbitrary as it seems to merely sanction his human rights
activities;
 
iii.           
Put an end to acts of any acts of
harassment - including at the judicial level - against Mr. Abhay Sahoo as well
as against all human rights defenders in India;
 
iv.

the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, in particular with
its: 
-       
Article 1, which provides that
“everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to
promote and to strive for the protection and realization of human rights and
fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”;
-       
Article 6(a), which foresees that
“everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to
participate in peaceful activities against violations of human rights and
fundamental freedoms”;
-       
Article 12.2 (“the State shall take
all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of
everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence,
threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination,
pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her
legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”);
 
v.             
More generally, ensure in all
circumstances the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in
accordance with in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
