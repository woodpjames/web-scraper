Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Asian Human Rights Commission (AHRC), a member of the OMCT network, of the unlawful arrest and the torture of two boys by police officers of the Ambalangoda police station, Sri Lanka.  According to the information received, on 7 August 2004 at about 10:30 pm, police officers attached to the Ambalangoda Police station, in civilian clothes, arrested Mr. L.A.Pradeep Kumara, 14 years old, and Mr. Lakmal Chathuranga, 15 years old, alleging that they had stolen a gold chain.  The police took the two children to the Ambalangoda Police station without any parent, whereas, according to the law, minors should be accompanied by their parents when taken into custody.  At the police station the two children were reportedly stripped naked, blind folded and then brutally assaulted with wooden poles. Meanwhile the police threatened the parents that if they did not pay Rs.3000 the police would prosecute the two children and remand them for 14 days.  The parents of both children without any alternative agreed to pay the amount. According to them they had to sign a statement that was written by the police. After that the police released the two boys on 9 August 2004. They were both severely bruised and suffering from contusions and depression. Their parents took them to the Balapitiya Government hospital where they were admitted and are presently receiving treatment in ward no.1.  OMCT expresses its grave concern over this event. OMCT remains worried about the continuing problem of police violence and intimidation in Sri Lanka and calls the government to fight it by ending impunity. OMCT would like to recall Sri Lanka, as a state party, that under article 37 “no child shall be subjected to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment” and “no child shall be deprived of his or her liberty unlawfully or arbitrarily”.   Action requested Please write to the authorities in Sri Lanka urging them to:  i. Take all necessary measures to ensure the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. L.A.Pradeep Kumara and Mr. Lakmal Chathuranga;  ii. Order a thorough and impartial investigation into the circumstances of this event, in order to bring those responsible to trial and apply the penal and/or administrative sanctions as provided by law;  iii.	Provide an adequate compensation and protection to the victims and their family;  iv.	Guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
