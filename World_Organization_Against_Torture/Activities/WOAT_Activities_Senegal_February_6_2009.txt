Brief description of the situation The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the African Assembly for the Defense of Human Rights (Rencontre africaine pour la défense des droits de l’Homme, RADDHO), a member organisation of OMCT SOS-Torture Network, about the death in detention of Mr. Mamadou Bakhoum (32 years), at Karang gendarmerie station. According to the information received, on 23 January 2009, around 9:00pm, Mr. Mamadou Bakhoum, suspected of drug trafficking, was arrested and brought to Karang gendarmerie station where he was interrogated before being placed under police custody in a security cell (commonly known as “death cell”).

OMCT recalls that “ (…) no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his life” and that “each State Party shall keep under systematic review interrogation rules, instructions, methods and practices as well as arrangements for the custody and treatment of persons subjected to any form of arrest, detention or imprisonment in any territory under its jurisdiction, with a view to preventing any cases of torture” (art. 11 of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment).
