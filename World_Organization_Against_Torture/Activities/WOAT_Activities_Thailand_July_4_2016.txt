The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of
the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and FIDH, requests your urgent
intervention in the following situation in Thailand.

Description of the situation: 
The
Observatory has been informed by reliable sources of the arrest, judicial
harassment, and restrictions to freedom of association faced by 13 activists of
the New Democracy Movement (NDM)[1],
namely Messrs. Rangsiman
Rome[2], Korakoch
Saengyenpan, Anan Loket, Thirayut Napnaram, Rackchart Wong-arthichart, Yuttana
Dasri, Worawut Butmat, Somsakol Thongsuksai, Nantapong Panmat and Misses Tueanjai Waengkham,
Pimai Ratwongsa, Konchanok Tanakhun, and Phanthip Saengathit.
According to the information received, on June 23, 2016, at around 5.30
pm, the aforementioned 13 activists were arrested by military personnel at the
market of Kan Keha Bang Phli Community on the eastern outskirt of Bangkok in Samut
Prakan Province, while handing out leaflets and other campaign material that
urged voters to reject the drat constitution in a referendum to be held on
August 7, 2016.
All the activists were apprehended and taken to the Bang Sao Thong
Police Station and their campaign material was confiscated. They were held in
police custody overnight and were all charged with violating the Head of the
National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO) Order no. 3/2558[3], which bans gatherings of five or more people, and Article 61 of the 2016
Constitutional Referendum[4], which bans the dissemination of “false information” about the draft
charter with the aim of influencing voters. If found guilty, all 13 could face
up to 10 years of imprisonment, a fine of up to 200,000 Baht (approx. 5,125
Euro), and have their right to vote revoked by court for up to 10 years under
the Referendum Act.
On June 24, 2016, the 13 activists were brought to
the pre-trial remand hearing at the Bangkok Military Court, where the police asked
the court to have them remanded for 12 days in order to provide sufficient time
to conduct the investigation, as well as for fear of repetition of the crime.
The court dismissed the motion filed by the defendants’ attorney to object to the
police request and approved the pre-trial remand.
Six
of the activists were released on a bail of 50,000 Baht (approx. 1,280 Euro) each,
under the conditions that they must “not get involved with any act aimed to
instigate, disrupt public order, persuade, compel people to rise up by any
means possible in order to make possible any public assembly which may bring
about public disorder or cause any harm or infringement on peace, order or the
moral high ground of the people or any act which may induce people to commit a
legal offence”.
The
other seven activists did not submit bail requests, arguing that they had done
nothing wrong and that they would not accept conditions for their release. They
were remanded in custody at the Bangkok Remand Prison until July 5, 2016, when
the defendants’ attorney is expected to file another motion to object to a further
remand.
The
Observatory recalls that this is not the first time that members of the NDM have
been arbitrarily arrested and detained for the legitimate exercise of their
right to freedom of expression, association, and assembly. On June 25, 2015,
the 14 NDM members were arrested and charged as a result of their campaign to
demand democracy and were finally released on July 7, 2015, after their having
been remanded in prison for 12 days[5].

The
Observatory strongly condemns the arbitrary arrest, detention, and
judicial harassment against the 13 NDM activists, which only aim at
sanctioning their legitimate human rights activities.

The Observatory calls on the Thai authorities to drop immediately and
unconditionally all charges against the 13  activists, and repeal the
Head of the NCPO Order no. 3/2558, which fails
to comply with international human rights instruments ratified by Thailand.
 
Actions
requested:
Please write to the authorities of Thailand asking them to:
i. Drop all charges against the 13 NDM activists, immediately and
unconditionally release the 7 NDM activists still detained, and end all
acts of judicial harassment against them and all human rights defenders in
Thailand;
ii.
Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of
the 13 activists;
iii.
Repeal the Head of the NCPO Order No. 3/2015 banning gatherings of five or more
people;
iv.
Guarantee that the exercise of freedom of expression and assembly are not
prosecuted under Article 116 of the Thai Criminal Code (‘sedition’);
v.
Put an end to the prosecution of civilians in military courts in accordance
with international human rights law that prohibits governments from using
military courts to try civilians when civilian courts are functioning;
vi.
Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders,
adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998,
especially its Articles 1 which states that “everyone has the right,
individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for
the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental
freedoms at the national and international levels”, and Article 12.2,
which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure
the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually
and in association with others, against any violence, threats,
retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or
any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate
exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”;
vii.
Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms
in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments
ratified by Thailand.
