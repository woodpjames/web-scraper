Brief description of the situation The International Secretariat of the OMCT has been informed by a reliable source and by Antenna International, member organisation of the OMCT SOS-Torture network, about the trial of 12 men detained in connection with a planned demonstration against the authorities in February 2007. The next hearing is reportedly to be held on 4 December 2007 before the State Security Court in Tripoli, established in September 2007. Reports indicate that they were allegedly subjected to torture and ill-treatment. Moreover, two individuals, who were arrested along with the 12 men, are reportedly disappeared. According to the information received, Mr. Jamal Alhaji (writer), Dr. Idis Bufayed, Mr. Fareed Azway (writer), Mr. Almahdi Hmeed (lawyer), Mr. Assadiq Hmeed, Mr. Faraj Hmeed, Mr. Adel Hmeed, Mr. Ali Hmeed, Mr. Ala Adrisi, Mr. Assadiq Gashoot, Mr. Bashir Alharis, Mr. Ahmad Alabeedi, Mr. Abdel rahman Al-Gteewi and Mr. Juma Bufayed, were arrested between 16 and 17 February 2007 and detained in view of their planned peaceful demonstration to take place in Tripoli to commemorate the first anniversary of the killing of at least 12 people and the injuring of score of more during a demonstration in Benghazi. Mr. Ahmad Alabeedi, Mr. Adel Hmeed, Mr. Ali Hmeed, Mr. Faraj Hmeed, Mr. Almahdi Hmeed, Mr. Assadiq Hmeed and Mr. Fareed Azway were reportedly presented on 20 April 2007 before a court in the district of Tajoura in Tripoli and then detained at the Aljadidah prison in Tripoli. Dr. Idis Bufayed, Mr. Assadiq Gashoot, Mr. Ala Adrisi, Mr. Jamal Alhaji, and Mr. Bashir Alharis were also reportedly presented before the same court but were then transferred to Ain-Zara prison in Tripoli, after allegedly being detained for at least two months in a detention centre operated by the Internal Security Agency in Sikka Street, aka 7th November Street, in Tripoli. The 12 men were reportedly charged with offences including possession of weapons, conspiracy against the "Public Authority", conspiring and contact with foreign enemies, encouraging violence against the State. If they are found guilty, they might reportedly face death penalty. According to the same information, none of the 12 men were able to meet their lawyers outside the court room. A hearing reportedly took place on 20 November 2007 but was postponed to 4 December 2007 because of the absence of two lawyers appointed by the judge. Moreover, only those detained at Aljadidah prison were reportedly present at the hearing. According to the information, all prisoners have allegedly complained to have suffered acts of torture in the first five months of their arrest. Mr. Faraj Hmeed and Mr. Almahdi Hmeed were allegedly punched and beaten with wooden implements, subjected to falaqa (beating on the soles of the feet) and placed in a coffin as a form of intimidation during at least one interrogation session. They had reportedly to receive medical treatment as a result. Moreover, those detained at Ain-Zara prison were allegedly kept in the basement without any light for months. While the men detained at the Aljadidha prison were allowed a few family visits (although on an irregular basis), the detainees at the Ain-Zara prison were allegedly not allowed any. Furthermore, reports indicate that Mr. Ahmad Alabeedi, Mr. Jamal Alhaji and Mr. Fareed Azway are in very poor health condition. Mr. Fareed Azway reportedly suffers from chronic eye problem and is mentally stressed. Regarding Mr. Abdel rahman Al-Gteewi’s and Mr. Juma Bufayed, their whereabouts remain unknown since their arrest in February 2007. The International Secretariat of OMCT is very much concerned about the forced disappearance of Mr. Abdel rahman Al-Gteewi and Mr. Juman Bufayed, being at particular risk of torture and ill-treatment. Moreover, OMCT expresses it concern with the detention and trial of the 12 above-mentioned individuals, who according to the information received seemed to be effectively punished for their peaceful political opposition to or criticism of the government. OMCT calls for their immediate and unconditional release in the absence of valid legal charges, or, if such charges exist, bring them before an impartial, independent, competent and fair tribunal and guarantee their procedural rights at all times OMCT recalls that Libya is a State party to the UN Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which both prohibit cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. In line with their obligations under these treaties, it is incumbent on the Libyan authorities to consider seriously any allegations of torture and ill-treatment made by the victim, and to undertake a thorough investigation in this regard. OMCT also recalls to Libya that according to article 9 1) of the ICCPR “no one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest or detention”.
