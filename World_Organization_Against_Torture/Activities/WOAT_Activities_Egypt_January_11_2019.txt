Judicial harassment

The Observatory for the Protection of
Human Rights Defenders, a partnership of the World Organisation Against Torture
(OMCT) and FIDH, has received new information and requests your urgent
intervention in the following situation in Egypt.
 
New information:
 
The Observatory has been
informed by reliable sources about the sentencing and ongoing judicial
harassment against Ms. Amal Fathy, a women’s
rights defender known for being vocal against human rights violations, in
particular the arbitrary detention of activists in Egypt. Ms. Amal Fathy is
married to Mr. Mohamed Lotfy, Executive Director
of the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF)[1]. 
 
On December 30, 2018, the
Cairo Court of Appeal rejected Ms. Amal Fathy’s appeal and confirmed a two-year
jail sentence and a fine of 10,000 Egyptian pounds (around 474 EUR) on charges
of “publication of false news undermining national security”, “possession of
indecent material”, and “publicly insulting the State” under Case No. 7991 of
2018 for posting a video on Facebook denouncing human rights violations. 
 
This sentence follows her
recent conditional release, on December 27, 2018, under Case No. 621 of 2018,
in which she is facing charges of “joining a terrorist group”, “publishing
false news to disrupt public security and harm national interests” and “using
the internet to call for acts of terrorism” (see background information). This
release was only enforced nine days after publication of the court order, on
December 18, 2018.
 
On January 2, 2019, her
husband appealed to the President of Egypt to grant pardon in favour of Ms.
Amal Fathy in Case No. 7991 of 2018.
 
The Observatory recalls
that Ms. Amal Fathy’s health condition is deteriorating as she suffers from
acute stress reaction caused by her arbitrary detention and by the harassment
she has been subjected to prior to her arrest. 
 
The Observatory is extremely concerned by the
sentencing and ongoing judicial harassment of Ms. Fathy, which only aims at
punishing her for her legitimate work in defence of human rights and which
represents a serious infringement of her right to freedom of expression.
Therefore, the Observatory urges the Egyptian authorities to immediately and
unconditionally put an end to all acts of harassment, including at the judicial
level, and drop all charges against her. 
 
Background information:
 
On May 9, 2018,
Ms. Amal Fathy posted a 12-minute video on Facebook criticising
the Egyptian Government for its failure to protect women against sexual
harassment, as well as over a general deterioration of living conditions
in the country.
 
The next day,
pro-government and State-owned media outlets released articles citing the
video, identifying Ms. Amal Fathy as an “April 6 Youth movement” activist and
accusing her of insulting Egypt and Egyptian institutions. This was followed by
a wave of harassment and threats on social media against Ms. Amal Fathy.
 
On May 11, 2018, at around
2.30 am, Egyptian security forces raided the house of Ms. Amal Fathy and Mr.
Mohamed Lotfy in Cairo and started searching it. Their mobile phones were
seized and they were denied the right to communicate with a lawyer or their relatives.
The two activists were brought to Maadi police station, in southern Cairo,
along with their three-year-old son.
 
Around three hours later,
Mr. Lotfy and his son were released. The Maadi Prosecutor subsequently placed
Ms. Amal Fathy under preventive detention for 15 days within the framework
of Criminal case No. 7991 of 2018.
 
On May 12, 2018,
Ms. Amal Fathy was transferred to Qanater women’s prison. 
 
On May 13, 2018, Ms. Amal
Fathy was questioned by the High State Security Prosecution about the “April 6 Youth
Movement”, ECRF and the activities of her husband. She was then placed under
preventive detention for an additional 15 days in the framework of another
case, Criminal case No. 621 of 2018 in relation to her suspected participation
in the April 6 Youth Movement and her husband’s human rights activities.
 
On May 24, the Maadi
Prosecutor extended Ms. Amal Fathy’s preventive detention for 15 additional
days within the framework of Case No. 7991 of 2018, without providing reason.
Ms. Fathy appealed the decision. On May 30, 2018, Ms. Fathy’s appeal was
rejected. 
 
On June 7, 2018, the Maadi
Prosecutor extended for the third time Ms. Amal Fathy’s preventive detention
for a further 2-week period, without providing any reason.
 
On June 21, 2018, the Criminal
Court of South Cairo approved the release on bail of Ms. Amal Fathy within the
framework of Case No. 7991 of 2018 upon payment of a 10,000 EGP guarantee
(approximately 480 EUR). She remained nonetheless in detention pending
investigation within the framework of Case No. 621 of 2018.
 
On July 2, 2018 and July
30, 2018, the National Security Prosecution Office extended Ms. Amal Fathy
pre-trial detention for the fifth and sixth time for a further 15-day period.
 
On September 29, 2018,
the Maadi Misdemeanours
Court in Cairo sentenced Ms. Amal Fathy to two years in prison, a fine of
10,000 Egyptian pounds (around 474 EUR) and a bail of 20,000 Egyptian pounds
(around 950 EUR) to suspend the sentence, under Case No. 7991 of 2018. On September 30, 2018, she
appealed the case and paid the bail. 
 
On October 14, 2018,
October 28, 2018, and November 12, 2018, the State security prosecution and the
Criminal Court extended for three consecutive times Ms. Fathy’s detention. 
 
On December 18, 2018, the Criminal Court approved Ms.
Amal Fathy’s release on bail pending trial under Case No. 621 of 2018.

that ECRF and its members are subjected to harassment, due to their
documentation of cases of torture in prisons, enforced disappearances as well
as their legal support in Giulio Regeni’s case (See Observatory Urgent Appeal EGY 004 / 0917 / OBS 105, published on September 27, 2017)
