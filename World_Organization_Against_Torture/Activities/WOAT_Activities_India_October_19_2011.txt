Follow-up of case IND 250811
Threats and
intimidation/ Lack of a proper investigation/ Fear for the safety 
The International
Secretariat of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) has received new information and requests your URGENT
intervention in the following situation inthe India/ West Bengal.
New information
The International Secretariat of OMCT has been
informed by Banglar
Manabadhikar Suraksha Mancha (MASUM),
a member of OMCT SOS-Torture Network, that Mr. Rabiul Gazi, a Muslim man
from the village of East Jainagar, Purbapara, aged about 28 years old and boat
driver in Mumbai, who was severely beaten by members of the Border Security
Force (BSF) in June 2011, was threatened by a BSF Company Commander to withdraw
the complaint he lodged with the police. OMCT is gravely concerned about his
safety and the safety of his family.  
According to the information
received, on 16 September 2011, at about 10:30 am, one BSF Company Commander from the 47th
Battalion, who is known in the area, went to Mr. Rabiul Gazi’s house dressed in
plain-clothes. He spoke in broken Bangla and told Mr. Rabiul Gazi’s father in a
threatening voice to withdraw the complaint against the BSF members or the
family would face serious consequences. He reportedly forced Mr. Rabiul Gazi’s
father to sign on a paper that he had brought along with him as well as to take
15,000 Rupees in exchange for withdrawing the complaint. Mr. Rabiul Gazi was
not present at the time. 
OMCT recalls that, on 23 June 2011, Mr. Rabiul Gazi had lodged a complaint with
the Superintendent of Police, Barasat, North 24 Parganas against the alleged
BSF members who ill-treated him. To date, the complaint has not been formally
registered by the police in violation of the Indian Code of Criminal Procedure,
and no investigation has been carried out into the allegations. 
OMCT is gravely concerned about
the safety of Mr. Rabiul Gazi and of his family and urges the competent
authorities to guarantee their safety, at all times, and adequately protect
them from further intimidation. OMCT recalls that the victims
of torture and ill-treatment must be ensured an effective remedy for the human
rights violations suffered, and the right to reparation with compensation and
rehabilitation.
Accordingly, OMCT is gravely
concerned about the delays in initiating an investigation into the allegations
of ill-treatment suffered by Mr. Rabiul Gazi and therefore calls on the competent
authorities to ensure that an investigation is carried out promptly, effectively, thoroughly, independently and impartially, in
accordance with international human rights standards, the result of which must
be made public, in orderto bring
those responsible before a competent, independent and impartial tribunal and
apply penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions as provided by law.
Background
information
OMCT had earlier been informed about the severe
beating inflicted by members of the BSF on Mr. Rabiul Gazi. According to the information received, on 15
June 2011, at
about 4 pm, Mr.
Rabiul Gazi, who was visiting his family in the village of East Jainagar, was going to his mother’s hut when he was
restrained by two BSF members, alleged to be from the Garbda BSF Camp,
Company-F, Battalion 47. One of them accused Mr. Rabiul Gazi of being a
smuggler. Mr. Rabiul Gazi reportedly denied the allegations by saying that he
was working in Mumbai and that he could show them his working card. However,
both BSF members allegedly got furious about his response and started to
severely beat him all over his body with their wooden sticks and rifle butts.
The BSF members also reportedly insulted him, and made comments on his religion
and social background (he is a beneficiary of the Below Poverty Line programme)[1].
When Mr. Rabiul Gazi’s mother and aunt saw what was happening, they urged the
BSF members to stop beating him. However, these latter refused and violently
pushed Mr. Rabiul Gazi’s aunt. Mr. Rabiul Gazi was then reportedly handcuffed
and taken to Garbda camp, where he was arbitrarily detained for more than three
hours. He was also denied access to a doctor and medical treatment. Mr. Rabiul
Gazi was only released later when his father and a villager came to the BSF
camp. However, before his release, he had reportedly to sign on a blank page. 
According to the same information received, Mr. Rabiul
Gazi was subsequently taken to Basirhat Sub-division Hospital. However, when he said that he was beaten
by the BSF, he reportedly did not receive an adequate medical treatment and he
was not given his injury report. Mr. Rabiul Gazi only later received medical
care from a local village doctor.
