The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a
partnership of FIDH and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), requests
your urgent intervention in the following situation in Bahrain.
 
Description of the situation:
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the judicial
harassment of Sheikh Maytham Al-Salman, an internationally respected
interfaith leader and a human rights defender advocating for religious freedom
and countering violent extremism. 
 
According to the information received, on August 14, 2016, Sheikh
Maytham Al-Salman was summoned to Hamad police station for questioning, without
being allowed to be assisted by a lawyer. He was then interrogated for 26 hours
without sleep, before being released on bail on charges of “illegal gathering”
in relation to his participation in an open-ended sit-in in Duraz, which
started on June 20, 2016, to denounce the arbitrary revocation of the
citizenship of a Shia leader, Sheikh Isa Qasim, by the Bahraini authorities.
 
Sheikh Maytham Al-Salman is currently under a travel ban, and no date
has yet been scheduled for the first hearing. 

 
The Observatory denounces the judicial harassment and obstacles to his
freedom of movement faced by Sheikh Maytham Al-Salman, which seems to be merely
aimed at sanctioning his legitimate human rights activities.
 
Moreover, the Observatory recalls that Bahraini authorities have harassed Sheikh Maytham on numerous occasions,
including two separate incidents in 2015 when he was detained for his human rights
activities. Similarly, he was summoned earlier this year in connection to the
content of a speech he gave on December 27,
2015, the anniversary of the arrest of prisoner of conscience Sheikh Ali Salman, in which he drew attention to the violations of
international fair trial standards that took place[1].
 
Accordingly, the Observatory calls upon the Bahraini authorities to
immediately and unconditionally drop all the charges against Sheikh Maytham
Al-Salman, and to put an end to any act of harassment against him - and in
general against all human rights defenders in Bahrain.
 
Until all charges are dropped against Sheikh Maytham Al-Salman, the Observatory urges the Bahraini authorities to
ensure that all judicial proceedings against him are conducted in full
compliance with his right to a fair trial, as provided for under international
law.
 
Actions requested:
 
The Observatory urges the authorities of Bahrain to:
 
i. Put an end to any act of harassment, including at the judicial level,
against Sheikh Maytham Al-Salman and against all human rights defenders in
Bahrain;
 
ii. Guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of Maytham Al-Salman
and that of all human rights defenders in Bahrain;
 
iii. Conform in any circumstances with the provisions of the Declaration
on Human Rights Defenders, adopted on December 9, 1998 by the United Nations
General Assembly, in particular its Articles 1, 6 (c) and 12.2;
 
iv. Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental
freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and
international instruments ratified by Bahrain.
