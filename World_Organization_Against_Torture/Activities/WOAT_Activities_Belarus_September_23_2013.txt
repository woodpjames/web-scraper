The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of
the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation
Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent intervention in the following
situation in Belarus.
 
Description of the situation:
 
The
Observatory was informed of the confiscation of 40 copies of a book titled
“Enlightened by Belarusianness” ("Asvechanyia Belaruschunai"),
written by Mr. Ales Bialiatski, President of the Human Rights Centre
(HRC) “Viasna” and FIDH Vice-President, who is serving 4,5 years' imprisonment
in relation to his human rights activities, after they were considered as  potentially damaging the image of the country.
The 455-pages book is a digest of literary articles and essays on Belarusian
literature, and also features four texts written by Mr. Bialiatski behind bars.
 
According
to the information received, on September 5, 2013, Ms. Tatsiana Reviaka,
a member of the HRC “Viasna”, received the conclusions of an expert examination
ordered by the Ashmiany Customs Department, which alleged that Mr. Ales
Bialiatski’s book “could damage the image of the Republic of Belarus”. On September 13,
2013, Ms. Reviaka filed a complaint to the Chairman of the State Customs
Committee, urging him to conclude on the illegality of both the order for the
appointment of the examination and of its conduct.
 
On
July 3, 2013, 40 copies of the book had been confiscated from Ms. Reviaka at
the Belarusian-Lithuanian border. On July 5, 2013, a notice was sent to Ms.
Reviaka informing her that an examination would be carried out by the head of
the chief department for ideological work, youth and culture of the Hrodna
regional executive committee. On July 15, Ms. Reviaka sent a petition to
request a copy of the examination order, as well as information about the
qualifications of the expert, including his or her level of education, degree,
professional experience and previous experience of conducting similar
examinations, invoking Article 138 of the Customs Code of the Customs Union,
according to which “a customs examination shall be appointed by the customs
authorities and carried out by customs experts as well as experts from other
authorised organisations”, while the expert may be a person who “possesses the
necessary expertise to give expert opinion”. 
 
In
his response to the request, dated July 22, 2013, the Acting Director of the
Ashmiany Customs Department Mr. Siarhei Samushchau alleged that the Ashmiany
customs did not know who would conduct the examination, while the decision on
the appointment of the examination had mentioned the name of P.K. Skarabko. Ms.
Tatsiana Reviaka therefore sent another petition to reiterate her previous
demands about the qualifications of Mr. P.K. Skarabko. This was followed by
another vague answer which completely ignored her request.
 
On
August 14, 2013, Ms. Reviaka expressed concerns to the State Customs Committee
that 33 days after the appointment of the examination (i.e. from July 5 to
August 7, 2013), the head of the Ashmiany Customs Department was still unaware
of the expert’s name, although Part. 2 of Article 139 of the Customs Code
provides that the period of an examination may not exceed 20 working days from
the date of submission of the expert materials, and that such materials should
be passed to the expert during the same working day.
 
However,
on September 9, 2013, the State Customs Committee replied that the examination
had “started on July 24, 2013” and had in reality been “completed on July 30,
2013”.
 
The Observatory
expresses its concern about the confiscation of the copies of Mr. Bialiatski's
book on biased grounds and about the series of procedural irregularities that
ensued, and considers it as a means to further sanction his human rights
activities.
 
Actions requested:
 
Please
write to the Belarusian authorities, urging them to :
 
i. Cancel the examination order and return the
confiscated books written by Mr. Bialiatski to Ms. Reviaka;

strive for the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental
freedoms at the national and international levels”,

discuss, form and hold opinions on the observance, both in law and in practice,
of all human rights and fundamental freedoms and, through these and other
appropriate means, to draw public attention to those matters”.
- and its Article 12.2, which provides that “the
State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the
competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others,
against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse
discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his

Declaration” ;
