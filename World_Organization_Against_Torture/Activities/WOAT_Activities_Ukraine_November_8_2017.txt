Stop Persecution of Anti-corruption
Activists
Open Letter to the Ukrainian Authorities


7 November
2017
We, members of the NGO coalition the Civic Solidarity
Platform (CSP) and other NGOs across Europe and the United States, express
serious concern about harassment and persecution of anti-corruption activists
in Ukraine, including restrictive legislation requiring activists to disclose
personnel assets, criminal investigations and smear campaigns
against well-known anti-corruption organisations and activists, as well as physical
attacks against individuals and a lack of effective investigations in such
cases. We call upon the Ukrainian authorities to immediately
take all necessary measures to reverse these highly disturbing
developments.  

E-declarations for anti-corruption activists
On 27 March 2017, following approval by the
Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, President Poroshenko signed Law No. 6172, amending
Ukraine’s existing law “On Countering Corruption.” The amendments oblige anti-corruption
activists to submit public electronic declarations of property status (е-declarations),
despite the fact they are not receiving public money. Previously this
requirement only applied to the highest state offi­cials, MPs, public servants
and judges. Moreover, individuals who provide any services to an
“anti-corruption civic or­ganization”, are re­quired to fill e-declarations. 
The process of filling out e-declarations
is long and cumbersome; therefore, the amendments may restrict the ability of
civil society organisations to operate, by exerting an unnecessary bureaucratic
burden on their work. According to the law activists and others who do not file
asset declarations would face criminal charges and up to two years in prison.
Due to the vagueness of the law’s wording, it could be arbitrarily applied to
harass specific individuals. Since the Law’s adoption, it has had a
restraining, discouraging ef­fect on civil society working in the area of
countering corruption.[1]
Criminal investigations and smear campaigns
We
are concerned by a series of recent criminal proceedings against
non-governmental organisations and civil society activists on fabricated or
improper charges. For instance, on 11 October 2017 the National Police of
Ukraine and the Prosecutor General’s Office of Ukraine raided the office of the
Charitable Fund "Patients of Ukraine" and seized the fund’s
documents. The leadership of the Fund together with two other organisations,
the All-Ukrainian Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS and the Alliance for
Public Health, have been accused of alleged misappropriation of funds provided
by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and financing the
so-called “Luhansk People’s Republic” and “Donetsk People’s Republic”. Audits
by the Global Fund itself have never shown misappropriation. The three
organisations are famous for their long term fight against corruption in the
healthcare sector.[2] 
In
August 2017, the Investigation Department of the Fiscal Service of Kyiv
instituted criminal proceedings against the heads of the Anti-Corruption Action
Centre.[3]
Anti-corruption activists believe that information collected during the
investigation (for instance via surveillance) will later be used in a smear
campaign against them. Defamatory materials have already been published to
discredit the members of the Anti-Corruption Action Centre, Vitaliy Shabunin and
Oleksandra Ustinova. 
Physical attacks and lack of effective investigations
We
are deeply concerned by two recent attacks on Evhen Lisichkin and Dmytro
Bulakh, anti-corruption activists from Kharkiv. On 18 September 2017,
Lisichkin, an activist from Kharkiv
Anticorruption Center and head of the Democratic Alliance in Kharkiv, was
attacked near his house and beaten up by two men who threatened to kill him for
his civil activism. Lisichkin was diagnosed with brain concussion and other
less severe injuries.[4]
Two weeks earlier, on 30 August 2017, Dmytro Bulakh, a head of the
Kharkiv Anticorruption Center, was brutally beaten up.[5]
According to media reports, the police began investigating the crime. However,
the preliminary categorisation of the attack as “hooliganism” raises concerns
as it does not take into account Bulakh’s civic activity and work and the
possible motive behind the attack. In June 2017, Vitaliy Shabunin
was sprayed with pepper spray at the Dniprovskyi District Military Enlistment
Office.[6]
Anti-corruption
activists contribute to observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms and
act in the interest of the whole of society. They are exposed to heightened
risks of attacks or harassment due to the specific issues they are working on, as
they often reveal to the public information on unlawful activities and
corruption by state authorities and officials. 
The
UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders noted that
“human rights defenders addressing environmental and land issues and corporate
responsibility, as well as those working on 
governance issues, promoting transparency and accountability, and those exposing
discrimination, corruption and violence at the hands of States, business
enterprises and other non-State actors, are among those human rights defenders
who are most exposed and at risk”.[7]

The
state has an obligation to provide protection and an effective remedy for
persons who have been victims of a human rights violation. The state has also a
duty to conduct prompt and impartial investigations of alleged violations of
human defenders’ rights, including anti-corruption activists. Ukraine has
obliged to uphold these standards as a signatory of the International Covenant
on Civil and Political Rights, as well as a member of the Organisation for
Cooperation and Security in Europe (OSCE) as well as the Council of Europe.[8]
We call upon the Ukrainian authorities to: 
·    Immediately
stop prosecutions against anti-corruption activists on fabricated or improper
charges, and to refrain from further prosecution; 
·      
Openly
condemn smear campaigns and physical attacks against anti-corruption activists and
organisations working on anti-corruption issues; 
·      
Undertake
prompt, effective and impartial investigations into the physical violence
against anti-corruption activists and ensure that the perpetrators are brought
to justice. Take all necessary measures to prevent such attacks in the future;  
·      
Amend
legislative provisions on e-declarations so they do not impede or disable civil
society activities aimed at fighting corruption, including ensure that the
penalty of loss of the non-profit status is not included in any future
legislation on NGOs.
