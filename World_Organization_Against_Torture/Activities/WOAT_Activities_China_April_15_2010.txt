Arbitrary arrest and detention/ Risk of torture and ill-treatment/ Fear for the safety

The International Secretariat of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) requests your URGENT intervention in the following situation in the People’s Republic of China.
Brief description of the situation
The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by The Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy (TCHRD), a member of OMCT SOS-Torture Network, about the arbitrary arrest and detention of Mr. Abo Tashi, a 22-year-old Tibetan monk from Guru Monastery in Kardze Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture (TAP) in Sichuan Province. OMCT fears that he may be at risk of torture and ill-treatment.
According to the information received, on 8 April 2010, Mr. Abo Tashi was arrested by Chinese Public Security Bureau (PSB) officials for participating and taking pictures during a protest rally that he staged with three friends in Nyarong County main market. The four individuals reportedly carried the banned Tibetan national flag, chanted slogans and thrown handwritten pamphlets demanding for the quick return of the Dalai Lama to Tibet, the independence for Tibet and the suspension of the mining activities in the Nyarong region. Mr. Abo Tashi’s three friends reportedly managed to flee from the scene.
The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned about the safety of Mr. Abo Tashi, particularly because his exact whereabouts could not be ascertained, and recalls to the competent Chinese authorities that China is legally bound to effectively ensure the physical and psychological integrity of all persons deprived of liberty in accordance with international human rights law, and in particular, the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.
As stated by the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in his latest report, “detainees are under a particularly high risk of being tortured when held in police custody (…). In order to keep this critical phase as short as possible, international human rights law requires that any person arrested or detained on the suspicion of having committed a crime has to be brought “promptly” before a judge or another officer authorized by law to exercise judicial powers” (§88 A/HRC/13/39/Add.5).
OMCT is also seriously preoccupied about his arrest, as it appears to be solely based on his peaceful political and religious beliefs and the exercise of his right to freedom of expression. OMCT calls on the competent authorities to order his immediate release in the absence of valid legal charges that are consistent with international law and standards, or, if such charges exist, bring him promptly before an impartial, independent and competent tribunal and guarantee his procedural rights at all times, including immediate and unconditional access to a lawyer of his choice.
Finally, OMCT urges the authorities to conform with China’s international human rights obligations, commitments that were reaffirmed on the occasion of its election as a member of the United Nations Human Rights Council.
