The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint 
programme of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and the International 
Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), requests your urgent intervention in the 
following situation in the Russian Federation.
 
Description of the situation:
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the 
attack against Mr. Alexey Dmitriev, a lawyer by education and a supporter of the Campaign 
for the Defence of the Khimki Forestin the 
Moscow region, in the framework of plans to build a highway connecting Moscow to 
Saint Petersburg that would go through the forest.
 
According to the information received, on April 16, 2012, at around 
8.30 am, Mr. Alexey Dmitriev was attacked by unknown attackers as he was standing at the lift outside his flat to go to work in the morning, and was subjected to brutal 
beating. Mr. Dmitriev lost conscience almost immediately and neighbours called an ambulance for him and helped him to get into his 
flat. Mr. Dmitriev's mobile phone and camera, which contained a lot of pictures 
he had taken at sites of felling, were stolen. When taken to the hospital, Mr. Dmitriev was diagnosed with head 
concussion, lacerated wounds on the head and broken nose. The police, who were 
called simultaneously with the ambulance, arrived on the spot about two hours 
after the beating took place.
 
A week before the attack, Mr. Dmitriev had led a public environmental inspection to the site of the destruction 
of the Klyaz’ma river for the Moscow - Saint Petersburg toll motorway. 
Subsequently, he published a report denouncing the destruction of the forest by 
the French company Vinci and its Russian partners[1]. Moreover, he 
was to due participate this week in two trials to consider suits he has 
initiated against one developing company and the Khimki town municipality, which 
permitted the construction of a parking lot in the middle of the park. The last 
post in his LiveJournal blog was on the flooding in Druzhba street in Khimki 
town, caused by numerous infringements of the construction regulations while 
building a multi-storied apartment building.

 
On April 17, 2012, Mr. Alexey Dmitriev lodged a complaint and a criminal case was opened. Yet, the police 
almost immediately started to claim that the attack was a mere robbery without 
any political motivations. As of issuing this Urgent Appeal, Mr. Dmitriev remains in the surgical department of the Khimki 
hospital.
 
The Observatory strongly condemns this assault, and fears that it 
aims at sanctioning Mr. Alexey Dmitriev's human rights activities, and more particularly his involvement 
in the ecological movement defending the Khimki forest. In particular, 
 
the Observatory recalls that other environmental activists were 
arbitrarily detained or harassed over the past for struggling in favour of the 
preservation of the Khimki forest[2]. On April 16, 
2012, Ms. Evgenia Chirikova, Coordinator of the Campaign for the Defence of 
the Khimki Forest, was awarded the Goldman Environmental Prize 2012 for the protection of the Khimki 
forest.
