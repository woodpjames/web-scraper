The International Secretariat of OMCT has received new information regarding the following situation in Democratic Republic of Congo.  New Information  The International Secretariat of OMCT has just learnt that Mgr Emmanuel Kataliko has returned to Bukavu after seven months in Butembo (North-Kivu).  During these 7 months, he was placed under house arrest by the RCD authorities.  Brief reminder of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT was informed by a reliable source of the arrest and disappearance of Archbishop Kataliko in Democratic Republic of Congo.  According to the information received, Archbishop Kataliko was arrested on Saturday 12th February as he returned from an Episcopal Conference in Kinshasa, via Nairobi, Kampala and Goma.  His flight landed in Goma at 10:20 am.  Mgr. Kataliko, who had an onward journey to Bukavu was restrained as he descended from the plane by five RCD soldiers.   The reason for his arrest was believed to be the content of a Christmas message in 1999.  According to further information, following this, he was advised by the RCD authorities to "stay where he was" and declared a "persona non grata".  The International Secretariat was gravely concerned by these events and for the physical and psychological integrity of Mgr. Kataliko, particularly in light of the murder of his predecessor, Mgr. Muzihirwa, brutally killed and his body found half-naked on a public highway.  Remarks  The International Secretariat of OMCT wishes to thank all those institutions, organizations and individuals who intervened on his behalf.  Geneva, 15th September 2000
