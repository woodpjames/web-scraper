Mr. Osanloo has been arbitrarily detained since July 10, 2007 at the prison of Evin, in Tehran. According to the information received, a doctor at the prison had recently warned that Mr. Osanloo could become blind without an appropriate treatment.  The Observatory fears for Mr. Osanloo’s physical and psychological integrity and considers his detention to be arbitrary as it merely aims at sanctioning his involvement in favour of economic and social rights in Iran. The Observatory recalls that Mr. Osanloo has been subjected to many violations of his rights in the past, including violence and arbitrary detentions, in reason of his activities as a trade union leader in Iran (See Annual Reports 2005 and 2006 of the Observatory).  Background information:  Mr. Mansour Osanloo was abducted on July 10, 2007 by unidentified assailants as he was leaving a public bus near his home. According to witnesses, Mr. Osanloo’s assailants beat him severely, and took him away in a metallic grey Peugeot to an undisclosed location. Mr. Osanloo had apparently been followed all day by the unmarked Peugeot car. Such vehicles are well known as being associated with the Iranian Security Forces.  On July 12, 2007, Mr. Osanloo’s arrest was acknowledged by the Revolutionary Prosecutor Mortazavi. Since then, Mr. Osanloo was reportedly charged with “conspiring against national security”.  On September 3, 2007, the wife of Mr. Mansour Osanloo, Ms. Parvaneh Osanloo, and his sister were briefly arrested in Tehran after they attempted to meet with Ms. Louise Arbour, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, who was at the time visiting Iran.   Actions requested:  Please write to the authorities in Iran urging them to:   Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Mansour Osanloo as well as of his relatives, and ensure that he be provided with urgent medical assistance; Release Mr. Mansour Osanloo immediately and unconditionally as his detention is arbitrary; Ensure that he be granted a fair and impartial trial in the soonest delay so that the charges against him be dropped as they merely sanction his human rights activities; Put an end to all acts of harassment against all Iranian human rights defenders; Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, and Article 12.2, which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”; More generally, ensure in all circumstances the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with international and regional human rights instruments ratified by Iran.
