Dear members of the IAP Executive Committee and the Senate, 
dear members of the IAP,
 
 
In the run-up to the annual conference and general meeting of the
International Association of Prosecutors (IAP) in Beijing, China, the undersigned
civil society organisations urge the IAP to live up to its vision and bolster
its efforts to preserve the integrity of the profession.
 
Increasingly, in many regions of the world, in clear breach of
professional integrity and fair trial standards, public prosecutors use their
powers to suppress critical voices. 
 
In China, over the last two years, dozens of prominent lawyers, labour
rights advocates and activists have been targeted by the prosecution service[1].
Many remain behind bars, convicted or in prolonged detention for legal and
peaceful activities protected by international human rights standards, including
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Azerbaijan is in the midst of a
major crackdown on civil rights defenders, bloggers and journalists, imposing
hefty sentences on fabricated charges in trials that make a mockery of justice[2].
In Kazakhstan, Russia and Turkey many prosecutors play an active role in the repression
of human rights defenders, and in committing, covering up or condoning other
grave human rights abuses[3].
 
Patterns of abusive practices by prosecutors in these and other
countries ought to be of grave concern to the professional associations they
belong to, such as the IAP. Upholding the rule of law and human rights is a key
aspect of the profession of a prosecutor, as is certified by the IAP’s Standards of Professional Responsibility and
Statement of the Essential Duties and Rights of Prosecutors, that explicitly
refer to the importance of observing and protecting the right to a fair trial
and other human rights at all stages of work[4].

 
Maintaining the credibility of the
profession should be a key concern for the IAP. This requires explicit steps by
the IAP to introduce a meaningful human rights policy. Such steps will help to counter
devaluation of ethical standards in the profession, revamp public trust in
justice professionals and protect the organisation and its members from
damaging reputational impact and allegations of whitewashing or complicity in
human rights abuses. 
 
For the second year in
a row, civil society appeals to the IAP to honour its human rights responsibilities
by introducing a tangible human rights policy. In particular:
 
We urge the IAP Executive Committee and the Senate to:
 
-       
introduce
human rights due diligence and compliance procedures for new and current members,
including scope for complaint mechanisms with respect to institutional and
individual members, making information public about its institutional members
and creating openings for stakeholder engagement from the side of civil society
and victims of human rights abuses[5].
We call on individual members of the IAP to:
 
-       
raise
the problem of a lack of human rights compliance mechanisms at the IAP and thoroughly discuss the human rights implications before
making decisions about hosting IAP meetings; 
 
-       
identify
relevant human rights concerns before travelling to IAP conferences and
meetings and raise these issues with their counterparts from countries where
politically-motivated prosecution and human rights abuses by prosecution
authorities are reported by intergovernmental organisations and internationally
renowned human rights groups.
