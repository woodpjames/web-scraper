Brief description of the situation: The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the grenade attack on the residence of Mr. J.C. Weliamuna, a human rights lawyer and Executive Director of the Sri Lanka chapter of Transparency International. According to the information received, on September 27, 2008, at 11.40 pm, an unidentified gang lobbed two hand grenades at the residence of Mr. J.C Weliamuna, which is close to a police station (Kohuwela), and an army camp (Kohuwela-Pepiliyana road). Although damage was caused to property, fortunately no bodily harm was caused to Mr. Weliamuna or members of his family. The Observatory strongly condemns the grenade attack on Mr. Weliamuna’s residence, and believes it is aimed at preventing him from carrying out his human rights activities. As a matter of fact, Mr. Weliamuna has appeared in highly sensitive cases involving corruption and human rights violations, including pending cases involving Government officials and members of the police force. On the very day of the attack, Mr. Weliamuna had moved a motion at the Bar Council regarding a lawyer who had received death threats due to his appearance in an extra-judicial killing case. The victim of the killing had previously brought two complaint against police officers, for bribery and torture. The Bar Council unanimously decided to act on the complaint of the lawyer and condemned this interference with the work of lawyers and resolved to pursue the matter with the Inspector General of Police and other competent authorities. The Observatory expresses its deep concern about the grenade attack on Mr. Weliamuna’s residence, which illustrates once more the situation of extreme insecurity faced by human rights defenders in Sri Lanka, especially since the intensification of the conflict in July 2006 and the end of the 2002 ceasefire agreement between the Government and the LTTE, which was called of on January 2, 2008 by the Government. Actions requested: Please write to the authorities of Sri Lanka asking them to:   Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. J.C. Weliamuna as well as of all Sri Lankan human rights defenders;  Order a thorough and impartial investigation into the grenade attack on Mr. Weliamuna’s residence, in order to identify all those responsible, bring them before an ordinary competent and impartial tribunal and apply to them the penal sanctions provided by the law;  Put an end to all acts of harassment against human rights defenders and humanitarian workers in Sri Lanka;  Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, and Article 12.2, which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”;  Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.
