The International
Secretariat of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) requestsyour
URGENTintervention in
the following situation in India/ West Bengal.
Brief description of the situation  
The International Secretariat of OMCT has been
informed by Banglar Manabadhikar
Suraksha Mancha (MASUM),a member of OMCT SOS-Torture Network, about
the alleged attempted killing and the severe beatings suffered by Mr. Setarul Sk., about 30 years old from
Jayrampur village, in Murshidabad, West Bengal, by Border Security Force (BSF) constables, Nimtita.  
According to the information received, on 10
 September 2010 at
about 7:30 pm,
Mr. Setarul Sk., who was heading to meet a relative living in Parsujapur
(located on the other side of the Ganga River), was severely beaten by four BSF
constables. Mr. Setarul Sk. was reportedly on a boat crossing the river when
the BSF constables approached on a speedboat near Arjunpur Jetty, captured him
without giving a reason and allegedly started to severely beat him, including
with bamboo sticks. One of the BSF constables also hit him on his right leg
with a bayonet causing a serious injury. The BSF constables then reportedly
seized the boat, took Mr. Setarul Sk. along with them and after reaching the Padma River, near the Indo-Bangladesh border, threw
him into the river. 
According to the same information, Mr. Setarul Sk.
managed to reach the bank of the river near Sahapara village, which is located
in Bangladesh, where he was treated by a doctor, before he returned
home on 12 September 2010. Due to the injuries sustained, Mr. Setarul Sk. was
admitted in Mahalpahari Christian Hospital and later received medical treatment at
Lansdown Nursing Home in Kolkata. However, Mr. Setarul Sk. was unable to
continue his treatment because of lack of money. 
It is reported that Mr. Setarul Sk. lodged written
complaints against the alleged BSF constables before the Murshidabad District
Magistrate and the Murshidabad Superintendent of Police on 18
 October 2010. However, to this
date, there has been reportedly no effective investigation into the alleged
facts. 
The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely
concerned about the alleged aforementioned facts and recalls that the authorities have to fulfil their obligations under international
human rights law to protect the right to life and the right not to be subjected
to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and to
bringing to justice those responsible for violating these rights.
OMCT is also deeply concerned by the delays in
initiating an investigation into these allegations and fears that the
perpetrators may again enjoy impunity. Accordingly, OMCT calls on the competent
authorities to carry out a prompt, effective, thorough, independent and impartial investigation into these
events the result of which must be made public, in orderto bring those responsible before a competent, independent and
impartial tribunal and apply penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions as
provided by law. Actions requestedPlease write to the
authorities in India/ West Bengal urging them to:
Guarantee, in all
circumstances, the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Setarul Sk.;Carry out a
prompt, effective, thorough, independent and impartial investigation into these events, the result of which must be
made public, in orderto bring those
responsible before a competent, independent and impartial tribunal and apply
penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions as provided by law;Ensure
that an effective remedy as well as the right to full redress, including
compensation and rehabilitation, is granted to the victim concerned; Guarantee
the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country
in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
