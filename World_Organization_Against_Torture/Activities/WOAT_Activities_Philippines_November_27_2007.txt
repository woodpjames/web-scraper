In both Kenya and the Philippines, conflict and lack of security expose citizens to situations that severely impede their possibility of escaping from poverty, of working in just and favourable conditions, of providing care and education to their children and of enjoying an adequate standard of living and the highest attainable standard of health. OMCT recognises that the social, economic and cultural root causes of violence is an issue that the Committee has been concerned with for many years, and our objective in compiling these lists of issues is to contribute to the preparation of practical recommendations that can be both implemented and monitored.
