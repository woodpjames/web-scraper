Arbitrary detention /Judicial harassment
Cameroon
May 30, 2018
 
The Observatory for the
Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a partnership of World Organisation
Against Torture (OMCT) and FIDH, has received new information and requests your
urgent intervention in the following situation in Cameroon. 
 
New information:

The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources
about the ongoing judicial harassment and arbitrary detention of Mr. Musa
Usman Ndamba, National Vice President of the Mbororo Social and Cultural
Development Association (MBOSCUDA), an organisation that defends indigenous
Mbororo rights 

[1]. 
According to the information
received, on May 29, 2018, the hearing concerning Mr. Musa Usman Ndamba’s bail
application was adjourned to June 5, 2018, upon request of the lawyers of the
plaintiff, Mr. Baba Ahmadou Danpullo[2], who applied to act as civil party in the proceedings and claimed
delays in Mr. Ndamba’s lawyers response to their application. 
 
Mr. Musa Usman Ndamba had been sentenced on May 11, 2018, to six months
in prison and a fine of 500’000 FCFA (approximatively 760 Euros) on charges of “defamation of character”,
under section 305(1) of the Criminal Code of Cameroon[3]. The sentence came after
60 hearings and seven years of continuous judicial harassment, and at the end
of a proceeding characterised by continuous violations of Mr. Ndamba’s right to
fair trial (see background information). Mr. Musa Usman Ndamba is currently
detained at Bamenda Central Prison in the North-West Region.
 
The Observatory strongly condemns the
continuous judicial harassment against Mr. Ndamba, which is a further evidence
of the judiciary power’s complicity with Mr. Danpullo’s strategy to keep Mr.
Ndamba in prison in order to hinder his peaceful and legitimate human rights
activities, in particular as
MBOSCUDA’s National Vice President. 
 
Moreover, these acts of harassment are not
isolated, as the Observatory has reported several cases of judicial harassment
against leaders of civil society organisations denouncing the government’s
corruption and opposing land grabbing in Cameroon. Many of these acts are
linked to cases of land acquisition by Mr. Baba Ahmadou Danpullo[4]. 
 

Background information: 

In 2011, Mr. Musa Usman Ndamba was put under investigation by the police,
following a complaint brought by Mr. Baba Ahmadou Danpullo for “propagating
false information liable to injure public authorities”, “being a party in a
judicial proceeding on oath and making false declarations”, “making a false
report against Baba Ahmadou Danpullo liable to lead to his prosecution” and
“injuring the reputation of Baba Ahmadou Danpullo by imputation of unprovable
facts”. However, the alleged defamatory statements contained in the
affidavit on the basis of which Mr. Ndamba was condemned were not signed by him
but by another individual named Mr. Musa Adamu. 
 
On May 10, 2013, Mr. Musa
Usman Ndamba was summoned to appear before the Court of First Instance in
Bamenda, North Western Cameroon, in relation to these charges. During the
hearing, Mr. Ndamba refuted all the allegations and pleaded not guilty. Mr.
Ndamba was bailed, pending another hearing scheduled on May 27, 2013. On that
day, as the landowner failed to appear in court, the matter was adjourned to
June 28, 2013, and the judge warned that he would award costs against the
landowner should he fail again to attend court. Subsequently, in May 2014 the
court dismissed the charges against Mr. Ndamba for lack of a diligent prosecution. 
 
On July 29, 2016, Mr. Baba Ahmadou Danpullo reinstated the same case, accusing Mr.
Ndamba of “propagation of false information, false oath, false report and
defamation of character” based on the same affidavit and evidence as the case
in 2013. Subsequently, the trial was adjourned several times in absence of the
plaintiff. 
 
On December 18, 2017, the
trial of Mr. Ndamba was adjourned for the fifty-fifth time.
 
On February 23, 2018, the
trial against Mr. Musa Usman Ndamba was resumed for the 57th time.
The plaintiff Mr. Baba Ahmadou
Danpullo was not present at
the hearing and was represented by Mr. Sama Francis Asanga, a senior official from the opposition Social
Democratic Party (SDF), close family member of the party leader Mr. John Fru
Ndi and former President of the Cameroon Bar Association. On March 2, 2018, the Bamenda Court of
First Instance presided by Magistrate Justine Babila Tebid adjourned the next
hearing to March 16, 2018.
 
 
On March 16, 2018, the trial was adjourned to
April 6, 2018, because of the absence of the plaintiff’s witnesses. 
 
On April 6, 2018, the trial went ahead with one
of the plaintiff’s witnesses Buba Wajiri also known as Mallam Gajere and was
adjourned again to April 13, 2018.
 
On April 13, 2018, Mr. Baba Ahmadou Danpullo,
was not present at the hearing and was represented by Mr. Sama Francis Asanga,
a senior SDF official, close family member of the party leader Mr John Fru Ndi
and former President of the Cameroon Bar Association. 
On April 27, 2018, Barrister Joseph Akong, who notarised the affidavit in May 2013,
testified that Mr. Ndamba was not the person for whom he notarised the
affidavit, and that he had only met Mr. Ndamba during the preliminary
investigation of the case. He also stated that he would be able to produce Mr. Musa Adamu in court.
 
On May 11, 2018, Mr. Musa Usman Ndamba was sentenced to 6 months in
prison and a fine of 500’000 FCFA (approximatively 760 Euros) on charges of “defamation of character”,
under section 305(1) of the Criminal Code of Cameroon. Furthermore, he was
condemned to pay an additional sum of 500’000 FCFA as civil award to Mr. Baba Ahmadou Danpullo. Following the sentence, Mr. Musa Usman Ndamba
was transferred to Bamenda Central Prison in the North-West Region and appealed
the decision.
