See http://www.defendingwomen-defendingrights.org/resources.php.   The Consultation participants declared 29 November as the International Day on WHRDs to be celebrated as part of the 16 Days of Activism.   We invite everyone to celebrate this day with us to raise awareness and to acknowledge the work that women are doing to defend human rights worldwide and that both women and men are doing to protect women's rights in spite of the great challenges they face.   In the framework of the 1st International Day on WHRDs, we are calling on the States of the European Union to ensure that a gender perspective is included in the efforts to implement the EU Guidelines on Human Rights Defenders. Gender-specific recommendations for the EU Guidelines as well as a circular on lobbying possibilities on the issue are available in English, French, Spanish, Russian, Chinese and Arabic.
