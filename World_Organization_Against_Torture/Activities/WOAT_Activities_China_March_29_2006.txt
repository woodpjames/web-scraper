Brief Description of the SituationThe International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by a reliable source about the sentencing of Mr. Ren Zhiyuan on 17 March 2006 to 10 years imprisonment for “subversion of state power” on the basis of an article posted on the Internet. It is reported that Shandong Jining Procuratorate issued the formal charge.   According to the information received, on 28 April 2005, Mr. Ren departed on a trip to Wuhan, Shanghai and Jiangsu Province. Although he was only formally arrested on 17 June 2005, he was already detained on 10 May 2005 in Nantong, Jiangsu Province. Reason for the detention is an essay disseminated on the Internet called “The Road to Democracy” (Minzhu zhi lu), in which he expressed the opinion that the people have the right to overthrow tyranny by violent means. Mr. Ren was also suspected of drawing up plans to establish an organisation called “Mainland Democracy Frontline”.  On 30 September 2005, Mr. Ren was tried for subversion at the Jining Municipal Intermediate People’s Court, at which time his defence attorney, Mr. Zhang Chengmao, submitted a “not guilty” plea. On 15 March 2006, the Jining National Defence Unit notified Mr. Zhang and Mr. Ren’s father that the court would deliver its judgment on 17 March 2006.  The International Secretariat of OMCT calls for the immediate release of Mr. Ren Zhiyuan and all others arbitrarily detained in the People’s Republic of China.  Actions Requested:Please write to the Chinese authorities urging them to: i.	Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Ren Zhiyuan; ii.	Release immediately Mr. Ren Zhiyuan since his detention is arbitrary; iii.	Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by the People’s Republic of China.
