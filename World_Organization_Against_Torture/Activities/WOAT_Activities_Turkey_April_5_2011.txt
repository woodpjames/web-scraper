The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), has received new information and requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in Turkey.
 
New information:
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the release of Ms. Vetha Aydın, President of the Siirt branch of the Human Rights Association (İnsan Haklari Derneği - İHD), as well as about the ongoing judicial harassment against her. 
 
According to the information received, on March 15, 2011, Ms. Vetha Aydın was released under order of the 4th High Criminal Court of Diyarbakır for lack of evidence. Ms. Vetha Aydın was arrested on March 16, 2010, for her alleged membership to the Kurdistan Communities Union (Koma Civakên Kurdistan - KCK). However, charges of “membership to an illegal organisation” pursuant to Article 314.2 of the Criminal Code, with reference to Article 220/6 of the Criminal Code in the Law No. 5237 and Articles 2 and 5 of the Law to Fight Terrorism (Law 3713), are still pending against her. The next hearing will take place on May 26, 2011.
 
The Observatory welcomes the release of Ms. Vetha Aydın and thanks all the persons, institutions and organisations who intervened in her favour. However, the Observatory remains deeply concerned by the fact that charges remain pending against her and seem merely to aim at sanctioning her human rights activities.
 
Background information:
 
On March 16, 2010, Ms. Vetha Aydın and Mr. Abdullah Gürgen, Board Member of İHD Siirt branch, were arbitrarily arrested at their houses in Siirt by the Anti-Terror Unit of the police who were in possession of a warrant from the Diyarbakır Special Prosecution, as part of the ongoing anti-terror operation in Turkey (in the framework of the so-called “war on terrorism”). The exact charges brought against them were unknown at that moment. They were detained at the police headquarters in Siirt.
 
On March 17, 2010, Mr. Abdullah Gürgen was released from the Siirt police headquarters. He was later charged with “membership to an illegal organisation”. However, Ms. Vetha Aydın remained detained at the police headquarters in Siirt.
 
After the arrest, on March 16 in the morning, the police raided the offices of IHD Siirt branch. They searched for information concerning the activities of the association and its members. The police filmed with a camera all of the membership registration forms and confiscated some of the association's hard disk, files and CDs. They also confiscated some letters sent by prisoners regarding to human rights violations faced in detention. All the material and equipment confiscated was later returned after the authorities had made a copy.
 
Accordingly, the Observatory calls upon the Turkish authorities to put an end to the continuing harassment - including at the judicial level - against Ms. Vetha Aydın and Mr. Abdullah Gürgen, as well as against all members of İHD.
