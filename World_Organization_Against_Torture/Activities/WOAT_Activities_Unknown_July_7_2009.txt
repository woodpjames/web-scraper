Brief description of the situation: The Observatory has been informed by the Iranian League for the Defence of Human Rights (LDDHI) of the arbitrary arrest of Ms. Zeynab Peyquambarzardeh, a young student and an active member of the women's rights movement. According to the information received, on July 4, 2009, Ms. Zeynab Peyquambarzadeh was arrested by security forces in Park Laleh in Tehran while she was participating in a peaceful protest with families of political prisoners calling for the release of peaceful protesters who were arrested after the election. As of issuing this urgent appeal, no information could be obtained regarding her whereabouts. The Observatory expresses its deep concern about Ms. Zeynab Peyquambarzadeh’s arbitrary detention, all the more as it takes place in the context of the current general crackdown on the Iranian civil society[1]. The Observatory calls upon the Iranian authorities to immediately and unconditionally release Ms. Zeynab Peyquambarzadeh and all human rights defenders presently detained in Iran, and more generally to put an end to all forms of harassment against them. Background information: The Observatory recalls that Ms. Zeynab Peyqambarzadeh had already been arrested in Tehran on March 4, 2007, along with 32 other women rights activities, while peacefully demonstrating in front of the Tehran Revolutionary Court to mark International Women’s Day, on March 8, 2007. They were also protesting against the trials of six women human rights defenders who were prosecuted in connection with their participation in a peaceful gathering on June 12, 2006, and with their involvement in the One Million Signatures Campaign. Ms. Peyqambarzadeh had been subsequently released on bail. In addition, Ms. Peyqambarzadeh had again been detained at the Evin prison from May 7 to May 16, 2007, without being given the reasons for her arrest. On May 16, 2007, she had been released on bail after paying 20 million toman (around 16,000 euros), a sum collected thanks to a movement of solidarity[2]. Actions requested: Please write to the Iranian authorities and ask them to:   Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Ms. Zeynab Peyquambarzadeh and all human rights defenders in Iran;  Disclose Ms. Zeynab Peyquambarzadeh’s whereabouts and release her immediately and unconditionally since her detention is arbitrary as it seems to merely aim at sanctioning their human rights activities;  Put an end to acts of harassment against all human rights defenders in Iran;  Conform in any circumstances with the provisions of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted on December 9, 1998 by the United Nations General Assembly, in particular its article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually or in association with others, to promote the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, its article 5(c), which reads that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, at the national and international levels, [...] to communicate with non-governmental or intergovernmental organizations”, and its article 12.2 which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”;  Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by Iran.
