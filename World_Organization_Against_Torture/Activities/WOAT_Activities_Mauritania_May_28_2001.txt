Description of the facts :  Moussa Maïga, a member of the Mali Bar and of the Malian Human Rights Association (AMDH), sent as an FIDH observer to the trial of Mr. Chbih Cheikh Ould Malaïnine, leader of the Mauritanian Popular Front (FPM) was refused entry to Mauritanian territory on his arrival at Nouakchott airport on Sunday 27th May. Mr. Chbih Cheikh Ould Malaïnine is being prosecuted for "adherence to a criminal association" and his trial opens this Monday 28 May 2001 before the Criminal Court of the town of Aioun, 800 km from the capital.  Mr. Maïga was not given any written notification of this ban on entry to the country; he was merely informed that clear instructions had been received that he was to be turned back before passing the police check point.  This treatment of Mr. Moussa Maïga is in blatant contradiction with the Declaration on human rights defenders adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 9 December 1998, in particular with Article 9.3b which states that "In the exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the promotion and protection of human rights as referred to in the present Declaration, everyone has the right individually and in association with others, to attend public hearings, proceedings and trials so as to form an opinion on their compliance with national law and applicable international obligations and commitments".   The Observatory condemns the measure taken against Moussa Maïga, aimed at hindering the activity of human rights defenders.  Action requested :  Kindly write to the Mauritanian authorities requesting them :  i.	to apply the principles and international standards with respect to human rights, including the terms of the Declaration on human rights defenders adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 9 December 1998, in particular Article 1 which states that "Everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels" and Article 9.3b quoted above;  ii.	to comply generally with the terms of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights which guarantees freedom of movement and security of all citizens, and with regional and international protocols ratified by Mauritania.
