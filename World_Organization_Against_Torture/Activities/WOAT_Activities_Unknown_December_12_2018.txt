Save as PDF Print versionHuman rights defenders / Statements / 2018 / DecemberShrinking space for civil society in the OSCE hits a new low at the Ministerial Council Meeting in Milano ​Statement by the Coordination Committee of the Civic Solidarity PlatformThe Civic Solidarity
 Platform, of which OMCT is member organisation, is a coalition of 50 human rights NGOs from Europe, Eurasia 
and the US aimed at serving as a conduit through which civic activists 
can build alliances, strengthen mutual support and solidarity​We, members of the Coordination Committee of the Civic Solidarity Platform (CSP)
 and other civil society representatives, are shocked by the exclusion 
of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) from attending the opening and 
closing sessions of the OSCE Ministerial Council Meeting (MC) in the 
plenary hall as well as not being provided with an opportunity to follow
 the live broadcast of proceedings or to hold side events in Milano on 6
 and 7 December 2018.
For the first time ever, civil society representatives were refused 
physical access to the opening and closing sessions of the OSCE MC in 
the plenary hall, in break with previous practice and in contradiction 
to the Rules of Procedure of the OSCE which say that “[o]nly the 
opening and closing sessions shall be open to the press and the public, 
unless the meeting decides to make other sessions open.” [1] While media representatives had access to the opening and closing sessions in the plenary hall, NGO representatives did not.
Although NGOs were provided with their own working and meeting space,
 the space was without visual and audio equipment to allow them to 
follow the MC proceedings, also in direct contradiction to the OSCE 
Rules of Procedure. [2] The space provided for NGOs was secluded and 
therefore did not allow for any meaningful exchange with MC 
participants.
Furthermore, after inquiring of the Italian OSCE Chairmanship weeks 
ago about the possibility of organising and/ or contributing to side 
events, the Civic Solidarity Platform was informed that this year there 
would be no side events, only to learn once in Milano that many side 
events were in fact scheduled without NGO participation. This clearly 
shows that NGOs are welcome as long as they are invisible and silent.
The physical access of NGOs to the plenary hall is not only an organisational matter, but a political one as described in a Statement on safeguarding civil society participation in the Helsinki process – a matter of the OSCE’s raison d’ être,
 issued by the CSP in December 2017. The exclusion of NGOs thus 
contradicts all that the OSCE stands for. The treatment of NGOs at the 
OSCE Ministerial Council Meeting in Milano is yet another sign of 
shrinking civil society space (see the CSP’s Hamburg Declaration from 2016), including in the OSCE work (see the CSP’s Milano statement on safeguarding NGO participation in OSCE events,
 which was handed over to high-level OSCE representatives, including the
 Italian OSCE Chairmanship, on 5 December 2018) and an early warning 
sign threatening the principles laid down in the Helsinki Final Act.
 To our great regret, the decision to exclude NGOs from the MC plenary 
hall for the opening and closing session was not communicated to NGO 
partners by the Italian OSCE Chairmanship, nor was the change in 
modalities indicated in Circular Note 6 (MC.INF/8/18 of 12 November 2018),
 which reiterated the OSCE Rules regarding NGO physical access to the 
opening and closing sessions and a live broadcast of MC proceedings in 
the NGO centre. Only on the evening of 5 December did NGOs learn from 
the technical staff that they would not be allowed to physically attend 
the MC meeting, by which time it was too late for them to address and 
resolve the matter with the OSCE leadership. The absence of timely 
communication from the Italian OSCE Chairmanship thus resulted in the 
accredited NGO representatives spending their scarce financial resources
 in vain by staying for two extra days after the OSCE Parallel Civil Society Conference on
 5 December 2018 without achieving any level of meaningful debate or 
interaction with the MC participants. To our dismay, this lack of 
information and access for NGOs has unfortunately been a recurrent 
problem during the Italian Chairmanship.
We note that in a statement made by the OSCE Chairperson-in-Office, 
Minister of Foreign Affairs of Italy Enzo Moavero Milanesi at the 
closing press conference of the MC meeting he noted that he had not been
 aware of the problem of exclusion of NGOs and that this was a mistake 
and a “negative experience that should not be repeated in the future”.
 We also note with satisfaction the words of the incoming OSCE 
Chairperson-in-Office, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Slovakia Miroslav 
Lajčák at the press conference who stated that Slovakia is strongly 
committed to cooperation with civil society and will guarantee access by
 NGOs to the MC in Bratislava in 2019 in full accordance with OSCE 
rules.
We hope that all parties concerned will draw lessons from the 
negative experience in Milano. We reiterate our call to all OSCE actors,
 including the Chairmanships, executive bodies, autonomous institutions,
 and participating States, to protect and expand civil society space and
 ensure unhindered and meaningful NGO participation in OSCE events.
In particular, we call on the incoming Slovak OSCE Chairmanship to:
appoint an NGO liaison within the Chairmanship Task Force to 
serve as a focal point for civil society and regularly provide NGOs with
 information on dates and themes of upcoming OSCE events, modalities of 
events, and relevant Chairmanship’s decisions;ensure meaningful NGO participation in relevant OSCE events of all 
three dimensions, in the spirit of the comprehensive security approach;appoint a Personal Representative of the Chairperson-in-Office on 
Civil Society, to indicate a strong political position of the Slovak 
Chairmanship in respect of the problem of shrinking civil society space 
across the OSCE region and at the multilateral level;ensure unhindered access for NGOs to the opening and closing 
sessions of the MC meeting in Bratislava and live broadcast of MC 
proceedings to the NGO centre there, in accordance with OSCE Rules, as 
well as conditions for holding side events by NGOs in the mixed zone and
 timely provision of any relevant information to NGOs;ensure personal receipt of the outcome documents of the OSCE Parallel Civil Society Conference by the OSCE Chairperson-in-Office (together with other high-level Troika members and OSCE actors);ensure that the OSCE Chairperson-in-Office mentions the receipt of 
the outcome documents of the OSCE Parallel Civil Society Conference and 
the importance of cooperation with civil society in his speeches (in 
particular his opening speech) at the OSCE MC;ensure distribution of the outcome documents of the OSCE Parallel 
Civil Society Conference to all OSCE actors, including the Troika, 
executive bodies, autonomous institutions, and participating States;exercise leadership and adopt a strong stance on protecting and 
expanding civil society space in the course of ongoing negotiations on 
NGO access to OSCE events.For more information, please contact the CSP Secretariat at info@civicsolidarity.org.
