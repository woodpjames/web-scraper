This only demonstrates the disdain of the Mexican State towards women who, now, are victims of impunity, as well as the doublespeak and political theater that characterizes the State’s performance in international fora.Center Prodh and the OMCT call on the Mexican State to inform the complainants and their legal representatives of all the information and updates concerning the Atenco case, with the purpose of providing the victims access to justice, instead of forcing them to learn of such information before international bodies.We are confident that, in the face of these inconsistencies, the CEDAW Committee will confirm the State’s noncompliance with the recommendations itissued on the case of the women of Atenco in 2006, and that it will reiterate that the Mexican State is obligated to effectively punish all those responsible. Miguel Agustin Pro Juárez Human Rights CenterWorld Organization Against Torture
