Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Bahrain Human Rights Organisation (BHRO) of the use of tear gas and rubber bullets fired at demonstrators, demanding the restoration of Bahrain's constitution, by security forces on the night of 18th January.    A number of citizens were also arrested, including two 12 year old boys, Mohammed Abdullah Juma (from Karbabad), and Abdul Shahid Khamis (from Sanabis). Other detainees included Baqir Ibrahim Khamis, Ahmed Al-Motawwa, Jaffer from Arad, Mohmood Isa, Hassan Al-Mulla, and several others.  According to the reports, citizens from the areas surrounding Karbabad marched on the main Budaya Highway on 18 January, around 7.30 p.m. denouncing the government's attempts to deface Bahrain's constitution. The demonstrators called for the restoration of the 1973 constitution, an immediate end to the siege imposed on Sheikh Al-Jamri and the bringing to justice of those people responsible for torturing and killing citizens.  The foreign-staffed security forces attacked the demonstrators with rubber bullets and tear gas. In response, the citizens threw stones and burned car tyres to minimise the effects of tear gas.   Further reports from BHRO, note that on 21 January, several dawn raids were conducted against scores of houses. At 1.00 am units belonging to the interior ministry attacked Karbabad and raided the houses of Mahmood Abdul Nabi  Ahmed (18 years old), Ibrahim Radhi Abdul Abbas (20 years), Ali Jasim Ali (20 years), Isa Abdul Nabi Al-Daqqaq (20 years), and Samir Jaffer Habib (22 years).
