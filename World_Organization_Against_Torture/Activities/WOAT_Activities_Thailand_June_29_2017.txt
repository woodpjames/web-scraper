The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a
partnership of FIDH and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT),
requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in Thailand.
 
Description of the situation:
 
The
Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the arbitrary
detention and subsequent release on bail of pro-democracy activist Mr. Rome Rangsiman, Coordinator of the Democracy Restoration Group (DRG)[1]
and a former member of the New Democracy Movement (NDM)[2].
 
According
to the information received, on June 25, 2017, Mr. Rome Rangsiman was
arrested at Bangkok City Library, detained at Chanasongkram police station in
Bangkok, and subsequently taken to Bang Sao Thong police station in Samut
Prakan Province. Mr. Rangsiman’s arrest was the result of an arrest warrant
issued by the Bangkok Military Court and executed in connection with the
alleged violation of Article 61 of the Referendum Act and National Council for
Peace and Order (NCPO) Order no. 3/2015 on June 23, 2016. On that day, Mr.
Rangsiman distributed flyers that called for a “no” vote in the constitutional
referendum that was held on August 7, 2016.
 
Mr.
Rangsiman’s arrest occurred a few hours before he was due to speak at an event
commemorating the 85th anniversary of the ‘1932 Siamese Revolution’[3],
entitled “Start Up People: Start Up Talk & Music” and on the eve of the
submission by the DRG of a petition to the ruling military junta demanding transparency
over a planned Thai-Chinese railway project.
 
On
June 26, 2017, the Bangkok Military Court ordered the release of Mr. Rangsiman
on a 60,000 THB bail (approximately 1,575 Euros), on condition that he refrains
from traveling abroad and participating in political gatherings. These conditions
are inconsistent with Thailand’s obligations under Articles 12 and 21 of the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). As of publishing
this Urgent Appeal, no date had been set up for Mr. Rangsiman’s trial.
 
The
Observatory recalls that Thai authorities have a long record of judicial harassment
against Mr. Rangsiman, who was arbitrarily detained on several occasions[4].
 
The
Observatory expresses its concern over the arbitrary detention and judicial
harassment of Mr. Rangsiman, which only aim at punishing him for his peaceful
and legitimate human rights activities, aiming at promoting freedom of
expression in Thailand.
 
The
Observatory urges Thai authorities to put an end to any act of harassment,
including at the judicial level, against Mr. Rangsiman and to immediately lift
all restrictions on his rights to freedom of movement and freedom of peaceful
assembly.
 
Actions requested:
 
Please write
to the Thai authorities asking them to:
 
i.
Put an end to any kind of harassment - including at the judicial level -
against Mr. Rome Rangsiman, as well as all human rights defenders in Thailand;
 
ii.
Guarantee in all circumstances Mr. Rome Rangsiman’s rights to freedom of
movement and freedom of peaceful assembly by immediately and unconditionally
lifting the ban on overseas travel and the participation in political
gatherings;
 
iii.
Conform to the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders,
adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998,
in particular with its Articles 1, 5(a), and 12.2;
 
iv.
Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental
freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and
international instruments ratified by Thailand.
