Description of the situation: The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the sentencing of the prominent blogger and human rights defender, Mr. Nguyen Hoang Hai, known under his pen name Dieu Cay, also founding member of the “Free Vietnamese Journalists Club”. According to the information received, on December 4, 2008, the Ho Chi Minh City People’s Court upheld the first instance two and a half year jail sentence pronounced on September 10, 2008 against Mr. Dieu Cay’s for “tax fraud”. Mr. Dieu Cay had been arrested on April 19, 2008 and was charged with tax fraud five days later. According to his family, he had been under close police surveillance since taking part in demonstrations in Ho Chi Minh City to protest against Chinese policy in the Spratly and Paracel islands at the start of the year. The police has been harassing his family, his property has been seized and close colleagues have been threatened or arrested. Mr. Dieu Cay, who is known for articles calling for human rights and democratic reforms posted on the Internet, and had been awarded on October 29, 2008 a prize by the US-based Vietnam Human Rights Network (VNHRN) for his commitment to freedom of expression, had been unjustly accused of having failed for ten years to pay taxes on premises. Said taxes should have been paid by the owner of the premises not Mr. Dieu Cay, who was only renting them. As of issuing this urgent appeal, no further information could be gathered on Mr. Dieu Cai’s place of detention. Furthermore, on December 2, 2008, Mr. Do Quy Doan, Vice Minister of Information, announced that new rules would be issued to regulate blogging. Le Doan Hop, Minister of Information and Communications, asserted that the intent of the new regulation was “limiting blackening the ruling apparatus, particularly State officials, and annulling and restricting anti-government propagandas that undermine the great unity in the nation”. The Observatory expresses its deepest concern with Mr. Dieu Cay’s sentencing, which seems to sanction his human rights activities and is a further attempt from the Vietnamese authorities to punish human rights defenders for exercising their right to freedom of expression and which aims at silencing them. Moreover, the Observatory expresses its deepest concern over the announcement that new regulations on blogging would be adopted and fears that freedom of expression might be further restricted. Action requested: Please write to the authorities in Vietnam urging them to:   Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Dieu Cai;  Release Mr. Dieu Cai immediately and unconditionally as his deprivation of liberty is arbitrary since it only seems to sanction his human rights activities;  Put an end to all acts of harassment, including at the judicial level, against all Vietnamese human rights defenders;  Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, and Article 12.2, which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”;  More generally, ensure in all circumstances the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with international and regional human rights instruments ratified by Viet Nam.
