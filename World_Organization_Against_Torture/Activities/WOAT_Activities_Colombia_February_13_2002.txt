Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed of the forced entry and illegal inspection of the residences of Nelson Delgado Susa  and Heriberto Herrera by armed members of the Public Prosecutor’s Office and the Administrative Department of Security (DAS) in the city of Bogota, Colombia.  According to the information received from the Colectivo de Abogados « José Alvear Restrepo », on February 4th, 2002, at around 14h30, members of the Public Prosecutor’s Office, DAS, and even members of the Bomb Squad Group arrived in several vehicles at the residence of Mr. Nelson Delgado Susa, located in a humble neighbourhood of Zone 20, in Bogota.  Many of the men were armed, and subsequently pointed their guns at the residents, claiming that they came to inspect the residence of Mr. Nelson Delgado Susa, but did not show any identification documents or any search warrants.  According to the reports, the inspection of the residence of Mr. Nelson Delgado Susa, a peasant leader from the area of Cabrera (Cundimarca) and former member of the Permanent Committee of Human Rights, was carried out violently, throwing and disarranging his property.  After finding diverse copies of legal Colombian newspapers, among them «Voz» (edited by the Colombian Communist Party), and one official newspaper that compiled public hearings from the Zona de Despeje in San Vicente del Caguán, Mr. Nelson Delgado Susa was interrogated on his alleged participation in the Communist Party, which he denied.  The reports emphasize as a worrying fact, that Mr. Nelson Delgado Susa was displaced from the plain of Sumapaz, which was bombarded about a year ago by the National Army during a counter-guerrilla operation.  The operation reportedly gravely affected civil society in the area.  Among those affected is one of the granddaughters of Mr. Nelson Delgado Susa, who is 3-years old and who has not spoken since the event; this incident forced Mr. Nelson Delgado Susa and his family to move to Bogota, to the house that was inspected, so the girl could received medical attention.   In addition, according to the reports, that same day, hours later, various members of the Public Prosecutor’s Office and DAS, applied the same procedure to break into the house of Mr. Heriberto Herrera, who is a friend of Mr. Nelson Delgado Susa.  The International Secretariat of OMCT shares its concern, along with Colectivo de Abogados « José Alvear Restrepo », for the security and physical and psychological integrity of Heriberto Herrera and in particular of Nelson Delgado Susa, whose condition as displaced has been aggravated.     Action requested  Please write to the authorities in Colombia urging them to:  i.	take all necessary measures to guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of Nelson Delgado Susa, and Heriberto Herrera, and their families;  ii.	order a thorough and impartial investigation into the circumstances of these events  in order to identify those responsible, bring them to trial and apply the penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions as provided by law;  iii.	guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
