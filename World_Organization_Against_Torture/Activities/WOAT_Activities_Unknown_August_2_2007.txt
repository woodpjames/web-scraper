Description of the situation: The Observatory was informed by the Iranian League for the Defence of Human Rights (LDDHI) of the sentencing on July 31, 2007 of Mr. Emadeddin Baghi, a journalist involved in the defence of human rights, to three years in prison and of the suspended sentences on his wife, Mrs. Fatemeh Kamali Ahmad Sarahi, editor of the now-closed monthly Jameh-e-no, as well as his daughter, Ms. Maryam Baghi. According to the information received, Mr. Baghi was condemned by the Tehran Revolutionary Court on July 31, 2007, for articles he had written in the Jomhouriat newspaper, of which he had been the editor-in-chief until it was closed down by the authorities in September 2004. The articles called for the defence of persons who were sentenced to death in the southern Khozestan region. He was condemned for “activities against national security” and “publicity in favour of the regime’s opponents”. On the same day, his wife and his daughter were given three-year suspended prison sentences and five years of probation for “meeting and colluding with the aim of disrupting national security”, after taking part in a series of human rights workshops in Dubai in 2004. Mr. Baghi, his wife and his daughter have appealed their sentence. As a consequence, Mr. Baghi is not presently detained. Over the past years, Mr. Baghi and his wife have been subjected to repeated acts of harassment due to their human rights activities. In particular, Mr. Baghi has already been detained from 2000 to 2003 for “attacking national security” in relation to articles he had written on human rights and against the death penalty. On leaving prison, he set up an organisation to defend the rights of prisoners of conscience, the Society for Defending Prisoners’ Rights. Moreover, his passport was confiscated on October 4, 2004, on the eve of his travel to Montreal, where he had planned to participate in the 2nd World Congress Against Death Penalty which was held from October 6 to 9, 2004. He has been banned from leaving the country since then and was accordingly prevented from going to France in December 2005 in order to receive the Human Rights Prize which had been awarded to him by the French National Consultative Commission on Human Rights (Commission Nationale Consultative des Droits de l’Homme - CNCDH)[1]. The Observatory expresses its deepest concern over the constant repression of human rights defenders in Iran, and urges the Iranian authorities to conform to Article 6(b) of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others [... to]  freely to publish, impart or disseminate to others views, information and knowledge on all human rights and fundamental freedoms”. The Observatory further wishes to recall that Iran had committed to “uphold the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights”[2] by presenting its candidacy to the Human Rights Council 2006 election and insisted in this regard on the fact that the country had “continuously put great efforts into safeguarding the status and inherent dignity of the human person as well as the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms”[3]. In order to ensure the continuation of these efforts, the Observatory strongly urges the Islamic Republic of Iran to conform with international human rights standards.
