APPEAL - THE OBSERVATORY
SYR 001 / 0312 / OBS 026Incommunicado detentionSyriaMarch 21, 2012The 
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint 
programme of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and 
the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent 
intervention in the following situation in Syria.

Description of the situation:

The Observatory has been 
informed by reliable sources about the arbitrary arrest of Mr. Saleh 
Shameya, a prominent lawyer, member of the board and head of the legal 
department of the National Human Rights Organisation-Syria (NOHR-S) in 
Idleb. Mr. Shameya has been involved in assisting victims of human 
rights violations, working on penal reform and strongly denouncing 
conditions of detention in Syria.According to the information received, on March 17, 2012, Mr. 
Shameya was arrested while he was observing a peaceful assembly in the 
centre of Idleb. His arrest was carried out by the Syrian Intelligence 
service (Mukhabarat) while a military operation was led simultaneously 
against the demonstrators using rockets and heavy artillery. His 
whereabouts have not been disclosed as of yet and he remains thus in 
incommunicado custody.

The Observatory is deeply concerned by Mr. Saleh Shameya’s arrest 
and fears for his physical and psychological integrity, particularly in 
the current context of widespread resort to acts of torture and 
ill-treatment in detention centres in Syria. The Observatory calls upon 
the Syrian authorities to take prompt action in order to disclose his 
fate and whereabouts and release him immediately as it believes that his
 arrest merely aimed at sanctioning his human rights activities.

Actions requested:

Please write to the Syrian authorities, urging them to:

i. Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological 
integrity of Mr. Saleh Shameya, as well as of all human rights defenders
 in Syria;

ii. Take prompt action in order to disclose the fate and whereabouts
 of Mr. Saleh Shameya and unconditionally release him, as his arrest 
seems to solely aim at impeding him from pursuing his human rights 
activities;

iii. Ensure in all circumstances that Syrian human rights defenders 
are able to carry out their work without unjustified hindrances;

iv. Comply with all the provisions of the United Nations Declaration
 on Human Rights Defenders, in particular with its Article 1, which 
provides that “everyone has the right, individually and in association 
with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realization
 of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and 
international levels”, as well as with Article 12.2 “the State shall 
take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent 
authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, 
against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse 
discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence 
of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the 
present Declaration”;

v. Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and 
fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights 
standards and international instruments ratified by the Syrian Arab 
Republic.
