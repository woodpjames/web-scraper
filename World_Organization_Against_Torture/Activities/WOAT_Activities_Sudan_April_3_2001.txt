According to the SVTG, Dr Nageeb has confirmed that “he had not been ill treated or tortured, and wishes to express his thanks to those who campaigned for his release.” Dr Nageeb is a member of SVTG network in Sudan, the Director of the Amal Centre for Rehabilitation of Victims of Physical and Mental Trauma, and the former Secretary General of the banned Sudanese Doctors Unions.
