The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint
programme of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World
Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), has received new information and requests
your urgent intervention in the following situation in Bahrain.
 
New information:
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the sentencing
of Mr. Mohammed
Al-Maskati, former President of the Bahrain Youth Society for
Human Rights (BYSHR) and digital security consultant at Front Line Defenders.
On December 31, 2014, the Lower Criminal Court sentenced Mr. Al-Maskati to six
months imprisonment on charges of “rioting and participating in an illegal
gathering” in relation to a protest in Manama on October 12, 2012 (see
background information). Mr. Al-Maskati is not currently detained as a BHD 100
(approximately EUR 222) bail was paid so that he can remain out of prison
pending the appeal hearing scheduled for September 7, 2015.
 
The Observatory condemns the sentencing of Mr. Al-Maskati and calls upon
the Bahraini authorities to drop all charges against him as it is aimed at
hindering his human rights activities.
 
The
Observatory more generally urges the Bahraini authorities to put an end to all
acts of harassment – including at the judicial level – against Mr. Al-Maskati,
and to comply with the relevant international norms and standards, in
particular the United Nations (UN) Declaration on Human Rights Defenders,
adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 9, 1998, and international human
rights standards and international instruments ratified by Bahrain.
 
Background information:
 
On October 17, 2012, Mr. Al-Maskati appeared before Bahrain’s
public prosecution on charges of “participation in illegal protests” in
relation to a peaceful gathering held in Manama on October 12, 2012. He had
been summoned the day before to Al Hoora police station, where he had been kept
overnight before being referred to the prosecutor’s office. He was released on
bail on the same day pending charges. On June 19, 2013, Mr. Al-Maskati
appeared before the Lower Criminal Court under these same charges Mr. Al-Maskati’s
lawyers asked for the case file, and the judge decided to adjourn the case to
July 9, 2013 and then to December 9, 2013.
Previously, on September 23, 2012, Mr. Al-Maskati and other
Bahraini human rights defenders who had cooperated with the United Nations (UN)
had received threats of reprisals while they were in Geneva to participate in
the 21st session of the UN Human Rights Council. Mr. Al-Maskati was
notably threatened with death through more than a dozen anonymous phone calls.
In another case, on October 22, 2013, Mr. Al-Maskati was summoned to
Al-Khamis Police Station where he was interrogated on charges of “inciting
hatred against the regime”, based on a speech he made on September 8, 2013 in
Jidhafs Town, where he spoke on the concept of non-violence and the importance
of peacefully demanding the respect of rights as well as on the rights
enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). He was released
only after signing a pledge to appear before the Public Prosecution upon
request.
