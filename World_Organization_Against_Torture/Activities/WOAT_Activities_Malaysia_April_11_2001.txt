Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by Pax Romana, a member of the OMCT network, that six pro-reform activists have been detained under the ISA in Malaysia.  According to the information received, the Malaysian authorities arrested five pro-reform activists under the Internal Security Act (ISA) on April 10, 2001. These included: Mr. Mahd. Ezam Mhd. Noor (Head of the National Youth - NY - movement); Mr. Chua Tian Chang (NY Vice President); Mr. N Gobala Krishnan (NY Secretary); Mr. Haji Saari Sungip (April 14th Rally Organising Chairperson); and Mr. Hishamuddin Rais (freelance journalist/film-maker). This was followed on April 11, 2001, by the arrest of Mr. Raja Petra Kamaruddin (Free Anwar Campaign website executive director), also under the auspices of the ISA.  According to the information received, all six men were participating in the organisation of a rally at the National Human Rights Commision, scheduled for April 14, 2001 - the second anniversary of the conviction of former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim – where they were expected to hand in a “people’s” memorandum on the state of human rights in Malaysia.   According to reports, the ISA has been frequently used since its enactment in 1960 by the Malaysian authorities, in order to arrest and effectively indefinitely detain human rights and oppostition campaigners. The ISA reportedly allows the authorities to arbitrarily arrest, detain incommunicado and interrogate activists, without granting them access to legal counsel or family visits for up 60 days, and without conducting a trial for a period of up to two years. This period is however renewable by the Prime Minister, meaning that the person can effectively be detained indefinitely without a trial.   The ISA violates the detainee's rights to access to legal counsel, family visits and a fair trial and is often used to supress the person's rights of expression and to demonstration. Detainees under the ISA are reportedly often subjected to various forms of torture, including physical assault, sleep deprivation, round-the-clock interrogation, threats of bodily harm to family members, including detainees' children, and are allegedly often used to extract false signed confessions from the detainees.  OMCT is gravely concerned for the six men's physical and psychological integrity, given the circumstances of their arrest and the reported inherant use of torture by the Malaysian authorities in such cases.  Action requested  Please write to the authorities in Malaysia urging them to: 1.	take all necessary measures to guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of the above-mentioned persons; 2.	order their immediate release in the absence of valid legal charges or, if such charges exist, bring them before an impartial and competent tribunal and guarantee their procedural rights at all times; 3.	guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
