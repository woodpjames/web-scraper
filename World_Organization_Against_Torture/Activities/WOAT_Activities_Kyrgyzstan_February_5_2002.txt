New information  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Kyrgyz Committee for Human Rights, a member of the OMCT network, of developments concerning the trial of Kyrgyz Parliamentarian, Mr. Azimbek Beknazarov in Kyrgyzstan.  According to the information received, the trial of Kyrgyz Parliamentarian Deputy Mr. Azimbek Beknazarov is now set to take place on February 12th, 2002, at the Toktogul District Court, in the Jalal-Abad region, Kyrgyzstan. Since the arrest of Mr. Beknazarov, which took place on January 5th, 2002, an estimated 621 protestors have reportedly engaged in hunger strikes, with the current number of hunger strikers thought to number around 420 in the Jalal-Abad region and 32 in Bishkek. The hunger strikes in Bishkek reportedly began on January 10th, 2002.   According to the information received, a number of protestors have reportedly been arrested by the Kyrgyz authorities, and it is believed that Mr. Japaraly Kamchybekov (who was involved in the murder case in 1995 – see Urgent Appeal KGZ 290102 for further details) and his father, Mr. Janatbek Kamchybekov (who is a pensioner), have been arrested and tortured by the Kyrgyz authorities, in order to force them to give false evidence against Deputy Beknazarov. Furthermore, on January 17th, 2002, Mr. Chynybekov Talant, who had been conducting a hunger strike for eight days, was arrested in the street by militia officers and taken to an undisclosed location.  The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned that, due to the suspected political agenda that is thought to have motivated his arrest, Deputy Beknazarov will not be afforded a fair trial. OMCT also remains gravely concerned for the physical and psychological integrity of the arrested demonstrators and all the persons engaged in hunger strikes, and condemns the Kyrgyz authorities’ use of arbitrary arrests, detention and harassment of persons connected with or protesting in favour of Mr. Bernazarov.  Brief reminder of the situation  Deputy Beknazarov was reportedly arrested on January 5th, 2002, and was charged under two clauses of the Kyrgyz Criminal Code: clause 177(2) – abuse of power; and clause 185(2) – deliberate detention of an innocent person, following allegations that he had mishandled a murder case, which took place in February 1995, when Mr. Beknazarov was an investigator at the office of the Toktogul District Prosecutor. It is, however, believed that Mr. Beknazarov’s arrest is largely politically motivated, and is a result of his recent criticism of the Government, most notably the Kyrgyz-Chinese agreement, under to which a section of Kyrgyz territory (some 125,000 hectares) was transferred to China, and more recently, his public opposition of a similar Kyrgyz land transfer to Kazakhstan.  According to the information received, the Southern Jalal-Abad Province Prosecutors submitted their investigation documents concerning Deputy Beknazarov to the Toktogul District court on January 29th, 2002.  According to reports, on February 1st, 2002, 45 persons were demonstrating against Deputy Beknazarov’s arrest. 35 of them were reportedly arrested by the authorities and were taken to an unknown destination. There are grave fears for their physical and psychological integrity (see Urgent Appeal KGZ 290102.1 for further details). Furthermore, the Kyrgyz authorities have reportedly threatened, arrested and even sentenced a number of other protestors to short prison terms, in blatant violation of these persons’ rights to the freedom of assembly and expression.  Action requested :  Please write to the authorities in Kyrgyzstan urging them to:  i.  take all necessary measures to guarantee Deputy Beknazarov’s physical and psychological integrity and that of all persons being detained in connection with the case; ii. order Deputy Beknazarov and the protestors’ immediate release in the absence of valid legal charges or, if such charges exist, bring them before an impartial and competent tribunal and guarantee their procedural rights at all times; iii. put an immediate end to the persecution and harassment of the above-mentioned persons; iv. guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
