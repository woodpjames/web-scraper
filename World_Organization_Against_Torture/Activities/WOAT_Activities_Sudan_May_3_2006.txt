Brief description of the situationThe International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Sudan Organisation Against Torture (SOAT), a member of the OMCT network, that on 22 April 2006 three people were killed, over fifty were injured and three people were arrested and detained following an attack by the security forces in Marawi.   According to the information received, security forces in Marawi, armed with machine guns and heavy artillery, fired live ammunition into a crowd of villagers whilst they were having breakfast in a nearby school yard, Amri Shool. The incident, which took place at 11.00 am in the presence of police officers, resulted in the death of three people and injured over fifty others, who were taken by local people to the nearest hospital at Kariema town, 25 km from the Amri School. Moreover, following the attack, the security officers arrested and detained three of the victims. The detainees are currently held in police custody in Marawi and are charged under the following articles of the Sudanes Criminal Code: article 51 (waging war against the state, which if convicted carries the death penalty); article 182 (criminal mischief) and article 139 (penalty for causing intentional wounding).   According to the information received, the villagers had gathered in the school to discuss how the building of a dam had affected their livelihoods. It is reported that the dam, which is financed by several Arab funds and executed by Chinese companies, has resulted in the displacements of thousands of people along the riverbanks. Among the people affected by its construction are the Amri people, who have been in negotiations with the government over the past two years regarding resettlement areas: they have requested resettlement in the vicinity of the dam resevoir. The situation in Marawi has been tense since work began on the government-backed project of the dam construction despite the absence of consultation with the local surrounding population, and lack of provisions for compensation scheme for loss of homes and livelihoods. The government has rejected the request of the inhabitants and insisted on resettlement of the Amri people to Bayouda desert. The Amri people have refused to be relocated to Bayouda and allege that the local Dam authorities have already in fact sold their lands to Arab investors.      The details of the three persons killed are: 1.      Mr. Atta Al sayed Al Khidir Al Mahi, (30 yrs), farmer from Abu Haraze village. 2.
