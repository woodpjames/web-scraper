The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of
the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and the International Federation
for Human Rights (FIDH), has received new information and requests your urgent
intervention in the following situation in Cambodia. 

New
information:
The
Observatory has been informed by the Cambodian Center for Human Rights (CCHR)
about the sentencing of Mr. Ven Vorn, an Areng Valley environmental activist and a community
leader for the indigenous Chong minority in Koh Kong Province.
According to
the information received, on March 3, 2016, the Koh Kong Provincial Court found
Mr. Ven Vorn guilty of “harvesting timber products and/or non-timber
forest products without a permit” (Article 98 of the Forestry Law) and
sentenced him to a one-year suspended prison sentence. Mr. Ven Vorn was released
on the same day from Koh Kong Provincial Prison, where he had been detained
since his arrest on October 7, 2015 (See background information). 
The Observatory welcomes the release of Mr. Ven Vorn
but strongly condemns his conviction and the
arbitrary detention and judicial harassment to which he was subjected, which only aimed at sanctioning his legitimate human rights activities.
The
conviction of activists involved in high-profile cases and their release on
suspended sentences has become an often-used tactic by the Cambodian
authorities to criminalize legitimate activism. Accordingly, the Observatory calls on the Cambodian authorities to put an end to all
acts of judicial harassment against all human rights defenders in Cambodia.
The
Observatory recalls that Messrs. Sim Samnang, Tri Sovichea and
San Mala, members of the
organisation “Mother Nature”[1],have been arbitrarily detained since August 17, 2015[2].
The Observatory calls on the Cambodian authorities to immediately and
unconditionally release the three and drop all charges against them.
Background
information:
On September 2, 2015, 17 persons, including Mr. Ven
Vorn, were arrested outside Koh Kong Provincial Court. They were picketing
to demand the release of the three jailed activists, Messrs. Sim
Samnang, Tri Sovichea, and San Mala, who had been involved
in protests against a hydroelectric dam (see below). Mr. Ven Vorn was
subsequently released.
On
October 7, 2015, Mr. Ven Vorn was re-arrested and sent to Koh
Kong Provincial Prison. The arrest followed the decision of Investigating Judge
Mr. Min Makara, who had questioned Mr. Ven Vorn on the same morning and charged
him with “harvesting timber products and/or non-timber forest products without
a permit” (Article 98 of the Forestry Law) and “destruction of evidence”
(Article 533 of the Criminal Code). 
Both of the
above-mentioned charges related to the construction by Mr. Vorn and a group of
local activists of a small visitor centre and community meeting place for local
activists involved in a campaign against the proposed construction of a
hydropower dam in the Areng Valley. According to activists and
environmental groups, the hydropower dam poses a threat to their land,
livelihood, and the natural environment. For this project, Mr. Vorn and others
had purchased approximately 10 cubic metres of wood from a vendor in 2014,
which authorities claimed had been procured by the vendor through illegal
logging.
On February
17, 2016, Mr. Ven Vorn appeared before the Koh Kong Provincial Court to
hear charges of “harvesting timber products and/or non-timber forest
products without a permit” (Article 98 of the Forestry Law) and
“destruction of evidence” (Article 533 of the Criminal Code). The court dropped
the charge of “destruction of evidence” due to a lack of evidence. Mr. Ven Vorn
faced up to five years of imprisonment and a fine of up to ten
million Riel (about 2,250 Euros).
Mr. Ven Vorn
had been previously questioned on April 3, 2015 at the Koh Kong Provincial
Court in relation to the same alleged illegal logging incident before being
released on the same day.
Actions
requested:
Please write
to the authorities of Cambodia asking them to:
i.    Guarantee
in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Ven Vorn
as well as of all human rights defenders in Cambodia;
ii. Immediately and unconditionally release
Messrs. Sim Samnang, Tri Sovichea, and San Mala as their
detention is arbitrary since it only aims at sanctioning their human rights
activities;

of harassment, including at the judicial level, against all human rights
defenders in the country so that they are able to carry out their work without
hindrance;
iv. Comply
with all the provisions of the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights
Defenders, adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 9, 1998, in
particular with its:

protection and fulfilment of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national
and international levels", 
-       
as well as Article 12.2,
which provides that "the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure
the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually or in
association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto
or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a
consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the
present Declaration";
v. Guarantee
the respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with the
Universal Declaration on Human Rights and other international human rights
instruments signed or ratified by the Kingdom of Cambodia.
