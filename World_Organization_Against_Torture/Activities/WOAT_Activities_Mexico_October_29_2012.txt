Finally, the third report, submitted jointly with the Human Rights Centre Miguel Agustín Pro Juárez (Centro de Derechos Humanos Miguel Agustín Pro Juárez) describes the pardigmatic case of IsraelArzate, a young man from Ciudad Juárez who is being tried based solely on his confession obtained by torture.The Committee Against Torture will examine Mexico during its 49 session (29 Octobre - 23 November 2012)
