ESCRC   The International Secretariat of OMCT requests your URGENT intervention in the following situation in Colombia.   Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Central Unitaria de Trabajadores (CUT), a member of the OMCT network, of the arrest, on May 20th 2002, of 85 workers of Telebucaramanga, a public telecommunication company located in the city of Bucaramanga, in the Santander department.   According to the information received, at approximately 3:30 pm on May 20th 2002, several heavily armed policemen of the SIJIN (Subdireccion de Policia Judicial e Investigacion) accompanied by three public prosecutors broke into the premises of Telebucaramanga, severely damaging the offices of the company, and arrested 85 workers of the company.  The workers of Telebucaramanga had been carrying out a peaceful occupation of the company’s premises since May 14th 2002, protesting against the negative impact that a payment of 800 million dollars owed by the state-owned Telecom to other international telecommunication companies might have on the financial welfare of the company.   Background information  The 6-day peaceful occupation of the premises of Telebucaramanga occurred against the backdrop of the joint venture agreements signed between the state-owned Telecom, which holds 56% of Telebucaramanga, and some foreign telecommunication companies, such as Nortel, Alcatel, Siemens, Nec and Itochu.  According to the above mentioned joint venture agreements, Telecom committed itself to pay to its foreign partners any lost revenue which might arise from the company’s business activity, a sum that should be calculated on the basis of a fixed and predefined amount of revenues guaranteed to the foreign partners.  Thus following the execution of these agreements, it is reported that Telecom today owes to its foreign partners an estimated 1.5 billion US dollars in lost revenues. Telecom’s President, Mr. Gabriel Mesa Zueta, and the Colombian President, Mr. Andres Pastrana, subsequently managed to renegotiate the payment with their foreign partners, reducing it to some 800 million dollars.   Even so, workers of Telebucaramanga are afraid that if the 800 million dollars payment were to be honoured by Telecom, the company itself and all of its subsidiaries, including Telebucaramanga, will very likely go bankrupt, causing a loss of jobs.    Action requested  Please write to the Colombian authorities urging them to:   i.	adopt all necessary measures to guarantee the safety and physical and psychological integrity of the 85 workers of Telebucaramanga;  ii.	guarantee respect for the economic, social and cultural rights and notably the right of trade unions to function freely, as guaranteed by article 8 (b) of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights;  iii.	guarantee in all circumstances the respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the country in accordance with national laws and international standards on human rights.
