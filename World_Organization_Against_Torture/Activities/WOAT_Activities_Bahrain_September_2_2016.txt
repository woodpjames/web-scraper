The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of
the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation
Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent intervention in the following
situation in Bahrain.
 
Description
of the situation:
 
The
Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about a series of travel bans
issued against Ms. Nedal Al-Salman, Head of International
Relations for the Bahrain Center for Human Rights (BCHR), Mr. Mohammed Al Tajer, prominent human rights lawyer, Mr. Ebtisam Al Sayegh, a member of Salam Organization
for Democracy and Human Rights, Mr. Essa Al Ghayeb, Director of the Lualua
Center for Human Rights, Mr. Ahmed Al-Saffar, a member of the European-Bahraini Organisation for Human Rights
(EBOHR), Ms. Enas Oun, Head of
BCHR’s Monitoring and Documentation Section, Mr. Hussain Radhi, member
of the team of BCHR’s Monitoring and Documentation Section, and Ms. Jalila
Al-Salman, President of Bahrain Human Rights Observatory (BHRO), as well as
of the ongoing arbitrary detention of Ms. Ghada Jamsheer, writer,
blogger and President of the Women’s Petition Committee (WPC) and Mr. Nabeel
Rajab, President of the BCHR and FIDH Deputy Secretary General.
 
According to the information
received, in the evening of August 31, 2016, Ms. Jalila Al-Salman was prevented
from leaving Bahrain via the Causeway to Saudi Arabia, and told that she was
banned from leaving the country. Ms. Jalila Al-Salman was planning to
participate in the 33rd session of the United Nations Human Rights
Council (UNHRC) in Geneva, Switzerland.
 
Likewise, on August 29, 2016.
Ms. Nedal Al-Salman was informed by a police officer at Bahrain International
Airport that the Public Prosecution had issued a travel ban against her. Ms.
Nedal Al-Salman intended to travel to Geneva and other locations in Europe in
order to call attention to recent crackdowns on human rights defenders in
Bahrain, and notably on the ongoing arbitrary detention and judicial harassment
of Mr. Nabeel Rajab, whose next hearing is scheduled for September 5, 2016[1].
 
In a similar move, on August
27, 2016, Messrs. Ahmed Al-Saffar and Ebtisam Al Sayegh were prevented from
leaving Bahrain via the Causeway to Saudi Arabia, reportedly pursuant to a ban
issued by the Public Prosecution’s office.
 
Three days before, on August
24, Mr. Essa Al-Ghayeb was stopped by the security authorities of Bahrain
International Airport on his way to Georgia, and told
that the “security apparatuses” had passed an order to prevent him from leaving
the country.
 
Similarly, on August 23, Mr.
Mohammed Al Tajer was informed at Bahrain International Airport of a similar
ban issued by the Public Prosecutor against him. On July 8, he had previously
been denied the right to travel to Saudi Arabia, and has since been unable to
obtain any written confirmation or justification from the passport and
immigration authorities for such a ban.
 
On August 23, Mr. Hussain
Radhi was also informed by officials at Bahrain International
Airport that he was subject to a travel ban ordered by the Criminal
Investigation Department (CID). When he attempted to challenge this ban with
the Public Prosecution, he was informed that a case had been filed against him
for "spreading false news and inciting hatred against the regime",
over remarks he would have made on Twitter.
 
On August 22, 2016, Ms. Enas Oun was in
turn stopped by Bahraini authorities at Bahrain International Airport as she
was on her way to attend a human rights workshop in Tunisia. She was informed that
she was banned from traveling, based on an order issued the day before by the
General Directorate of the CID.
 
The Observatory also deplores the arrest on
August 15, 2016 of Ms. Ghada Jamsheer, upon arrival from London at Bahrain
International Airport. As of issuing this Urgent ppeal, Ms. Jamsheer remains
detained at Isa Town Detention Centre for Women, and was able to call her
family and contact a lawyer. On June 22, 2016, she had been sentenced on appeal
to one year in prison by the Second High Criminal Court, in relation to four
cases related to her tweets outlining corruption practices within the King
Hamad hospital[2].
 
The Observatory strongly denounces the systematic pattern of
obstacles to freedom of movement used by the Bahraini authorities against human
rights defenders, in a clear attempt to hinder their
human rights activities. The Observatory calls
on the Bahraini authorities to immediately put an end to such obstacles, and to
immediately and unconditionally release all those arbitrarily detained in the
country.
 
Action
requested:
 
The
Observatory urges the authorities of Bahrain to: 
 
i.     
Immediately lift the travel bans and
put an end to any obstacles to the freedom of movement of all the
above-mentioned human rights defenders in Bahrain;
 
ii.    
Immediately and unconditionally
release Ms. Ghada Jamsheer, Mr. Nabeel Rajab, and all the other human rights
defenders detained throughout the country, as their detention is arbitrary
since it only aims at sanctioning their human rights activities;
 
iii.  
Put an end to any act of harassment,
including at the judicial level, against the above-mentioned human rights
defenders, and more generally against all human rights defenders in Bahrain; 
 
iv.   
Conform in any circumstances with
the provisions of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted on
December 9, 1998 by the United Nations General Assembly, in particular its
Articles 1, 6(c) and 12.2;
 
v.     Ensure
in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in
accordance with international human rights standards and international
instruments ratified by Bahrain.
