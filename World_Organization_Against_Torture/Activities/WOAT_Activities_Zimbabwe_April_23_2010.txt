The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in Zimbabwe.
Brief description of the information:
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the continuing acts of harassment and intimidation faced by the members of the Women and Men of Zimbabwe Arise (WOZA), a civic movement which defends women's rights and freedoms in Zimbabwe.
According to the information received, on April 15, 2010, approximately at 12:30 a.m, 70 WOZA members were arrested by police officers from Harare Central Police Station while they were participating in a peaceful procession in Harare outside the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA) headquarters. The demonstration sought to put pressure on the electricity service provider to provide a more efficient service and billing system and to stop taking advantage of economic problems to bill people excessively for a substandard service.
Four hours later, 66 WOZA members were released without any charge brought against them. As for Ms. Jennifer Williams, WOZA National Coordinator, Ms. Magodonga Mahlangu, Ms. Clara Manjengwa and Ms. Celina Madukani, they were released from police custody on April 20, after spending five nights in cells. The Attorney General’s office refused to press charges against the four women defenders due to lack of sufficient evidence.
While in detention, the four women endured very bad conditions. The corridors and floor of the female cells were covered in urine and human faeces due to blocked toilets and only sporadic water supply. The four defenders all require medical treatment for a rash all over their bodies and diarrhoea due to the filthy conditions and flu symptoms from the cold conditions. Their bodies also ache from being forced to sit and sleep on cold concrete for six days.
The Observatory expresses its deepest concern about the arbitrary arrest of the above-mentioned WOZA members and believes that their arrest is directly related to their human rights activities. The Observatory is concerned that these acts form part of an ongoing trend of harassment by the Zimbabwe Republic Police against human rights defenders in Zimbabwe, especially against those wishing to exercise their right to demonstrate peacefully.
Actions requested:
Please write to the authorities of Zimbabwe asking them to:

 More generally, ensure in all circumstances the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with international and regional human rights instruments ratified by Zimbabwe.
