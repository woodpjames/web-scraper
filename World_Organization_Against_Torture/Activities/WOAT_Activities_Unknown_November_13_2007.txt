According to the information received, on October 22, 2007, the Iranian Supreme Court upheld the sentence to death of Mr. Hassanpour issued on July 9, 2007 by the Revolutionary Tribunal in Marivan, for, inter alia, “espionage”, “attacks upon national security”, “diffusion of separatist propaganda”, “treason” and “collaboration with Kurdish political opposition parties”. On the same day, the Court quashed the other 9-July decision of the Revolutionary Tribunal concerning Mr. Boutimar, for procedural irregularities. He remains detained, awaiting that his case be referred to another court. However, the decisions of the Supreme Court have just been made public, and have still not been notified to the two defenders, which is a precondition for Mr. Hassanpour to lodge an appeal. The Observatory expresses its deepest concern regarding the confirmation of the death sentence of Mr. Hassanpour, as it appears to be directly aimed at sanctioning his activities in favour of human rights.  Furthermore, the Observatory recalls that numerous United Nations bodies, including the UN Human Rights Committee, the UN Committee Against Torture and the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, have called for the abolition of capital punishment. In addition, international law (Art. 6 of the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in particular) requires that the death penalty be reserved for the most serious crimes only – this can obviously in no way encompass the peaceful expression of dissent. The Observatory also reiterates that as a member of the Human Rights Council, Iran has accepted to “uphold to the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights”[1]. Background information: On July 16, 2007, the Revolutionary Tribunal in Marivan sentenced to death Mr. Adnan Hassanpour and Mr. Abdoulvahid (Hiwa) Boutimar for, inter alia, “espionage”, “attacks upon national security”, “diffusion of separatist propaganda”, “treason” and “collaboration with Kurdish political opposition parties”. Mr. Hassanpour is a member of the Iranian Kurdistan Journalist Association as well as a reporter for the Aso newspaper, a publication banned by Iranian authorities. He is also an active defender of Kurdish cultural rights. Mr. Boutimar is an active member of the environmental NGO Sabzchia. The accused were denied access to legal counsel throughout the entire legal process. After their respective arrest in December 2006 and January 2007, they were held incommunicado in Mariwan prison until July 2007. The two men have been held in Sanandaj Intelligence Service’s jail and they were - for the first time since their arrest - accorded a visit from family members on August 9, 2007. They were both in poor physical and mental health, and informed their families that the Iranian authorities had denied them access to appropriate medical treatment. Actions requested: Please write to the authorities in Iran urging them to:  Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Adnan Hassanpour and Mr. Abdoulvahid (Hiwa) Boutimar; Release Messrs. Hassanpour and Boutimar immediately and unconditionally since their detention is arbitrary as it only seems to sanction their human rights activities; Ensure Mr. Boutimar is granted a fair trial when appealing his sentence, and have unhindered access to legal representation; Ensure that they have access to adequate medical treatment; Put an end to all acts of harassment against all Iranian human rights defenders; Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, Article 6 (b) which stipulates that “everyone has the right […] freely to publish, impart or disseminate to others views, information and knowledge on all human rights and fundamental freedoms”, as well as Article 12(2), which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”; Ensure in all circumstances the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with international and regional human rights instruments ratified by the Islamic Republic of Iran.
