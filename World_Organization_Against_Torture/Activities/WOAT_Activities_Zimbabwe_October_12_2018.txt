The Observatory for the Protection of
Human Rights Defenders, a partnership of FIDH and the World Organisation
Against Torture (OMCT), has received new information and requests your
intervention in the following situation in Zimbabwe.
 
New
information:
 
The Observatory has been
informed by reliable sources about the compensation of Ms. Jestina Mungareva
Mukoko, Executive Director of the Zimbabwe Peace Project (ZPP)[1] and Board Member of the
Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum.  
 
According to the
information received, on September 27, 2018, the High Court of Zimbabwe ordered
the Zimbabwean State to pay a total of 150,000 USD (around 130,580 Euros) to
Ms. Jestina Mukoko before October 31, 2018, in compensation for the abduction,
incommunicado detention and torture she suffered at the hands of state security
agents in 2008 (see background information below). The sum includes 100,000 USD
for her claims and 50,000 USD as a contribution towards her legal costs. 
 
The Observatory recalls
that in December 2008 Ms. Mukoko was abducted, detained incommunicado and
subjected to torture. After her release from prison on March 2, 2009, Ms.
Jestina Mukoko and her lawyer undertook legal action against the State,
demanding a 220,000 USD (around 191,600 Euros) compensation for her abduction.
In September 2009, the High Court of Zimbabwe granted Ms. Jestina Mukoko a
permanent stay of prosecution considering the violation of her fundamental
rights by state security agents. Indeed, Ms. Mukoko was subjected to torture
and inhumane and degrading treatment (i.e. simulated drowning, being locked in
a freezer, physical assaults) by the agents who tried to make her confess plotting
against Robert Mugabe’s administration.
 
On March 27, 2017, the High
Court ruled that those who had illegally arrested her could be sued in their
personal capacities. However, Ms. Mukoko decided not to continue pursuing her
alleged abductors. 
 
The Observatory welcomes
the award of compensation to Ms. Jestina Mukoko and thanks all the persons,
organisations and institutions that intervened in her favour. The Observatory
recalls that this is the first major award of compensation from the State to a
human rights defender in Zimbabwe. 
 
Background information:
 
On December 3, 2008, Ms. Mukoko was abducted by a group of 15
unidentified armed men from her home in Norton. On December 8, 2008, Messrs.
Broderick Takawira, ZPP Provincial Coordinator, and Pascal Gonzo, ZPP driver,
were also abducted by at least five men at the ZPP offices in Harare. Ms.
Mukoko and Mr. Broderick’s whereabouts remained unknown until December 24,
2008, when they first appeared before the Harare Magistrates Court, after weeks
of incommunicado detention.
 
On January 5 and 6,
2009, Ms. Mukoko, Mr. Gonzo and Mr. Takawira, accused by the
Government of “recruiting or goading other people to undergo military training
in neighbouring Botswana aimed at toppling Robert Mugabe’s Government”, appeared
before the Harare Magistrates Court. The hearing in Ms. Mukoko and
Mr. Takawira’s case was then postponed, pending a decision of the High
Court on an application demanding further medical examination in a
well-equipped hospital, as they reportedly bore signs of torture and
ill-treatment.
 
The Observatory was
further informed that during the first ten days of her detention, Ms. Mukoko
was not allowed to take medication for an allergic condition, and was
prescribed medication for anxiety and insomnia by an army doctor who had
facilitated acts of torture against her. 
 
Messrs. Pascal
Gonzo and Broderick Tarawira were released on bail by the High Court of
Zimbabwe on February 6 and 26, 2009, respectively.
 
On March 2, 2009, Ms.
Jestina Mukoko was released on bail by the Harare Magistrates Court’s decision,
on payment of 600 USD (around 523 Euros).
 
Actions requested:

all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Ms. Jestina
