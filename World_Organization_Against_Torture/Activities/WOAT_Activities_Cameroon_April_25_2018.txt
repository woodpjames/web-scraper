The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a
partnership of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and FIDH, requests
your urgent intervention in the following situation in Cameroon.
 
Description of the situation:
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources of the arrest and
arbitrary detention of five members of the association
Avenir Jeune de l’Ouest (AJO), which
promotes the rights of LGBTIQ persons with HIV and sex workers in western Cameroon.
 
According to the information received, on April 20, 2018, at
approximately 7pm, the executive director of AJO, the warden and a care worker
were arrested by men in civilian clothing who were members of the territorial
police as they were leaving the AJO premises. On the morning of 21 April 2018, two
other care workers from AJO were arrested at their respective places of
residence. No arrest warrant was produced during these arrests. The five
members of AJO were taken to Dschang central police station where they are
still detained in a single cell with neither sanitary facilities nor beds. Despite
their serious medical conditions, the prisoners have not been seen by a doctor.
 
On April 23 and 24, 2018, the five members of AJO were questioned by the
Dschang territorial security officers who informed them of charges of “homosexuality”
brought against them under article 347-1 of the Cameroon Penal Code. They are
facing up to five years in prison and a fine of 200,000 CFA Francs (around 300 Euros).
Those accused of homosexuality Cameroon are regularly subjected to an anal
examination which is a form of cruel, degrading and inhuman treatment which can
be tantamount to torture. During their interrogation, the police officers told
the members of AJO that they had been “on their trail for some time”. 
 
The five members of AJO did not have access to their lawyers until 24 April
2018. In addition, the territorial security officers made false statements to
their lawyers, claiming that the AJO members had only been in custody since 22 April
2018. 
 
The Observatory recalls that in September 2017, the members of AJO received
threats from unidentified individuals who had daubed insults on the walls of
the AJO offices. During the same period, the executive director of AJO had
received death threats over the telephone from an anonymous caller.  Following these threats, a complaint was filed
against unknown persons; the police authorities failed to follow up the matter.  
 
The Observatory strongly condemns
the judicial harassment and arbitrary detention of the five members of AJO, who
seem to have been targeted and punished for their peaceful and legitimate
activities in defence of human rights and of the rights of LGBTIQ persons specifically,
against a backdrop of intense discrimination and criminalisation of such
persons. The Observatory is particularly concerned as threats and attacks
against the physical integrity of LGBTIQ rights defenders in Cameroon have in
recent years reached alarming proportions in a climate of almost complete
impunity[1].
 
The Observatory calls on the Cameroonian authorities to guarantee the
physical and psychological integrity of the five members of AJO under all
circumstances, to ensure their immediate and unconditional release and to
guarantee that their right to a fair trial for all of the charges made against
them is respected.
