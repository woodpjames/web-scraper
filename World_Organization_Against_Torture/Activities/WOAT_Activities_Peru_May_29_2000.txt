Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of the OMCT was informed of the torture suffered by journalist Fabian Salazar Olivares at the hands of presumed agents of the National Intelligence Service, SIN, in Peru.  According to the Peruvian National Coordination Committee on Human Rights, on May 24th at approximately 19:00 hours, presumed agents of the SIN entered the office  of journalist Fabián Salazar, for the purpose of discovering the identity of those who provided him with information allegedly connecting the presidential adviser Vladimiro Montesinos with the authorities in charge of the electoral system, journalists, and the communication media bosses and investigation companies.  In order to achieve their objective the SIN agents sat the journalist in a chair and gagged him with adhesive tape, covering his eyes, mouth and feet. Having  immobilized him they switched on the television with the volume at high and proceeded to question him, whilst slowly cutting his left wrist with a saw. Suspecting that the caretaker of the building had called for help the torturers decided to abandon the office.  Before doing so they attempted to set the office on fire with petrol thinking that the journalist had fainted, but he was able to extricate himself and escape from  the premises.   The International Secretariat of the OMCT condemns the treacherous attack on Sr. Fabian Salazar Olivares and shares the grave concern due to the absence of guarantees protecting the right to freedom of opinion and other fundamental rights in Peru.  Action requested   Please write to the Peruvian authorities strongly urging them to:  i.	guarantee the safety and the physical and psychological integrity of Sr.  Fabian Salazar Olivares, including adequate and free health care;  ii.	carry out the thorough and impartial investigation of the facts referred to above in order to identify those responsible, bring them to justice before a competent and impartial tribunal and impose upon them the penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions provided by law;  iii.	ensure the respect of the right to freedom of expression and allow the journalists to do their work throughout the whole of the country;  iv.	guarantee in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental liberties in accordance with national and international laws on human rights, in particular the provisions of the Convention against Torture ratified by Peru.
