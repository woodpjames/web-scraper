Arbitrary detention / Release on bail
Judicial harassment
Egypt
June 26, 2017
 
The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a partnership of the
World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and the FIDH, requests your urgent
intervention in the following situation in Egypt.
 
Description of the situation:
 
The
Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the arbitrary arrest, detention,
release on bail and judicial harassment of Ms. Esraa Fehead, Founder and Executive Director of Horeya for Human
Rights Organization in Port Said and a member of the Regional Coalition for
Women Human Rights Defenders in MENA as well as of Mr. Mahmoud Naguib, a former member of the April 6 Youth Movement[1].
 
According
to the information received, on June 14, 2017, Ms. Fehead was arrested in front
of the Governorate Administration Building in Port Said, at the same time as Mr.
Mahmoud Naguib. They were both held
in detention and Ms. Fehead was interrogated by the Port Said Prosecution from
June 15 to June 18, 2017. She was subsequently charged with numerous offenses
including: “inciting demonstrations”, “disrupting public and
general security”, “disrupting production and citizens’ welfare”, “affecting
public governmental facilities”, “blocking roads and transportation”,
“disrupting traffic”, “attacking people and private and public possessions, and
subjecting them to danger”. 
 
On June 18,
2017, Ms. Fehead and Mr. Naguib were released on a
bail of EGP 10000 (approx. 495 EUR).
 
Their arrests coincide with the June 14,
2017, peaceful protests opposing the transfer of Tiran and Sanafir Islands to
Saudi Arabia[2], that have resulted in the arrest of 60
activists throughout the country[3], including Ms. Fafead and Mr. Naguib. Many
of those arrested were forcibly removed from the street or their homes, while
security forces used excessive force to disperse demonstrators. 
 
The Observatory condemns the arbitrary
detention of Ms. Fehead and Mr. Naguib, as they appeared to be linked to their
human rights activities, and consequently urges
Egyptian authorities to immediately and unconditionally drop the charges
against Ms. Fehead and Mr. Mahmoud Naguib.

 
The Observatory voices its growing concern
over the excessive use force and arbitrary arrests against human rights
defenders exercising their freedoms of speech and peaceful assembly.

[1]                The
April 6 Youth Movement is an Egyptian activist group
established in Spring 2008 to support the workers in El-Mahalla El-Kubra, an
industrial town, who were planning to strike in April 2008. Their core concerns include free speech,
nepotism in government and social justice.


[2]                
The Egyptian House of
Representatives voted on June 14, 2017, to ratify a maritime agreement that
would place the islands of Tiran and Sanafir under Saudi control. In the wake
of the Parliament’s decision, protests erupted throughout several governorates
of the country. On June 20, 2017, Egypt’s highest constitutional court stopped
the transfer agreement.
