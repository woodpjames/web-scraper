The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of
the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation
Against Torture (OMCT), has received new information and requests your urgent
intervention in the following situation in Saudi Arabia.
Description
of the situation:
The
Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the ill-treatment and
harassment of Mr. Waleed Abu Al-Khair, prominent human rights lawyer,
Founder and Director of the Monitor of Human Rights in Saudi Arabia (MHRSA)[1].
Mr. Abu Al-Khair acted as lawyer for human rights defender Raif Badawi.
In 2012, he was awarded the Olof Palme Prize for human rights for his “strong,
self-sacrificing and sustained struggle to promote respect for human and civil
rights for both men and women in Saudi Arabia”.
According
to the information received, on April 18, 2015, Mr. Abu Al-Khair, who faces
continued harassment in prison, lodged a complaint to the prison administration
regarding beatings happened on the same day. To date the complaint has not been
considered.
On
April 21, 2015, as retaliation for lodging the complaint, Mr. Abu Al-Khair, was
beaten, threatened and insulted by another prisoner in Al-Ha’ir rehabilitation
prison in Riyadh, where he has been detained since his transfer from Malaz
prison on February 4, 2015. Later on, policemen came to the cell of Mr. Abu Al-Khair
and threw all his belongings on the ground, searching for prohibited items. 
The
Observatory fears that said harassment stems from Mr. Abu Al-Khair's action for
the respect of the rights of prisoners in prison.
Mr.
Abu Al-Khair was arrested on April 15, 2014 while appearing at the fifth
session of his trial before the Specialized Criminal Court, which deals with
terrorism cases, in Riyadh. On February 15, 2015, the Specialized Criminal
Court of Appeal in Riyadh confirmed a sentence of 15 years in prison, a travel
ban of equal duration following imprisonment, and a fine of SR 200,000
(approximately EUR 46,957). The charges against him were “striving to overthrow
the state and the authority of the King”, “criticising and insulting the
judiciary”, “assembling international organisations against the Kingdom”,
“creating and supervising an unlicensed organisation”, and “contributing to the
establishment of another” and “preparing and storing information that will
affect public security”[2].

Furthermore,
the Observatory recalls that Mr. Abu Al-Khair's sixth transfer since the
beginning of his detention to a prison located approximately 1,000 km away from
his home city came without any warning and after his refusal to recognise the
legitimacy of the trial court and to apologise.
The Observatory is greatly concerned by the arbitrary
detention and allegations of ill-treatment of Mr. Abu Al-Khair, and jointly
with other human rights organisations referred his case to the UN Working Group
on Arbitrary Detention[3].
The Observatory therefore reiterates its calls on the
Saudi authorities to immediately and unconditionally release Mr. Abu Al-Khair,
as his conviction is aimed at preventing him from carrying out his legitimate
human rights activities in Saudi Arabia.  
Actions requested:
Please write to the authorities in Saudi Arabia asking them to:
      i.       
Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity
of Mr. Abu Al-Khair, as well as of all human rights defenders in Saudi Arabia;
     ii.       
Immediately and unconditionally release Mr. Abu Al-Khair, as well as
all human rights defenders arbitrarily detained in Saudi Arabia;
    iii.       
Put an end to all acts of harassment and intimidation, including at the
judicial level, against Mr. Abu Al-Khair and all human rights defenders in
Saudi Arabia, and ensure in all circumstances that they are able to
carry out their work without unjustified hindrance and fear of reprisal;
    iv.       
Conform
with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by
the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its
Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in
association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and
realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and
international levels”, as well as its Article 12.2, which provides that the
State shall “take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the
competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others,
against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse
discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his
or her legitimate exercise of his or her rights”;
     v.       
More
generally, ensure in all circumstances the respect for human rights and
fundamental freedoms in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights, ratify international and regional human rights instruments and
harmonise its domestic law with international human rights instruments.
