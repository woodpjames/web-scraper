The Observatory for the Protection
of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the FIDH (International
Federation for Human Rights) and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT),
requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in Uzbekistan.
 
Description
of the situation:
 
The
Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the arrest and judicial
harassment of human rights activist Mr. Uktam Pardaev, Chairman of the
Djizak regional branch of the Independent Human Rights Society of Uzbekistan
(IHRSU). Mr. Pardaev is a prominent human rights defender known for uncovering
local corruption and monitoring cases of forced labour of adults and children
in Uzbekistan’s cotton fields.
 
According
to the information received, on November 16, 2015 at approximately 6:30 am, Mr.
Pardaev was arrested at his home by ten police officers and a representative of
the prosecutor general’s office. On that occasion, the police confiscated his
computer, a camera, as well as several documents and flash drives, and also
searched his brother's house. Mr. Pardaev was subsequently held incommunicado
for four days in a pre-trial facility of the Dustlik district. On November 20
and 21, 2015, Mr. Uktam Pardaev was finally able to meet his lawyer, but has
not been allowed to see him since. In addition, Mr. Pardaev's family has not
been authorised to visit him since his arrest.
 
On November
18, 2015, Mr. Uktam Pardaev was charged with “fraud” and “bribery” under
articles 168.2 and 211.2 of the Criminal Code, which both carry maximum
sentences of 10 years in prison. 
 
This is
not the first time Mr. Uktam Pardaev has been facing harassment and
restrictions. On October 9, 2015, Mr. Pardaev attended a hearing at the Djizak
City Court, following his complaint about the Uzbek authorities refusal to
grant him an exit visa. The next hearing took place on October 12, 2015 but no
representative of the Immigration Office was present. The judge decided to
close the case and advised Mr. Pardaev to address his complaint to the Ministry
of Internal Affairs, which he did on October 28, 2015.
 
Previously,
on September 30, 2012, during the peak of the cotton harvest, Mr. Pardaev was
arrested by the authorities in Djizak and beaten by several officers. He was
held for over 15 days on administrative charges of “hooliganism” and “resisting
arrest,” before being released. 
 
The
Observatory expresses its deepest concern regarding the ongoing arbitrary
detention and judicial harassment of Mr. Uktam Pardaev, which seem to aim only
at preventing him from carrying out his peaceful human rights activities.
 
The
Observatory calls upon the Uzbek authorities to immediately and unconditionally
release Mr. Pardaev and drop all charges against him as they are clearly aimed
at hindering his human rights activities.
 
Actions
requested:
 
Please write to the authorities of Uzbekistan, urging them to: 
 
i. Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological
integrity of Mr. Uktam Pardaev as well as all human rights defenders in
Uzbekistan;
 
ii.
Release Mr. Uktam Pardaev immediately and unconditionally since his
detention is arbitrary and only aims at sanctioning his human rights
activities;
 
iii. Put
an end to any form of harassment, including at the judicial level, against Mr. Uktam Pardaev,
and drop all charges against him;
 
iv. Comply
with all the provisions of the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights
Defenders, in particular with:
- its
article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in
association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and
realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and
international levels”;
- its
article 6 according to which, “Everyone has the right, individually and in
association with others: a) to know, seek, obtain, receive and hold information
about all human rights and fundamental freedoms, including having access to
information as to how those rights and freedoms are given effect in domestic
legislative, judicial or administrative systems; b) as provided for in human
rights and other applicable international instruments, freely to publish,
impart or disseminate to others views, information and knowledge on all human
rights and fundamental freedoms; c) to study, discuss, form and hold opinions
on the observance, both in law and in practice, of all human rights and
fundamental freedoms and, through these and other appropriate means, to draw
public attention to those matters”. 
- its
Article 12. 2 which states that “The State shall take all necessary measures to
ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually
and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de
facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action
as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in
the present Declaration.“
 
v. Ensure
in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in
accordance with international human rights standards and international
instruments ratified by Uzbekistan.
