New Information:The Observatory has been informed by the Cambodian Centre of Human Rights (CCHR) that criminal complaints against Mr. Kem Sokha, CCHR President, Mr. Pa Nguon Teang, CCHR Deputy Director and Producer of the CCHR Voice of Democracy radio programme, and Mr. Yeng Virak, Director of the Community Legal Education Centre (CLEC), were withdrawn.  According to the information received, on 3 February 2006, government lawyers officially withdrew criminal complaints against Messrs. Kem Sokha, Pa Nguon Teang and Yeng Virak. Prime Minister Hun Sen had requested that lawyers withdraw the government complaints against both men after they wrote letters thanking the Prime Minister for securing their release on bail from prison. The complaints against Mr. Yeng Virak were also withdrawn after they all wrote letters to the Prime Minister Hun Sen, thanking him for their release and withdrawing their earlier comments.  However, under the so-called UNTAC Law adopted in 1992 (Provisions relating to the Judiciary and Criminal Law and Procedure Applicable in Cambodia during the Transitional Period), the withdrawal of a criminal defamation complaint does not mean that the charges are dropped. The judge at the Phnom Penh Municipal Court announced that he would continue to investigate the case against Mr. Kem Sokha, Mr. Pa Nguon Teang and Mr. Yeng Virak. The Prime Minister said publicly that these persons should refrain from acting in an “arrogant” way.  Therefore, a Damocles Sword remains hanged above Mr. Kem Sokha, Mr. Pa Nguon Teang and Mr. Yeng Virak. Under the UNTAC Law, “any accused person, whether or not in detention, must be judged no later than six months after arrest” (Article 21). Background Information:On December 10, 2005, a group of 63 NGOs, including CCHR and CLEC, organised a celebration for the International Human Rights Day with a gathering including booth displays, where participating NGOs displayed their activities and products. Thousands of people participated in the event, which was guarded by police officers and closely monitored by plain-clothes police officers. One of the booths was occupied by CCHR. It was decorated with old banners, which were used in 2003 and had slogans printed in Khmer script: “My vote is my life” and “I don’t vote for any party that sows fear to the people”.  The banners also had handwritings on them, some of which allegedly criticised the policies of Cambodian Prime Minister Mr. Hun Sen. At around 11:00 a.m., CCHR staff members manning the booth were informed by the steering committee that the police authorities had complained about the banners displayed at the stall. Upon receiving this information, CCHR staff members decided to remove the banners.  On December, 31, 2005, Mr. Yeng Virak, member of the organising committee of the International Human Rights Day celebration, was arrested in relation to his role in this celebration on December 10, 2005. Mr. Kem Sokha and Mr. Pa Nguon Teang were respectively arrested on December 31, 2005 and January 4, 2006, also in connection with banners displayed at the International Human Rights Day event. The three men were all charged with defamation and detained at the Prey Sar prison near Phnom Penh.  On January 11, 2006, Mr. Yeng Virak was released on bail.  On January 17, 2006, Mr. Kem Sokha and Mr. Pa Nguon Teang were released on bail as well.  Actions requested: i.
