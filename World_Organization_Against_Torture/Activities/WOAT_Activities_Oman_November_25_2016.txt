The continuing
prosecution and trial of three “Azamn” journalists in Oman has been marked by
procedural flaws and the abuse of punitive press laws, according to a final
Trial Observation Report published by a coalition of human rights groups today.
 
On 07 November
2016, the Omani Appeal Court in Muscat heard the case against three journalists
of “Azamn” newspaper, Ibrahim Al-Maamari, Yousef Al-Haj,
and Zaher Al-Abri. The coalition of rights groups which monitored
the trial was composed of the Gulf Center for Human Rights (GCHR), the Arabic
Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), Front Line Defenders, Reporters
Without Borders (RSF), and both the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH)
and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) within the framework of the Observatory
for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders.
 
The independent
human rights lawyer, who attended the Appeal Court trial on 7 November 2016 in
Muscat, finds that the hearing fell below international fair trial standards.
 
The verdict was
set for 17 November but is now due on 12 December 2016. The coalition therefore
renew its calls for the charges to be dropped and/or for the defendants to be
acquitted. See: http://www.gc4hr.org/news/view/1424
 
The full report
finds, inter alia, that:

Pre-trial
detention of the three defendants in the summer of 2016 was arbitrary and
disproportionate, while conditions in solitary confinement constituted inhuman
and degrading treatment;
There was a failure by the State to afford the defendants timely access to
legal support;
The central charges brought against the defendants act as a broad and
disproportionate tool for state action against the media, offend the principle
of legality and pose a significant obstacle to successfully mounting a fair
defence;
 The
Appeal Court trial failed to remedy the irregularities in the lower Court
hearings.
