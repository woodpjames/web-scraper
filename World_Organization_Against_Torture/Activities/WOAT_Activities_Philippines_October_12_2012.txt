Philippines
October 12, 2012
 
The Observatory for the
Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the World
Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and the International Federation for Human
Rights (FIDH), requests your urgent intervention in the following
situation in The Philippines.
 
Brief
description of the situation:
 
The
Observatory has been informed by Karapatan of the killing of Mr. Gilbert Paborada, an indigenous leader,
in the province of Misamis Oriental, Mindanao, Southern Philippines.
 
According
to the information received, on October 3, 2012, in the afternoon, Mr. Paborada
was shot by two unknown assailants on a motorcycle when he was about to alight
from a tricycle in front of his house in Cagayan de Oro city. According to
witnesses, one gunman shot Mr. Paborada in the head while he was already on the
ground. Mr. Paborada sustained five gunshot wounds and died on the spot.
 
Mr.
Paborada, a member of the Higaonon tribe (one of the 17 Lumad ethnolinguistic
groups) and a resident of Bagocboc village in Opol municipality, was the chair
of Pangalasag (literally meaning “indigenous shield”), a community-based Lumad
organization that is resisting the expansion of a palm oil plantation owned by
the A. Brown Company, a US corporation.
 
Background information:
 
On February 10, 2011,
guards of the A. Brown Company threatened to shoot Mr. Paborada.  In
another incident, another Lumad leader reported that a Brown Company representative,
Mr. Raffy Magbanua, had threatened Mr. Paborada and had ordered him to stop his
campaigns or he would “regret what happens to his life.” In March 2011, following
those incidents, and after local indigenous leaders were also subjected to
surveillance, threats and harassment, Mr. Paborada relocated to Cagayan de Oro
City for safety reasons, but he continued to lead a campaign against the palm
oil plantation from there.  
 
Mr. Paborada reported
those threats to his life to an international fact-finding mission of the
Pesticide Action Network-Asia and the Pacific (PAN-AP), Peasant Movement of the
Philippines and the Kalumbay Regional Lumad organization (Kalumbay). In a
dialogue with Kalumbay held on June 4, Opol Mayor, Mr. Dexter Yasay, claimed
that Mr. Paborada was with the New People’s Army (NPA), an armed opposition
group fighting the Government. The Observatory expresses its concerns at the
fact that public officials may defame the work of human rights defenders and
assimilate them to armed opposition groups, thus seriously endangering their
life in the context prevailing in the Philippines.
 
Actions requested:
 
Please write to the
Philippines authorities urging them to: 
 
Order an immediate, thorough, effective and
     impartial investigation into the assassination of Mr. Gilbert Paborada, in
     order to identify all those responsible, bring them before a civil competent
     and impartial tribunal and apply the penal sanctions provided by the law;
 
Provide adequate reparation and
     protection to Mr. Paborada’s family;
 
Guarantee, in all
     circumstances, the physical and psychological integrity of all human
     rights defenders in The Philippines;
 
Ensure that the government
     representatives at all echelons stop labelling and targeting of human
     rights defenders as “enemies of the state.”
 
 
Comply with all the provisions
     of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted on December 9, 1998
     by the United Nations General Assembly, in particular:
-       
its Article 1, which
states that “everyone has the right, individually or in association with
others, to promote the protection and realization of human rights and
fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, 
-       
its Article 6.a, which
states that "everyone has the right individually and in association with
others to know, seek, obtain, receive and hold information about all human
rights and fundamental freedoms, including having access to information as to
how those rights and freedoms are given effect in domestic legislative,
judicial or administrative systems",
-       
Article 12.1, which
foresees that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with
others, to participate in peaceful activities against violations of human
rights and fundamental freedoms”,
-       
and its Article 12.2
which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the
protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in
association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto
or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a
consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the
present Declaration.”
 
Guarantee
     the respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with
     the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international human
     rights instruments ratified by the Philippines.
