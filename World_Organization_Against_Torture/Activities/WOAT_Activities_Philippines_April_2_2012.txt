The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint 
programme of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and the International 
Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), requests your urgent 
intervention in the following situation in The Philippines.
 
Brief description of the information:
 
The Observatory has been informed by the Alliance for the 
Advancement of People’s Rights (KARAPATAN) of the killing of Mr. Jimmy 
Liguyon, Vice Chair of the indigenous peoples’ group KASILO Lumad[1], belonging to 
the Matigsalog tribe, and Barangay (village) Chair of Dao, San Fernando, 
Bukidnon, Mindanao, southern Philippines. Mr. Liguyon was an indigenous leader and village chief in Bukidnon who steadfastly protected his village from the intrusion of 
destructive mining activities and bio-fuel plantations.
 
According to the information received, on March 5, 2012, at 6:30 pm, Mr. Jimmy Liguyon was shot dead inside his residence by a 
paramilitary group named the New Indigenous People's Army Reform (NIPAR), allegedly led by 
Mr. Alde Salusad a.k.a. Butsoy, who used an armalite 
rifle.
 
According to witnesses, Mr. Salusad allegedly said after the killing: “I killed the captain 
[village chief] because he wouldn’t [join] the SANMATRIDA and refused to give 
certification to SANMATRIDA”. He also warned that whoever complains and fights 
back will also be killed.
 
Subsequently, NIPAR issued a press release in the local media in 
Bukidnon, in which they claimed responsibility for the killing, accusing Mr. 
Jimmy Liguyon of being a supporter of the New People's Army (NPA), the armed 
group of the Communist Party of the Philippines.
 
In the past, NIPAR had pressured Mr. Liguyon to sign the papers that would consequently open Barangay Dao to large-scale mining operations.
 
Indeed, Mr. Liguyon was firmly opposed to the entry of mining companies in his 
village, where the main source of income is small-scale mining. In particular, 
he refused to join the San Fernando Tribal Datus Association (SANMATRIDA), which 
is a group of Lumads that has applied to obtain a Certificate of Ancestral 
Domain Title (CADT) over 52,000 hectares of land in several villages in San 
Fernando, Bukidnon, including Dao, which they have not been able to obtain so 
far as they could not gather all required documents, including the consensus Mr. 
Liguyon refused to sign that would have certified SANMATRIDA as the 
leading organisation of their indigenous community. The SANMATRIDA Multi-purpose Cooperative has been enticing mining 
investors into their domain. The tribal datu of Barangay Dao under the 
SANMATRIDA is a relative of Mr. Salusad, Datu ‘Manayab’ Carillo Salusad.
 
Following Mr. Jimmy Liguyon’s assassination, a blotter was filed at the local police station of San Fernando. A 
case was also filed at the Regional Trial Court and at the Commission on Human 
Rights for investigation. Yet, as of issuing this Urgent Appeal, only the 
Commission on Human Rights had promised to investigate the 
case.
 
The Observatory condemns Mr. Jimmy Liguyon’s extrajudicial killing, as it seems to be a mere reprisal 
for his peaceful human rights activities, as well as the ongoing stigmatisation 
of human rights defenders in The Philippines, who are often labelled by members of the army and the police as being 
sympathetic with, or belonging to, armed leftist groups, including the NPA, 
designated by both the United States and the European Union as a terrorist 
organisation. 
 
In the past, Mr. Jimmy Liguyon had also been pressured by the 
paramilitary group TRIOM Force, for the same reasons.
 
In particular, in October 2011, Mr. Jimmy Liguyon had reported a 
series of harassment and attempts on his life, particularly by Ben Salusad aka 
Nonong, Mr. Alde Salusad’s father, who is associated with the Philippine Army’s 
8th Infantry Battalion, and from the paramilitary group TRIOM Force. 
On October 13, 2011, Mr. Ben Salusad called Mr. Liguyon, and threatened that 
should he go back to Dao, they would kill him. On October 16, Angge Dal-anay, 
another leader of TRIOM Force, went with his group to Mr. Liguyon’s house, but 
the Liguyon family had moved out of Dao after Mr. Salusad’s threats. On October 
28, 2011, Mr. Liguyon and his wife were coming home from a human rights’ day 
rally in Cagayan de Oro City, when they were stopped by armed men led by 
Dal-anay who marched them to a vacant house. Dal-anay told Mr. Liguyon to stop 
joining rallies, and that he should allow mining in Barangay 
Dao.
 
Mr. Liguyon also reported receiving information that Barangay Kagawad 
(village council members) Merlyn Isidro, Medy Mancilla and Fausto Bacliran, 
local buyers of gold in the area through their financier from Davao City and 
Valencia City who were encouraging large scale mining companies to operate in 
their locality, were allegedly planning to kill him through the armed men of 
Nonong Salusad.
