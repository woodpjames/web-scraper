Brief description of the situation The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Humanitarian Law Centre (HLC) that three boys, one of whom has developmental problems, were abused and insulted by four police officers on 9 July 2002. During an illegal search of the boys' home, the police reportedly forced the retarded 15-year-old D. Dj. to dig holes in the yard to uncover firearms allegedly hidden by their father Dragan Djuric, who is currently serving a three-year prison term.  According to the information received, Elizabeta Djuric, the boys' mother, left the family's home in Americ village early that morning for the nearby town of Mladenovac on some administrative business.  At 9 a.m.,  a police car stopped at the gate.  An officer known to the boys as Nebojsa Blagojevic, and three others, two in uniform and one in plain clothes, got out. The plainclothes officer allegedly asked D. Dj. about the weapons.  When the boy replied that he knew nothing, one of the uniformed police said in a threatening tone: "Tell us where the guns are or we'll break you in two.  And after that we'll go to the station and connect you to the electricity."  When S. Dj., one of the brothers, protested the use of the violent words, the officer told him to keep quiet and took D. Dj. behind the house, gave him a spade and ordered him to dig.  One of the policemen allegedly went into the house and used the telephone.  When S. Dj. followed him inside, the officer threatened to beat him if he did not get out immediately.  The officer was in the house for about 45 minutes and S. Dj. saw him opening the refrigerator.  Officer Blagojevic told the youngest brother, an eight-year-old, to take him up to the attic, which he searched and found nothing.  According to the information received, D. Dj. was forced to dig for two hours, with the police shouting at him: "Where are the weapons?  Dig or we'll bury you!"  The boy dug about a dozen holes, some quite deep, and when nothing was found the police left, laughing loudly.  When Elizabeta Djuric returned home, the frightened boys told her what had happened.  On 10 July, she allegedly went to the Belgrade Police Department where she spoke with Inspector Zoran Sekulovic who promised to investigate.  She has heard nothing from the police since then.  The International Secretariat of the OMCT is gravely concerned about the Yugoslav Police’s attitude. Furthermore OMCT would like to recall that Yugoslavia is a party to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which clearly states that: “No child shall be subjected to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment” (art. 37 (a)).   Action Requested  Please write to the Yugoslavian authorities urging them to:  i.	guarantee an immediate investigation into the alleged ill-treatment of the afore-mentioned children, identify those responsible, bring them before a civil competent and impartial tribunal and apply the penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions provided by law; ii.	guarantee adequate reparation to the victims and also physical and psychological recovery; iii.	guarantee all human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards, particularly the Convention on the Rights of the Child.
