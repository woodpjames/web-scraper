The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint 
programme of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World 
Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), has received new information and requests your urgent intervention in 
the following situation in Iran. 
 
New information:
 
The Observatory has been informed by the Iranian League for the Defence of Human Rights 
(LDDHI) of the summons of Dr. Mohammad Maleki to serve a one-year prison term. 
 
According to the information received, on January 23, 2012, Dr. Mohammad Maleki, founding member of the 
Iranian Association for the Defence of Liberty and Human Rights 
(IADLHR)[1], was summoned to Evin prison to serve a one-year prison term (See 
background information) and was given three days to go to prison. He stands a 
high risk of arrest at any time.
 
The Observatory condemns the judicial harassment of Dr. Mohammad Maleki since it seems to merely aim at sanctioning his human rights activities and expresses its deep concern about the ongoing attempts to hinder the peaceful activities of human rights defenders in Iran.
 
Background information:
 
Dr. Maleki spent five years in prison from July 1981 to August 1986 
as a result of his strong objection to the closure of universities. He was also 
arrested on March 12, 2001 and spent more than six months in solitary 
confinement without trial.
 
On August 22, 2009, Dr. Mohammad Maleki was again arrested after the 
presidential election for having boycotted the 2009 presidential election and 
protesting the post-election abuses and spent more than six months in detention 
in Evin prison before being released on bail in March 2010. He was then accused 
of contacts with opposition groups. During his detention, he was hospitalised 
several times owing to a heart attack and other physical problems including 
prostate cancer. He was also reportedly denied access to an adequate 
treatment[2]. 
 
His trial, which was initially scheduled at Branch 28 of the Islamic 
Revolution Court for July 27, 2011, was then re-scheduled to July 30, 2011 due 
to the refusal of the accused to attend the trial[3]. Dr Maleki then attended the court, but refused to defend himself 
and said he would not appeal the sentence, because he considered the court of 
first instance to be illegal. He had initially faced the charge of “moharebeh” 
(fighting God), “insulting the founder of the Islamic Republic Ayatollah 
Khomeini and Ayatollah Khamanei” (the incumbent leader) but was finally 
sentenced on the charge of “propaganda against the system.” 

 
In September 2011, he wrote a brief report to the UN Special 
Rapporteur on Iran on the tortures he 
had suffered during his prison terms and was subsequently interrogated and 
received a notice banning him from travelling abroad. 
 
Actions requested:
 
Please write to the Iranian authorities and ask them 
to:
 
i.         
Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological 
integrity of Dr. Mohammad Maleki as well as that of all human rights defenders 
and their families in Iran;
 
ii.       
 Put an end to any kind of 
harassment - including at the judicial level - against Dr. Mohammad Maleki and 
more generally against all human rights defenders in Iran.
 
iii.      
 Conform in any circumstances 
with the provisions of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted on 
December 9, 1998 by the United Nations General Assembly, in 
particular:
-       its article 1, which states that “everyone has the 
right, individually or in association with others, to promote the protection and 
realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and 
international levels”;
-       its article 5.b, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, 
at the national and international levels, (…) to form, join and participate in 
non-governmental organizations, associations or groups”;
-       its article 12.2 which provides that “the State shall take all 
necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of 
everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, 
threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse 
discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his 
or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present 
Declaration”; 
 
iv.     Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental 
freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and 
international instruments ratified by Iran.

[1] Established 
in 1977, like many other organisations, IADLHR was 
closed down in 1981. Several of its leaders fled Iran and established the 
Iranian League for the Defence of Human Rights (LDDHI) abroad in 1983. 


[2] See 
Observatory Press Release, January 5, 2010.

[3] Mr. Maleki 
published a letter to explain the reasons of his absence. He wrote “I cannot 
attend the trial for the following reasons: in protest to massacres, tortures, 
arrests and sentencing and imprisoning of the students, university professors, 
teachers, women, journalists, lawyers, workers, human rights defenders and other 
compatriots only for expressing their opinions by illegal courts in recent 
years; the court is illegal for failing to comply with Article 168 of the 
Constitution and other constitutional principles; lack of 
possibility to read the indictment issued against me; the respectable judge may 
sentence me in absentia”. Article 168 provides for political and press trials by 
jury.
