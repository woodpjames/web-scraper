To: Permanent
Representatives at the UN Human Rights Council
 
25 September 2013
 
RE: Amendments
proposed by Cuba, Pakistan and the Russian Federation to:
Draft resolution A/HRC/24/L.24 on “Civil society space - Creating and
maintaining, in law and in practice, a safe and enabling environment”, and
Draft resolution A/HRC/24/L.17 on “Cooperation with the United Nations, its
representatives and mechanisms in the field of human rights”
 
Excellencies,
 
Civil society has
an important and legitimate role to play in the promotion and protection of
human rights and should not be subject to intimidation or reprisals for playing
this role.
It is in this
context that the undersigned NGOs urge your government to support the two
abovementioned resolutions and to reject amendments tabled by Cuba, Pakistan
and the Russian Federation.
 
Draft L.24 on civil
society space provides a crucial opportunity for the Human Rights Council to
address the challenges facing States in their efforts to ensure space for civil
society through the convening of a panel discussion in 2014.
 
Draft L.17, better
known as the resolution on reprisals, presents a long overdue response to the
issue of reprisals and intimidation against those who cooperate with the UN
human rights system through, inter alia, the creation of a UN wide focal point
and a call on States to ensure protection of the right to access and
communicate with international bodies in national legislation. 
 
These resolutions
are essential to efforts to promote and protect civil society space, and to
move beyond rhetoric in addressing the issue of reprisals and intimidation
against those who cooperate with the UN human rights system.
 
The proposed
amendments run counter to the spirit and purpose of these important resolutions
and would significantly weaken both the normative and institutional elements of
the texts.
 
The amendments in
question have been tabled by governments that have a history of failure to
support and protect the work of civil society and human rights defenders. We
urge you to demonstrate your government’s respect for the role of civil society
and commitment to the work of human rights defenders, by rejecting the
amendments and supporting the texts as tabled.
 
Yours sincerely,
