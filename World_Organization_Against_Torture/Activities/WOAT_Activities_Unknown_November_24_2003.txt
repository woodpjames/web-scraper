This is done through the submission of alternative reports to the UN Committee Against Torture and the Human Rights Committee, the support for individuals and organizations wishing to challenge torture practices in international legal fora by presenting individual complaints to these Committees, and the publication of a practical guide on international and regional conventional mechanisms and torture.
