Brief description of the situation  The Observatory has been informed by Justice and Peace Brazil that Pastoral Commission on Land coordinator Dionisio Vandresen and his son Romoaldo have received death threats in Parana, Southern Brazil.  According to the information received, Romoaldo Vandresen, the 17 year old son of Dominican Dionisio Vandresen, was attacked by two men armed with revolvers, who threatened to kill him and his father, on April 10th, 2001. In this incident, Romoaldo was followed by a vehicle driven by unknown men, who allegedly forced him to stop, then threatened him with a gun and searched his car. The men then reportedly told Romoaldo to tell his father that they were going to kill him. Romoaldo alleges that he noticed the emblem of the civil police on the guns that were being used to threaten him. According to reports, a woman who witnessed this event was also threatened by the men. This most recent attack follows several other incidents in which the Vandresens have reportedly received death threats by phone and, on one occassion, Romoaldo was harrassed by another vehicle while driving his car.  Mr. Dionisio Vandresen and his son Romoaldo have been active in denouncing the repression of rural farmers without land in Parana, which has most likely led to their receiving death threats.   The Observatory is gravely concerned about the physical and psycholigical integrity of Dionisio and Romoaldo Vandresen. According to the information received, the repression of farmers in Parana has led to 16 deaths, 7 victims of torture, 323 wounded and over 40 attempted killings.  Action requested  Please write to the authorities in Brazil urging them to:  1.	take all necessary measures to guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of Dionisio and Romoaldo Vandresen and put an immediate end to their persecution and harassment;  2.	guarantee an immediate investigation into the circumstances of these events, identify those responsible, bring them before a civil competent and impartial tribunal and apply the penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions provided by law;   3.	to comply with the Declaration on Defenders of Human Rights, in particular, Article 1 which states that "Everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels" as well as article 9, para. 3 and 12;  4.	to generally guarantee the effective respect of fundamental human rights and freedoms in accordance with the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and international and regional human rights instruments ratified by Brazil.
