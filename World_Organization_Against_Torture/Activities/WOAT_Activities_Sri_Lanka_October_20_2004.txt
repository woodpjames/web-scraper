Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Asian Human Rights Commission (AHRC), a member of the OMCT network, of the alleged torture of Mr. Rathnasiri Senadheera in Sri Lanka.  According to the information received, Mr. Rathnasiri Senadheera, a 42 year old, married and father of one child, residing in Akkara 02, Ilambe Junction, Horana was tortured while visiting his brother who was being held in police custody at the time of the incident.   According to the information provided, on 29 September 2004, Mr. Senadheera visited his brother at the Horana Police Station who was already in police custody. Mr. Senadheera spoke with his brother, departed, and soon returned with a lunch box for his detained brother. The Sub Inspector (SI) Saliya told him that he was waiting for him, grabbed him by the neck and dragged him into the police station.  In the station, SI Saliya slammed Mr. Senadheera against the wall several times in front of his detained brother, and struck the victim in the abdomen and chest with his fists for about 15 minutes. A policeman soon intervened asking SI Saliya to stop assaulting Mr. Senadheera. The SI soon halted and the victim was chased away by police about 15 minutes later.   At about 5:15  pm on the same day it is reported that Mr. Shenadheera paid bail for his brother and later admitted himself to the Horana District Hospital where he received treatment for five days being discharged on 5 October 2004.   According to information received, the reasoning behind the assault is reportedly unknown, and there is yet to be any action by the police to inquire about the incident or to punish the responsible.  The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned by this case of  torture. OMCT calls on the authorities to launch a prompt, thorough and impartial investigation into these events, in order to identify those responsible and bring them to justice and award adequate reparation to Mr. Rathnasiri Senadheera.   Actions requested:  Please write to the authorities in Sri Lanka urging them to:   i. take all necessary measures to ensure the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Rathnasiri Senadheera;  ii. order a thorough and impartial investigation into the circumstances of these allegations of torture and/or ill treatment, in order to identify all those responsible, bring them to trial and apply the penal and/or administrative sanctions as provided by law;   iii. guarantee that Mr. Rathnasiri Senadheera be provided with adequate reparation;  iv. guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
