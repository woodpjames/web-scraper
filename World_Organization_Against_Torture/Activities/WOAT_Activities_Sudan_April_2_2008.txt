Brief description of the situation The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Sudan Organisation Against Torture (SOAT), a member of OMCT SOS-Torture network, about the alleged beatings suffered by Mr. Abubkr Mosa Abdalgader, 24 years old riskshaw driver, by four policemen on 22 March 2008 in Port Sudan.  According to the information received, Mr. Abubkr Mosa Abdalgader was beaten in the street by four policemen using the butts of their guns in front of eyewitnesses, causing injuries to his neck and back. Police reported that Mr. Abdalgader had been hitting a boy in the street at the time, though he has not been charged with any crime. According to the same information, Mr. Abubkr Mosa Abdalgader, who would be currently receiving treatment in the Brouot hospital in Port Sudan, was prevented from obtaining a copy of Form 8, necessary in order for a police report to be filed on the incident. Lawyers are reportedly seeking to open a case against the policemen. The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned for the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Abubkr Mosa Abdalgader and urges the Sudanese authorities to guarantee his safety at all times. OMCT further recalls that Sudan is a State party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which prohibits cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. In line with their obligations under this treaty, it is incumbent on the Sudanese authorities to consider seriously any allegations of torture and ill-treatment made by the victim, and to undertake a thorough investigation in this regard. Requested Action Please write to the authorities in Sudan urging them to:   Guarantee, in all circumstances, the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Abubkr Mosa Abdalgader;  Order a thorough and impartial investigation into the allegations of beatings in order to identify all those responsible, bring them to trial and apply the penal and/or administrative sanctions as provided by law;  Guarantee that adequate compensation is awarded to the victim;  Ensure the respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards; in this respect expedite reforms to bring the Sudanese justice system and all legislation into line with the Interim National Constitution and international human rights standards, and to end the impunity of state officials.
