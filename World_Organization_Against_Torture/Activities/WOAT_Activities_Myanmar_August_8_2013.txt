The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of
the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation
Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent intervention in the following
situation in Burma.
 
Brief
description of the situation:
 
The
Observatory has been informed by Burma Partnership about the
arrest, judicial harassment and arbitrary detention of Mr. Ko Htin Kyaw,
leader of the Movement for Democracy Current Force (MDCF), a community-based
organisation which represents grass-roots communities and struggles against
land-grabbing and other human rights violations.
 
According to the information received, on July 30, 2013, Mr. Ko Htin
Kyaw staged a peaceful protest outside the North Oaklapa Court to denounce the
seizure of part of the land of three community members, i.e. Mr. U Lu Aye, Ms.
Ma Sein Htwe and Mr. Ko Myint Naing, by a businessman, Mr. U Eaik Linn. The
three community members also took part in the protest.
 
On August 2, 2013, three
days after the demonstration, the four protesters were summoned to the police
station “for a discussion”. Once on the spot, they were charged under Section
505(c) of the Penal Code for “insulting the State” and immediately sent to
court, which sanctioned their arrest and sent them to Insein prison.
 
Mr. Ko Htin Kyaw and the three community members were denied bail and
face up to three years' imprisonment.
 
The
Observatory condemns the arrest and judicial harassment of the three
above-mentioned community members and of Mr. Ko Htin Kyaw, which seem to merely
aim at sanctioning his peaceful human rights activities.
 
Actions
requested:
 
Please
write to the authorities of Burma, urging them to:
 
i.              
Guarantee in all
circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Ko Htin Kyaw, of
the three above-mentioned community members as well as of all human rights defenders in Burma;
 
ii.             
Release Mr. Ko Htin Kyaw
and the three community members immediately and unconditionally since their
detention is arbitrary as it seems to only aim at sanctioning their human
rights activities;
 
iii.           
Put an end to acts of
any acts of harassment, including at judicial level, against them as well as
against all human rights defenders in Burma;
 
iv.            
Comply with all the
provisions of the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, in
particular with its: 
-       
Article 1, which
provides that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with
others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realization of human
rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”;
-       
Article 6(a), which
foresees that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with
others, to participate in peaceful activities against violations of human
rights and fundamental freedoms”;
-       
Article 12.2, which
provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the
protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in
association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de
facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other
arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the
rights referred to in the present Declaration”;
 
v.             
More generally, ensure
in all circumstances the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in
accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and ratify
international and regional human rights instruments.
