 Women Human Rights Defenders International Coalition (WHRDIC), of which
 OMCT is a member, is a resource and advocacy network supporting
women human rights defenders worldwide. The Women Human Rights Defenders International Coalition is alarmed 
that the Prosecutor General at the Qasr El Nile Prosecution Office in 
Cairo has rejected appeals for lawyer and woman human rights defender 
Azza Soliman to be listed as a witness rather than a defendant in the 
case of Shaimaa ElSabbagh, who was killed while peacefully protesting on
 January 24 2015.
Ms Soliman witnessed the killing of Shaimaa ElSabbagh because she 
happened to be in a restaurant located across the street from the 
incident. She voluntarily gave her testimony at the Prosecution office 
on the night of January 24, 2015 pointing responsibility of the police 
for the death of Shaimaa ElSabbagh.
On March 23 2015, the Qasr El Nile Prosecution Office in Cairo 
changed Ms Soliman’s status from being a witness to the killing of 
Shaimaa ElSabbagh to a defendant being accused of protesting illegally 
and breaching public order and security under the Protest Law #107 of 
2013.
The accusation reflects the continuing security crackdown on human 
rights defenders. In addition to Ms Soliman, Nagwa Abbass and 15 members
 of the member of the Socialist Popular Alliance Party who witnessed the
 killing of Ms ElSabbagh have been charged with unauthorized protesting,
 and breach of security and public order.
