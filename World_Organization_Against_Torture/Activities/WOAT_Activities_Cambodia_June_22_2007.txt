According to the information received, on June 16, 2007, Mr. Lem Piseth was on his way to Kampong Seu, in southern Cambodia, when he received an anonymous call on his cell phone. A man’s voice called him “insolent” and asked him if he “wanted to die”. The man explained that he was insulting the reporter “because of the story about the forest”, and that there would not be “enough land to bury [him] in”. Mr. Piseth tried to call the number back, but could only reach a call centre. These threats follow the publication by Mr. Piseth of four articles on the damage resulting from forest destructions in Kompong Thom province. Following the publication of these articles, Mr. Piseth was also followed by the police and the military, and asked to leave the hotel room he was staying in by the owners, without any explanation. It is worth mentioning that these events take place after the publication of a report on illegal forest destruction in Cambodia, on June 1, 2007, by the NGO Global Witness. On June 3, 2007, this report was banned by the Cambodian authorities and on June 8, 2007, the Cambodian Ministry of Information Mr. Khieu Kanharith further declared that “newspapers [could] refer to [the report] but not reproduce it” (See Urgent Appeal of the Observatory KHM 002/0607/OBS 064, issued on June 7, 2007)”. Yet, Radio Free Asia, like several other media, continued to release news about the report after June 8, 2007, and was ordered to cease any radio broadcasting on this issue by a police official. Mr. Lem Piseth also quoted the report in a radio broadcast. As a consequence of the threats received, Mr. Lem Piseth was obliged to flee abroad. The Observatory expresses its deep concern about these threats against Mr. Lem Piseth, as well as against human rights defenders and civil society in general, as well as the restrictions on their work and the exercise of freedom of expression in Cambodia. Actions required: Please write to the authorities of Cambodia urging them to:  Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Lem Piseth; Put an end to any kind of act of harassment and threats against Mr. Lem Piseth as well as against all human rights defenders in the country;  Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, and article 12.2, which states that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”;  Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance             with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by Cambodia.
