Description of the situation: The Observatory has been informed by the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) about the arbitrary detention of seven trade union leaders and journalists following the issue of a statement by the Gambia Press Union (GPU) calling on President Yahya Jammeh to accept his Government’s responsibility in the 2004 murder of Mr. Deyda Hydara, Editor of The Point, the country’s only independent daily[1]. According to the information received, on June 15, 2009, Ms. Sarata Jabbi-Dibba, Mr. Emil Touray and Mr. Pa Modou Faal, respectively GPU Vice-President, Secretary General and Treasurer, were summoned by the Gambian National Intelligence Agency (NIA) in Banjul for questioning in relation to the statement published by the GPU in The Point and Foroyaa on June 12. They were subsequently arrested. The GPU statement that prompted their arrest criticised Gambian President Yahya Jammeh in relation to comments he had made on June 8 on Government television GRTS, denying any State implication in the murder of prominent Gambian journalist Deyda Hydara, which remains unpunished as of today. The GPU statement also denounced numerous instances of harassment and intimidation of journalists by the Gambian authorities, and deplored the state of media freedom in the country. Furthermore, four other journalists were also arrested by NIA officers in plain clothes on June 15, namely Mr. Sam Sarr, Editor of the opposition newspaper Foroyaa, Mr. Abubacarr Saidykhan, Foroyaa reporter, Mr. Ebrima Sawaneh, The Point News Editor, and Mr. Pap Saine, The Point Managing Editor. Messrs. Ebrima Sawaneh and Mr. Pap Saine are also GPU members. On June 18, 2009, the seven journalists appeared at Kanifing police court and were subsequently charged with “seditious publication”. Messrs. Emil Touray, Pa Modou Fall, Pap Saine and Ebrima Sawaneh, Sam Sarr and Abubakar Saidykhan were then imprisoned in Banjul’s Mile Two jail. Only Ms. Sarata Jabbi-Dibba, mother of a young child, was released on a bail of 200,000 dalasis (about 5, 400 euros). On June 22, 2009, Messrs. Emil Touray, Pa Modou Fall, Pap Saine and Ebrima Sawaneh, Sam Sarr and Abubakar Saidykhan were brought to Kanifing police court in the Banjul suburbs and all were bailed in the sum of 200,000 dalasis (about 5,400 euros). However, all the journalists are due to appear in court again on July 7, 2009 for trial on the “seditious publication” charge. Actions requested: The Observatory urges the authorities of The Gambia to:   Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Ms. Sarata Jabbi-Dibba, Mr. Emil Touray, Mr. Pa Modou Faal, Mr. Sam Sarr, Mr. Abubacarr Saidykhan, Mr. Ebrima Sawaneh and Mr. Pap Saine, as well as all human rights defenders in The Gambia;  Put an end to any kind of harassment, including at the judicial level, against Ms. Sarata Jabbi-Dibba and Messrs.
