The International Secretariat of OMCT has received new information regarding the following situation in Sri Lanka.  Brief reminder of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT was informed by a reliable source of the arrest and disappearance of two children, Priya Sriskantharajah (aged 15) and Vinoth Sriskantharajah (aged 12) along with their mother Mrs. Valarmathy Sriskantharajah (aged 42) (see case LKA 280100) on 25th January 2000, at their home in Urumpirai, by Sri Lankan Police forces who reportedly came with a Militia Group EPDP members (Eelam People’s Democratic Front).  Their father, Mr. Sriskantharajah (aged 45) currently resides in Switzerland having claimed refugee status in 1991.
