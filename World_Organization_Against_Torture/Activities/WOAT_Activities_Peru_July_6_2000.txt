Brief description of the situation:  The OMCT is gravely concerned for the safety and liberty of Miguel Angel Hinostroza Valverde and Primitivo Guerra Infanzon, detained-disappeared since June 29th last in Lima, at the hands of the National Police.  Reports received from the Human Rights Association APRODEH, a member of the OMCT, indicate that in the early morning hours of June 29th Miguel Angel Hinostroza Valverde, his brother, Jhonny Hinostroza Valverde, and Primitivo Guerra Infanzon, were detained by agents of the National Police whom they had photographed while the latter were burning a telephone booth. This incident occurred while a peaceful march was taking place in the vicinity of the Swiss Hotel of San Isidro where members of the High Level Delegation of the Organisation of American States, visiting the country, had their quarters.  After being detained Miguel Angel Hinostroza Valverde, Jhonny Hinostroza Valverde and Primitivo Guerra were put into two police vehicles one of which was described as a grey Nissan Pathfinder Van number plate KL-0489; this was the vehicle into which they put Miguel Angel Hinostroza Valverde.  Mr. Jhonny Hinostroza was taken to the Alfonso Ugarte police delegation, subjected to an interrogation concerning who directed the march, whether he was the leader etc and was released at 10:00 a.m.  However, until yesterday there was no news concerning the whereabouts of Miguel Angel Hinostroza Valverde and Primitivo Guerra Infanzon. The police authorities denied that they had been detained.  Reports recall that in 1990 the father and a sister of Miguel Angel and Jhonny, Sr. Toribio Joaquin Hinostroza Pizarro y Bertha Herlinda Hinostroza Valverde, were detained for presumed contacts with terrorist groups and both continue to belong to the category of disappeared.  On Tuesday July 4th 2000 the APRODEH initiated a Habeas Corpus suit against the Alfonso Ugarte police delegation, the Safety directorate of the State and the DINCOTE (National Directorate against Terrorism). This was accepted and Jhonny Hinostroza was summoned to appear on July 6th to testify before the First Corporative Transitory Court specalised in Public Law.
