Judicial harassment
Zimbabwe
February 17, 2012
 
The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), has received new information and requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in Zimbabwe.
 
New information:
 
The Observatory has been informed by Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights (ZLHR) about the judicial harassment faced by human rights lawyer Alec Muchadehama, who represented several victims of State-sponsored abduction and torture in 2009.
 
According to the information received, on February 15, 2012, Deputy Chief Justice Luke Malaba reserved judgement of an appeal filed by Attorney General (AG) Johannes Tomana requesting the Supreme Court to allow a late appeal[1] by his office against the acquittal of Mr. Alec Muchadehama and Ms. Constance Gambara, a clerk to High Court Judge Justice Chinembiri Bhunu, on charges of “contempt of court” under Section 182 (1) of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act (Chapter 9:23).
 
The Observatory recalls that Mr. Alec Muchadehama’s acquittal refers to charges that were filed against him in 2009 (See background information), and expresses its deep concern about the judicial harassment faced by Mr. Alec Muchadehama since 2009, and fears that it merely aims at sanctioning his human rights activities. Further, the Observatory urges Zimbabwe authorities to put an end to all acts of harassment against human rights defenders. 
 
Background information
 
On May 6, 2009, Mr. Alec Muchadehama, who represented several victims of State-sponsored abduction and torture, including Ms. Jestina Mukoko, Executive Director of the Zimbabwe Peace Project - ZPP) and board member of the Zimbabwe Human Rights Forum, and Mr. Andrison Manyere, freelance journalist, was arrested by officers of the Law and Order Section of the police at the Rotten Row Magistrates Court and accused of “contempt of court”, after having reportedly secured the “unlawful release” on bail of Mr. Manyere and two members of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) who had been granted bail by High Court Judge Justice Charles Hungwe on April 9, 2009, following their abduction by State security agents in 2008[2]. 
 
The State alleged that Mr. Alec Muchadehama “unlawfully and intentionally impaired the dignity, reputation or authority of a court or realising that there was real risk or possibility of impairing the dignity, reputation or authority of a court” by causing the release of the three abductees while he was aware of Justice Bhunu's judgment in which he granted the State leave to appeal against an earlier bail order by Justice Charles Hungwe.
 
On May 15, 2009, he was released on bail after payment of 100 USD (approximately 69,66 euros). Throughout the proceedings, the trial was adjourned, postponed and restarted several times. 
 
On December 10, 2009, Mr. Muchadehama was finally acquitted by the Harare Rotten Row Magistrates Court, as the prosecutors failed to prove the essential elements of the crime, notably as the State did not file its appeal against Justice Hungwe’s order granting bail to Mr. Manyere and the two MDC officials.
 
In 2010, High Court Judge Justice Joseph Musakwa dismissed the AG’s chamber application for leave to appeal against the Magistrates Court’s acquittal of Mr. Muchadehama and Ms. Gambara. Though the AG failed to appeal against Justice Musakwa’s ruling on time, it filed an application for late noting of the appeal.
