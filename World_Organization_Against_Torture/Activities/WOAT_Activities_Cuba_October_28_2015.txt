The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of
the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation
Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent intervention in the following
situation in Cuba.
 
Description
of the situation:
 
The
Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the continued judicial
harassment and arbitrary detention of members of the Patriotic Union of Cuba
(UNPACU) Messrs. Zaqueo Báez Guerrero and Ismael Bonet Reñé as
well as Ms. María Josefa Acón Sardiñas, also member of the Ladies in
White, a peaceful protest group founded by female relatives of Cuban political
prisoners. 
 
According to
the information received, on September 20, 2015, the three human rights
defenders, along with other activists, were arrested while trying to approach
Pope Francis in his car in Havana on his way to the mass he was giving, and
dragged away by security personnel at Havana's Revolution Square. Their
intention was apparently to raise awareness over human rights violations and
the increasing repression against Ladies in White, UNPACU, and other groups in
Cuba. As of issuing this urgent appeal, the three human rights defenders would
still be detained.
 
The
Observatory would like to recall that these arbitrary detentions are part of
genuine wave of political and social repression that led to several “preventive
detentions”[1] that took place around
Pope Francis' visit, and at least 882 in September, as denounced by Cuban human
rights organisations. Activists have been arrested and detained by the
authorities to prevent them from attending papal ceremonies. 
 
The
Observatory urges the Cuban authorities to immediately and unconditionally
release Messrs. Zaqueo Báez Guerrero, Ismael Bonet Reñé and Ms. María
Josefa Acón Sardiñas as well as all human rights defenders currently held in
detention, since their detention only aims at sanctioning their human rights
activities aimed at protecting and defending freedom of expression.
 
The
Observatory more generally calls upon the Cuban authorities to put an end to
the continuing harassment, including at the judicial level, against the above-mentioned
human rights defenders and to protect and respect the right to freedom of
expression.

Actions requested:
 
Please write
to the authorities of Cuba asking them to:
 
i. Put an
end to all forms of harassment, including at the judicial level, against
Messrs. Zaqueo Báez Guerrero, Ismael Bonet Reñé and Ms. María Josefa
Acón Sardiñas as well as of all human rights defenders in the country;
 
ii.
Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of
Messrs. Zaqueo Báez Guerrero, Ismael Bonet Reñé and Ms. María Josefa
Acón Sardiñas as well as of all human rights defenders in Cuba;
 
iii. Comply

Defenders, adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 9, 1998, in particular
with:
 
article 1, which states that
     "everyone has the right, individually or collectively, to promote the
     protection and fulfilment of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the
     national and international levels", 
 
article 6(a), which foresees
     that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others,
     to participate in peaceful activities against violations of human rights
     and fundamental freedoms”;, 
 
as well as article
     12.2, which provides that "the State shall take all necessary
     measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of
     everyone, individually or in association with others, against any
     violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse
     discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of
     his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present
     Declaration";
 
iv.
