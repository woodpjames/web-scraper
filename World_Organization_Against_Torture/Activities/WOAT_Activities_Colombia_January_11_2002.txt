Brief description of the situation:  The International Secretariat of the OMCT has been informed by reliable sources of the assassination of the university leader Marcos Salazar Prado, and of the increasing concerns for the security and physical and psychological integrity of Dr. Estela Cepeda Vargas, in Pasto, department of Nariño.  According to the information obtained from the Foundation Committee of Solidarity with the Political Prisoners (Fundación Comité de Solidaridad con los Presos Políticos -FCSPP), student Marcos Salazar Prado was assassinated on January 7, 2002 at approximately 1:00 p.m., by unknown individuals. Using firearms, the offenders shot on repeated occasions, while his daughter was present.   The reports state that Mr. Marcos Salazar Prado was the father of two children, and was soon to finish his degree in civil engineering. He was, additionally, the student representative for the council of the University of Nariño, and member of the Colombian Association of University Students (ACEU). Mr. Salazar Prado had been the subject of prolonged harassment, and his family had been previously threatened. Furthermore, Mr. Salazar Prado’s father was subject of an attack on September 2001, in Tumaco from which he did not suffered any injuries. According to the information received, the state authorities had been already informed of the threats to Mr. Salazar Prado’s life, as he himself had requested protection to the Minister of Interior on August 15, 2001. Likewise, the university had requested the provision of protection, however this was never fulfilled.  This case, the report adds, is reminiscent of previous cases of assassination in Pasto, those of Ms. Adriana Benítez , a student leader of the same university (see appeal OMCT, case COL 171000); of the religious woman Yolanda Cerón (see appeal Observatory COL 014/0109/OBS 076); and of the journalist for the newspaper Voz, Flavio Bedoya,  in Tumaco. All of them were committed fighters for peace in their region and were repeatedly threatened before they were killed.   Numerous human rights organizations are deeply concerned for the security and physical and psychological integrity of Dr. Estela Cepeda Vargas, member of the political party Patrotic Union (U.P.).  Dr. Cepeda Vargas has been victim of numerous death threats. The protection mechanisms provided by the Police which Dr. Cepeda Vargas previously enjoyed, have been, for reasons ignored by the sources, recently stopped.  According to the reports, Dr. Cepeda Vargas has now been object to strict vigilance from unknown actors. Since September 3, 2001 unidentified vehicles have circled Dr. Cepeda Vargas’ house, and have followed her in some occasions.  Dr. Cepeda Vargas’ brother, Manuel Cepeda Vargas, was assassinated on August 1994. The investigation conducted following his death resulted in the implication of several members of the Colombian army. Mr. Cepeda Vargas was a member of the Colombian Congress and leader of the Patriotic Union.   The International Secretariat of the OMCT, as well as other human rights organizations, take into account the fact that the members and activists of the U.P. have been consistently considered by the Colombian security forces and paramilitary groups as sympathizers and collaborators of the guerrillas.  More than three thousand members of this political party have been assassinated since the party’s creation in 1985.   The OMCT shares the concerns of the Foundation Committee of the Political Prisoners (FCSPP) and other human rights organizations, for the security and integrity of Dr. Cepeda Vargas, and condemns the assassination of the university leader Mr. Marcos Salazar Prado. Likewise, it condemns the persecution of members of the civil society, the apparent impunity of the authors of human rights violations, and the absence of effective measures from the regional and national authorities that prevent these events.  Action requested:  Please write to the Colombian authorities urging them to :  i.	take immediate action to guarantee the security and physical and psychological integrity of Dr. Estela Cepeda Vargas, as well as that of the members of her family;  ii.	take immediately all the necessary precautions to guarantee the security and integrity of Mr. Salazar Prado’s family members, as well as that of other students, professors and workers of the university of Nariño;   iii. 	order an immediate and impartial investigation of the circumstances described above, in order to identify those responsible, take them to justice and apply the necessary penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions as accorded by the law;  iv.	carry out immediately all the recommendation given by the international organizations and the regional human rights associations, including the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Commission for Human Rights of the United Nations, and the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights, as well as other non-governmental organisations;  v.	guarantee the respect for human rights and fundamental liberties throughout the country, in accordance with the national law and the international human rights norms.
