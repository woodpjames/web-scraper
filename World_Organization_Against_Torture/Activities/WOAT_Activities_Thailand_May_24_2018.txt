The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights
Defenders, a partnership of FIDH and the World Organisation Against Torture
(OMCT), requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in Thailand.
 
Brief description of the situation:
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources
about the arbitrary arrest, detention, subsequent release and judicial
harassment of 15 pro-democracy activists, including Democracy Restoration Group
(DRG) leader Mr. Rangsiman Rome, Mr.
Sirawit Seritiwat, Mr. Piyarat Chongthep, Ms. Chonthicha Jangrew, human rights lawyer
Mr. Anon Nampa, Ms. Nuttaa Mahattana, human rights activist
and former lèse-majesté detainee Mr. Ekachai
Hongkangwan, Mr. Chokchai
Pairatchata, Mr. Nikorn Wittayaphan,
Mr. Wiset Sangkhawisit, Mr. Putthaising Pimchan, Mr. Khiri Khanthong, Mr. Wirote Trongngamrak, and two other male activists who wish
to remain anonymous.
 
According to the information received, at
approximately 3:30 pm on May 22, 2018, Mr. Anon Nampa, Ms. Chonthicha Jangrew, Ms.
Nuttaa Mahattana, Mr. Ekachai Hongkangwan, Mr. Chokchai Pairatchata, Mr. Khiri Khanthong,
Mr. Putthaising Pimchan, Mr. Wirote Trongngamrak, and two men were arrested near
the United Nations (UN) building complex in Bangkok, during a pro-democracy
demonstration to mark the fourth anniversary of the latest military coup in
Thailand. The ten were taken into custody at the Phaya Thai police station.
 
Shortly afterwards during the same protest, Messrs. Rangsiman
Rome, Sirawit Seritiwat, Piyarat Chongthep, Wiset Sangkhawisit, and Nikorn
Wittayaphan were arrested near Thammasat University’s Tha Phrachan Campus in
Bangkok and taken to the Chana Songkhram police station.
 
The 15 pro-democracy activists were charged by police under
Article 116 of the Thai Criminal Code (‘sedition’), Article 12 of the Head of
the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO) Order 3/2015 (which bans
political gatherings of five or more people), Articles 215 and 216 of the
Criminal Code (‘assembly of more than ten people threatening acts of violence’
and ‘refusal to comply with an official order to disperse’, respectively), and Article
108 of the Road Traffic Act (‘obstruction of traffic’).
 
The 15 human rights defenders were detained at the two
police stations for 48 hours before being transported to the Ratchada Criminal
Court in Bangkok on May 24, 2018. On the same day, after initially agreeing to
a police request for a further 12-day pre-trial detention, the court ordered
the release of the 15 human rights defenders, with bail set at 100,000 baht
(approximately 2,600 Euros) each, on condition that they do not engage in any political
activities.
 
The Observatory recalls that the Thai authorities have
a long record of judicial harassment against Mr. Rangsiman Rome[1],
Mr. Sirawit Seritiwat[2],
and Mr. Anon Nampa[3]. 
 
The Observatory condemns the arbitrary arrest, detention,
and judicial harassment of Mr. Rangsiman Rome, Mr. Sirawit Seritiwat, Mr. Piyarat
Chongthep, Ms. Chonthicha Jangrew, Mr. Anon Nampa, Ms. Nuttaa Mahattana, Mr. Ekachai
Hongkangwan, Mr. Chokchai Pairatchata, Mr. Nikorn Wittayaphan, Mr. Wiset
Sangkhawisit, Mr. Putthaising Pimchan, Mr. Khiri Khanthong, Mr. Wirote
Trongngamrak, and two other pro-democracy activists.
 
The Observatory expresses concern over the ongoing trend
of repression of freedom of peaceful assembly and freedom of association in
Thailand[4].
The Observatory urges the Thai authorities to put an end to all forms of harassment,
including at the judicial level, against the 15 human rights defenders, which
seems only aimed at punishing them for their peaceful and legitimate human
rights activities.
