New information: The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources of the sentencing to one year in prison and subsequent detention of Mr. Emadeddin Baghi, a journalist involved in the defence of human rights. According to the information received, on October 14, 2007, Mr. Baghi was condemned by a Security Court in Tehran to one year in prison. He was accused of disclosing through his association, the Society for Defending Prisoners’ Rights, secret information obtained from prisoners detained in security prisons, for which he was recently heard three times by the judge. According to the information received, a bail was firstly set for his release but the judge ordered that Mr. Baghi be conducted to Evin prison, as he had a one-year sentence to serve from a previous conviction in 2003[1].  The Observatory expresses its deepest concern over the constant repression of human rights defenders in Iran, and considers Mr. Baghi’s detention as arbitrary as it merely aims at sanctioning his activities in favour of human rights in Iran. The Observatory further fears that he might be subjected to ill-treatment while in detention. The Observatory further wishes to recall that Iran had committed to “uphold the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights” by presenting its candidacy to the Human Rights Council 2006 election and insisted in this regard on the fact that the country had “continuously put great efforts into safeguarding the status and inherent dignity of the human person as well as the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms”[2]. In order to ensure the continuation of these efforts, the Observatory strongly urges the Islamic Republic of Iran to conform with international human rights standards. Background information: The Observatory recalls that Mr. Baghi has been subjected to repeated acts of harassment due to his human rights activities over the past years. In particular, Mr. Baghi was detained from 2000 to 2003 for “attacking national security” in relation to articles he had written on human rights and against the death penalty. Moreover, his passport was confiscated on October 4, 2004, on the eve of his travel to Montreal, where he had planned to participate in the 2nd World Congress Against Death Penalty which was held from October 6 to 9, 2004. He had been banned from leaving the country since then and was accordingly prevented from going to France in December 2005 in order to receive the Human Rights Prize which had been awarded to him by the French National Consultative Commission on Human Rights (Commission nationale consultative des droits de l’Homme - CNCDH)[3]. On July 31, 2007, Mr. Baghi was condemned by the Tehran Revolutionary Court for articles he had written in the Jomhouriat newspaper, of which he had been the editor-in-chief until it was closed down by the authorities in September 2004. The articles called for the defence of persons who were sentenced to death in the southern Khozestan region. He was condemned for “activities against national security” and “publicity in favour of the regime’s opponents”. On the same day, his wife and his daughter were given three-year suspended prison sentences and five years of probation for “meeting and colluding with the aim of disrupting national security”, after taking part in a series of human rights workshops in Dubai in 2004. Mr. Baghi, his wife and his daughter have appealed their sentence.
