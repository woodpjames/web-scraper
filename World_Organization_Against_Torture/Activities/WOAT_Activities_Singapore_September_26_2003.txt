Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the People's Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL), a member of the OMCT network, of the case of Arun Prakash Vaithilingam, a 25 years old Indian national, who has been scheduled to be executed on October 3rd, 2003 in Singapore.  According to the information received, Mr. Vaithilingam, a migrant worker who had been living in Singapore since December of 2000, was convicted by a Singapore court in December of 2002 for the murder of his room-mate in December 2001.   In the evening of December 22 2001, Mr. Arun Prakash Vaithilingam stabbed his room-mate during a drunken argument. Eyewitness testified to the fact Arunprakash Vaithilingam and several of the persons present immediately took the wounded man to the hospital.  Arun Prakash Vaithilingam has stated that that he did not intend to stab his room-mate and that he had not immediately realized that he had done so.   Nevertheless, the Singapore High Court convicted Mr. Arun Prakash Vaithilingam for murder. In Singapore the death penalty is mandatory for murder.  OMCT considers the death penalty to be a violation fo the right to life and the ultimate form of cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment.   The International Secretariat of OMCT therefore calls upon the authorities to immediately commute the death sentence handed down to Mr. Arun Prakash Vaithilingam.  Action requested  Please write to the authorities in Singapore urging them to:  i.	take all necessary measures to guarantee Mr. Arun Prakash Vaithilingam’s physical and psychological integrity; ii.	immediately commute Mr. Arun Prakash Vaithilingam’s death sentence; iii.	guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
