accountability stronger than ever
 
Geneva, 7 February 2011.
‘The
cancellation of the visit is a stark reminder that the quest for legal
accountability for the US torture policy will not simply go away’, said Eric Sottas, Secretary
General of the OMCT.
‘It
shows that the legal case against George W Bush for acts of torture is just too
solid to be dismissed’ and that ‘countries around the world with an independent
legal system cannot anymore guarantee to President Bush and those responsible
for the torture policy not to be arrested or prosecuted in the future.’
The
OMCT had sent an open letter to the Swiss authorities last week outlining their
legal obligations to open a criminal investigation in case of the visit (see
link below).
The
OMCT voiced its surprise over press comments of Swiss Justice Ministry
officials suggesting a continuous head of state immunity for acts of torture even
after his term of office.
‘Let
us be clear, this reasoning is fundamentally flawed and does not hold legal
scrutiny’, said the OMCT in a preliminary comment. It recalls a series of legal
precedents in which former head of states were charged with acts of torture
under the UN Convention Against Torture – a position to which Switzerland
never objected.
