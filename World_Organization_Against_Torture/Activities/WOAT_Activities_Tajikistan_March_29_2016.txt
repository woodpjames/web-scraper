The chart attached provides an overview of priority
concerns relating to torture, ill-treatment and impunity in Tajikistan. It also
cites key recommendations made by the United Nations (UN) Committee against
Torture (CAT), the Human Rights Committee (HRC) and the Special Rapporteur on Torture (SR) since Tajikistan was considered in the first cycle of the
Universal Periodic Review (UPR) in 2011. In addition, it
identifies a number of questions that we kindly ask Government delegations to
raise during the interactive dialogue and a list of suggested recommendations
aimed at addressing the most pressing concerns. The document was jointly issued
by the NGO Coalition against Torture in Tajikistan, International Partnership
for Human Rights (IPHR, Belgium), Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights (HFHR,
Poland) and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT). For more detailed
