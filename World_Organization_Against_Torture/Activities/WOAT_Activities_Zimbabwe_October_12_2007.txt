Michael Kandukutu, Justice Mucheni and Tennyson MuchepfaNew information ZWE 006 / 0907 / OBS 117.1 End of judicial proceedings Zimbabwe October 12, 2007 The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), has received new information and requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in Zimbabwe. New information: The Observatory has been informed by the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) about the dismissal of charges against three members of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU), namely Messrs. Michael Kandukutu, Justice Mucheni, also a member of the Food Federation, and Mr. Tennyson Muchepfa, also a member of the National Engineering Workers’ Union (NEWU). According to the information received, on October 5, 2007, Messrs. Michael Kandukutu, Justice Mucheni, and Tennyson Muchepfa appeared before a court in Harare, which ruled that the three had not committed any offence and that there was “no reasonable suspicion” that they had committed any crime. The court added the three were distributing information that was public knowledge. The Observatory recalls that Messrs. Michael Kandukutu, Justice Mucheni, and Tennyson Muchepfa had been arrested on September 17, 2007 in Harare, while trying to distribute fliers for a peaceful stay away due to take place on September 19 and 20 in order to protest against the devastating consequences of hyperinflation and mass unemployment on their members. They had been released on a bail of Z$ 500,000 on September 19, 2007 after appearing in Court and remained accused of “criminal nuisance” under Section 46 of the Zimbabwean Criminal Code. According to the information received, the ZCTU members were allegedly assaulted by police officers before being taken to Mbare police station where they were further assaulted. They were then transferred to Harare Central police station. The Observatory welcomes the dismissal of charges against Messrs. Michael Kandukutu, Justice Mucheni, and Tennyson Muchepfa and wishes to thank all the persons, organisations, and institutions that intervened in their favour. Background information: In the run-up of the “stay away”[1] that was due to take place on September 19 and 20, 2007, several members of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) and of the Women of Zimbabwe Arise (WOZA) were arrested, detained and harassed for their involvement in the organisation of the event. On September 13 and 14, 2007, three ZCTU members, Messrs. Eliot Muposhi, Willmore Makure and Tafara Tawengahama, were arrested in Masvingo and taken to the police station of the city where they were interrogated by police officers from the Law and Order section and members of the Central Intelligence Organisation, concerning the planned ZCTU stay away. After a three hours interrogation, the three were released but threatened with reprisals if they went ahead with the stay away. In Bulawayo, on September 18, 2007, Mr. Isaac Teveteve, the Secretary of the Gweru branch of the ZCTU, was arrested and sent to detention in Gweru, before being released a few hours later. On the same day, three WOZA members, Ms. Magodonga Mahlangu, Ms. Rosemary Siziba and Ms. Sitshiyiwe Ngwenya were arrested and taken to the Bulawayo police station where they were charged under the Criminal Codification Act for “malicious damage to property owned by the State”. The charges relate to messages reading “choose love over hate” that have been written on roads around Bulawayo. Ms. Mahlangu was reportedly removed from Bulawayo police station and brought to a police station located 30 kilometres away from the city. While she was in detention, Law and Order officers subjected her to intensive interrogations and threatened her with death. The three activists were then brought to court on September 19, 2007, where lawyers facilitated their release.
