URGENT APPEAL - THE OBSERVATORY

SYR 002 / 0311 / OBS 033
Sentencing to prison / Arbitrary
detention
Judicial harassment 
Syria
March 14, 2011
The Observatory for the Protection
of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the International Federation
for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT),
requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in Syria.
Description of the situation: 
The Observatory has been informed
by reliable sources about the sentencing to prison of Mr. Ali Saleh
Al-Abdallah, writer and member of the National Council of the Damascus
Declaration for Democratic National Change (NCDD), a collective pro-democracy
movement calling for peaceful democratic reforms in Syria. 
According to the information
received, on March 13, 2011, Mr. Ali Saleh Al-Abdallah was sentenced by the
Second Military Criminal Court in Damascus to three years of imprisonment, for
“spreading false and exaggerated news that weaken national sentiments” and
“spoiling Syria's relations with another country” under Article 278 of the
Criminal Code for a statement made to a news agency from his prison cell
criticising human rights violations during Iran's 2009 presidential election.
He will serve a sentence of one year and a half due to the credit for the time
already served prior to the decision.
The Observatory expresses its
deepest concern about the sentencing of Mr. Ali Saleh Al-Abdallah and his
ongoing arbitrary detention, which seems to merely aim at sanctioning his human
rights activities. 
The Observatory further fears for
Mr. Ali Saleh Al-Abdallah's physical and psychological integrity and calls upon
the Syrian authorities to take prompt action in order to immediately and
unconditionally release him, as well as all human rights defenders presently
detained in the country. This condemnation illustrates once more the extreme
harassment faced by human rights defenders in Syria 
Background information
On December 17, 2007, Mr. Ali Saleh
Al-Abdallah was arrested and on October 29, 2008, he was sentenced to two years
and a half of imprisonment, together with 11 other leaders of the NCDD on
charges of “spreading false and exaggerated news that weaken national
sentiments” under Article 286 of the Criminal Code . 
On June 17, 2010, instead of being
release, Mr. Al-Abdallah was transferred into military jurisdiction and new
charges were brought against him allegedly for making a press statement from
inside the prison regarding Iranian elections in 2009. Since then, he is held
in the Central Damascus Prison of Adra. 
Actions requested:
Please write to the Syrian
authorities, urging them to: 
i. Guarantee in
all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Ali Saleh
Al-Abdallah;
ii. Ensure the
immediate and unconditionally release of Mr. Ali Saleh Al-Abdallah since his
detention is arbitrary as it only aims at sanctioning his human rights
activities;

any acts of harassment, including at the judicial level, against Mr. Ali Saleh
Al-Abdallah and more generally against all human rights defenders in Syria; 
iv. Conform with

realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and

fundamental freedoms and [...] to study, discuss, form and hold opinions on the
observance, both in law and in practice, of all human rights and fundamental
freedoms and, through these and other appropriate means, to draw public
attention to those matters”.
- and its Article 12.2, which provides that “the State shall take all
necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of
everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence,
threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or
any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise
of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”;
