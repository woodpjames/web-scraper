ESCR Economic, Social and Cultural Rights Killings related to a land conflict   The International Secretariat of OMCT requests your URGENT intervention in the following situation in Brazil.   Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by a reliable source that seven rural workers and a 'fazendeiro' (landowner) have been killed on September 19, 2003 180 kilometres away from the town of São Feliz dos Xingu, Para State, Brazil.  According to the information received, on September 12, 2003, heavily armed private security guards from the Primavera Farm killed the rural workers Justino Pereira da Silva, Antônio da Conceição, Pedro Formiga, Elizeu, Maurício, Penteado and Baixinho Moreno, along with 'fazendeiro' (landowner) Antônio Vieira da Silva. The killing reportedly took place after lunch in a house located on the premises of the Terra do Meio Farm.   The house where the killing took place is reportedly located in the neighbourhood of the Primavera Farm, which is owned by Tadeu Bitar. According to a witness who survived the killing, the private security guards from the Primavera Farm threatened the victims with death the day before the killing. It is reported that the killing was related to a land conflict between Antônio Vieira da Silva and Tadeu Bitar.   Reports highlight that the police took a long time to reach the place where the killing took place and that they had to borrow the vehicle of a third party to eventually reach it.   Two victim’s bodies have been sent to Belém for an autopsy and the witness is reportedly under the protection of the police.    Background information  The killing of the seven rural workers and the 'fazendeiro' (landowner) took place in a region known as Iriri, which is located between the rivers of Iriri and Xingu, where grave cases of violence occur on a regular basis and are notably related to land conflicts.   Since January 2003, a total of 21 rural workers have been assassinated in the Para State, including the seven rural workers who were killed on September 12, 2003. These killings put Para State in first place in terms of the number of rural workers who have been assassinated in 2003. Overall, in most cases of rural workers’ assassinations, the police remain reluctant in carrying out impartial and independent inquiries, in clarifying the causes of the assassinations and in apprehending those responsible. While between 1971 to 2002 a total of 726 assassinations of rural workers took place in the Para States, only 5 trials took place and only 7 condemnations were headed out.    Action requested  Please write to the authorities in Brazil urging them to:  i.	guarantee an immediate investigation into the circumstances and causes of these assassinations, identify those responsible, bring them before a competent and impartial tribunal and apply the penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions provided by law;  ii.	guarantee adequate reparation to the victims’ families;  iii.	guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms, including economic, social and cultural rights throughout the country in accordance with international human rights standards.
