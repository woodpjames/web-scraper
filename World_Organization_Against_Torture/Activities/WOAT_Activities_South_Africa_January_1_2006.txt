Action against torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment can best be undertaken in light of the root causes affecting the whole spectrum of violence, from domestic and community violence to the extremes of torture and other forms of ill-treatment that are directly within the Committee’s mandate. It also seeks to respond to the call by the High Commissioner for Human Rights “…for further efforts to promote integrated strategies for the promotion and protection of human rights, moving away from a rigid categorization of rights to a comprehensive understanding that can better achieve improvements in the enjoyment of all human rights by all."[1]      [1] Ms. Louise Arbour, Preface Attacking the Root Causes of Torture: Poverty, Inequality and Violence, An Interdisciplinary Study OMCT Geneva 2006
