Brief Description of the Situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Alliance for the Advancement of People’s Rights (KARAPTAN), a member of the OMCT network, of the extra-judicial killing of three members of a family, namely Mr. Ellasar Monsalud (48), Mrs. Concepcion Monsalud (39) and Charlie Monsalud (10) on December 4th, 2004, by 6 armed men, among whom 5 were wearing military uniforms.   According to the information received, on December 4th at 4:30 am, the armed men shot and killed these three persons at their home in Purok 3, Lower Calabat, Josefina, Zamboanga del Sur. Only one member of the family, namely the eldest daughter Cheryl, who at the time was in a scout camp at the Josefina Elementary School was spared. The bodies of all the three killed persons bore many gunshot wounds.   It is reported that the couple was formerly member of the rebel group which operated in the Lanao del Norte area, but that they had stopped their activities since 2001. On November 6th, 2004, Mr. Ellasar Monsalud had come across a soldier who had recognized him as a former rebel. Following this encounter, the family had noticed that they were pursued by the soldier. On November 10th, 2004 the couple decided to surrender to the police in Josefina, hoping that this would help them clear their name and avoid further harassment. They were then brought to the Tabak 1st Infantry Division, Philippines Army in Pulacan, Labangan, Zamboanga del Sur. However, they allegedly found out that no cases had been filed against them nor any arrest warrant issued.   OMCT is deeply concerned by this grave case of extra-judicial killing. Moreover, OMCT would like to recall the Philippines that under article 6 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child “States Parties recognize that every child has the inherent right to life” and “States Parties shall ensure to the maximum extent possible the survival and development of the child”.  OMCT calls on the authorities in the Philippines to take all the measures necessary to prevent extra-judicial killings. In this particular case OMCT urges on the authorities to ensure that those responsible are identified and punished by appropriate penalties provided for by law.    Requested Action: Please write to the authorities in Philippines urging them to:  i. order a thorough and impartial investigation into the circumstances of these extra-judicial killings, in order to identify all those responsible, bring them to trial and apply to them the civil, penal and/or administrative sanctions provided by law;   ii. guarantee that adequate reparation is awarded to the victims’ family;  iii. guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
