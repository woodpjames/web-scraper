Description of the situation: The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the sentencing of two journalists of the State-controlled press, Mr. Nguyen Van Hai of Tuoi Tre (Youth Magazine) and Mr. Nguyen Viet Chien of Thanh Nien (Young People). According to the information received, on October 15, 2008, Messrs. Nguyen Van Hai and Nguyen Viet Chien were condemned by the Vietnam’s Hanoi People’s Court for “abusing democratic freedoms to infringe upon the interests of the State”, pursuant to Article 258 of the Criminal Code, after they covered a major corruption scandal at Vietnam’s Transport Ministry involving several high-ranking Communist officials[1]. Mr. Nguyen Van Hai was sentenced to two years of prison and Mr. Nguyen Viet Chien was sentenced to a two year re-education term, suspended for time served, after he pleaded guilty. Both had been arrested on May 12, 2008, two months after one of the main accused in the corruption scandal was cleared of all charges and released due to the alleged “lack of evidence”. As of issuing this urgent appeal, no further information could be gathered on Mr. Nguyen Van Hai’s place of detention. The Observatory expresses its deepest concern with this blatantly unfair decision, which attempts to punish human rights defenders for exercising their right to freedom of expression and aims at silencing them. Moreover, the Observatory expresses its deepest concern over these worrying acts targeting human rights defenders in Viet Nam, and considers it as clear evidence of the ongoing determination of the Vietnamese authorities to strike down any dissenting voice in the country. Action requested: Please write to the authorities in Viet Nam urging them to:   Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Nguyen Van Hai and Mr. Nguyen Viet Chien;  Release Mr. Nguyen Van Hai immediately and unconditionally as his deprivation of liberty is arbitrary since it only seems to sanction his human rights activities;  Put an end to all acts of harassment, including at the judicial level, against all Vietnamese human rights defenders;  Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, and Article 12.2, which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”;  More generally, ensure in all circumstances the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with international and regional human rights instruments ratified by Viet Nam.
