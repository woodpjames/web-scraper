The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of
the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and the International Federation
for Human Rights (FIDH) requests your urgent
intervention in the following situation in The Philippines.
New information:
The
Observatory has
been informed by reliable sources about ongoing threats, harassment,
intimidation and surveillance suffered by Ms. Honey May Suazo, Secretary General of the Southern Mindanao
Regional Chapter of the Alliance for the Advancement of People’s Rights
(Karapatan). Ms. Suazo has undertaken several fact-finding missions mostly in
highly militarised communities and on several occasions has openly denounced
the human rights violations committed by military troops in the Southern
Mindanao Region.
According
to the information received, on July
11, 2015, Ms. Suazo learnt that the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group
(CIDG) had filed a trumped up criminal case before the City Prosecutor’s Office
on May 12, 2015, against her and 15 other leaders of civil society
organisations supporting individuals forced to flee their homes due to military
presence in the region of Talaingod, Davao del Norte Province. 
Ms.
Suazo has been subjected in the past to harassment, threats and surveillance
due to her activities as a human right defender.
On June 19, 2015, another Karapatan staff member, Ms. Leonora Ricafort, had called Ms. Suazo
to warn her not to go to the office due to the presence of three men monitoring
the premises. 
Since then, Ms. Suazo has not returned to the
Karapatan office, nor to her home.
Earlier this year, on February 7, Ms. Suazo and four other human rights
defenders were coming back from a meeting about human rights violations
perpetrated against evacuees from Talaingod, when they realised that a man was
following them on a motorcycle. The five human rights defenders immediately
tried to call a taxi, while the man kept standing on his motorcycle just one
meter away from them, staring at Ms. Suazo and apparently holding something in
the pocket of his jacket.
The Observatory expresses its
deepest concern over the ongoing acts of harassment and surveillance faced by
members of the Karapatan office in Southern Mindanao Region from the military.
The latter have even been labelled by the military as “enemies of the state”
and “front organisations of the communists”, in a context of intensification of
military operations, especially in Mindanao, where 60% of troops from the Armed
Forces of the Philippines are deployed under the counter-insurgency programme
Oplan Bayanihan.
The Observatory calls upon the
Philippine authorities to to immediately put an end to any form of harassment
against the members of Karapatan, to guarantee in all circumstances their
physical and psychological integrity and to conduct a swift, thorough and
impartial investigation on the above-mentioned acts.
Background information:
Over
the past months, several human rights workers of the Southern Mindanao Regional
Chapter of Karapatan, as well as several peasant leaders and their families in Paquibato District, Davao City, and Bukidnon
Province, Mindanao, who had sought shelter in the Karapatan office, have
suffered surveillance, threats and harassment.
The
human rights defenders targeted include: Karapatan staff members Ms. Edessa Sandra Campos and Ms. Leonora
Ricafort; Ms. Ricafort’s son; peasant leaders,
Ms. Aida
Sanduman-Seisa, Secretary General of Paquibato District Peasants Alliance
(PADIPA), Mr. Eduardo Regidor,
acting Chairperson of PADIPA, and his three sons; and Mr. Primjun Oblianda-Cabatuan and Ms. Roselyn Tausa, both members of PADIPA.
On April 26, 2015, at 10 a.m., several men wearing light fatigue shirt
and shorts, and who appeared to be soldiers, showed up in the neighbourhood of
the Karapatan office in Davao City. The men walked back and forth on the road and stood in front of the
building trying to look through the gate at the people inside. One of them was heard relaying over the phone to an unknown interlocutor the
exact location of the NGO’s office and of the peasant leaders who had sought
refuge there.
Moreover, when Mr. Eduardo Regidor left the office with his three sons,
three men armed with 45 calibre pistols followed them. One of the men, the same
one that made the phone call, told him “Aha,
dito lang pala kayo nagtatago (So, you are hiding here)”. Alarmed by the
man’s statement, Mr. Eduardo and his sons quickly got into a taxi, and
instructed the driver to speed up. The three armed men then tailed the taxi on
their motorcycles, but eventually lost track of it.
On April 27, sometime after 7 p.m., Mr. Eduardo Regidor arrived at the
Karapatan office. A few minutes later, three men went to the office’s gate and
attempted to get inside. One of the men carried with him something wrapped with
a towel, possibly a gun. When asked, they refused to identify themselves. When
those inside the Karapatan office did not open the gate, one of the men pushed
the gate and the two other men attempted to climb the concrete wall to get
inside the compound. One of the men was the same person who had been conducting
surveillance outside the Karapatan office the day before.
The men’s attempts to barge into the Karapatan office stopped only when
a Karapatan staff member called the police for assistance and members of the
media. After interviews with both the media and the police, the police brought
the Karapatan staff members to the San Pedro Police Station to file a report of
the incident.
