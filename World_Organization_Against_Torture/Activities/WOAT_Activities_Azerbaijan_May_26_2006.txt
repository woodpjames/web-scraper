New InformationThe International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Human Rights Centre of Azerbaijan, a member of the OMCT network, that Mr. Eldar Salayev, 73 years old, professor and full member of the Academy of Science of Azerbaijan, has been authorised to travel abroad for medical treatment, despite he is still under investigation. According to the Prosecutor General, this authorisation was granted following appeals to the President.  However, according to information received, charges against Mr. Eldar Salayev are still pending. Brief Reminder of the SituationThe International Secretariat of OMCT was informed by the Human Rights Centre of Azerbaijan, a member of the OMCT network, of the release of Mr. Eldar Salayev, arrested on 27th October 2005 and accused of preparing the return of Mr. Rasul Quliyev to Azerbaijan. Mr. Salayev’s release followed a visit by the Ombudsman Mrs. Elmira Suleymanova, who asked the Prosecutor General to lift the arrest of Mr. Eldar Salayev. Furthermore, she visited Mr. Salayev and other detainees on November 12th  2005.  Mr. Rasul Quliyev, leader of the Democratic Party of Azerbaijan, has been accused of embezzlement, charges which seem to be politically motivated. Mr. Quliyev has been living in the United States for several years and declared that he would return to Azerbaijan to run in the presidential elections. The Prosecutor General had said that he would be immediately arrested and jailed if he returned to Azerbaijan (see related Case AZE 081105).  OMCT was gravely concerned by the fact that Mr. Salayev was being held in the prison of the Ministry of National Security which the United Nations Committee against Torture recommended be closed or transferred to the authority of the Ministry of Justice, in 2003. RemarksThe International Secretariat of OMCT wishes to thank the individuals and institutions who intervened on behalf of Mr. Salayev but urges you to continue to write to the authorities in Azerbaijan until all charges against Mr. Salayev are dropped. Action requested:Please write to the authorities in Azerbaijan urging them to: i.	take all necessary measures to guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Mr. Eldar Salayev; ii.	ensure that any remaining politically motivated charges against Mr. Eldar Salalyev are dropped without further delay; iii.	guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with international human rights standards.
