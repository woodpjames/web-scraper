from International Civil Society: International Community Must Ensure Rights
of Egyptians are Upheld1 February, 2011
We, civil society organizations from across the world, strongly
urge all governments, as well as regional and international organizations, to
clearly and unequivocally denounce the ongoing violent crackdown against the public
protests and demands for democratic reform and government accountability that have
been occurring across Egypt since the 25th of January. 
The Egyptian government has responded to protests with
excessive force. This has included wide-spread
use of beatings, arbitrary detentions and the use of rubber bullets and allegedly
live ammunition against unarmed civilians, resulting in over a hundred
deaths. Moreover, a state imposed
black-out on national cell phone services, the internet and independent media
channels was put in place on the 28th of January, making it very
difficult for Egyptians to report any abuses occurring.  On that same day the Egyptian government began
to deploy military forces in supplement of internal security forces.
With the strong risk that repression, violence and
instability in Egypt could escalate to unprecedented levels in the
coming days, it is critical that individual governments from all regions of the
world urgently exert strong and concerted pressure on the Egyptian government
to curb human rights abuses.
We call on the United Nations, its Member States and regional bodies to condemn the serious and
widespread human rights violations carried out by the Egyptian authorities against
civilians throughout the country. The
international community must remind the Egyptian government of its
international human rights obligations, urge it to fully respect the rights to
peaceful assembly, freedom of movement and freedom of expression,   and support the demands of the Egyptian people
for the holding of free and fair elections and the ending of the decades long State of Emergency law which has been used to enforce authoritarian rule.
