		The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint 
programme of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and the 
International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), requests your urgent 
intervention in the following situation in the Russian 
Federation.

		 

Description of the situation

		 

		The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the attack of 
the office of the Joint Mobile Group (JMG) in Grozny (Chechnya). The JMG is 
a renowned human rights organisation that has played a crucial role in 
revealing and documenting the continued violations of human rights committed 
in Chechnya.

		 

		According to the information received, on December 13 and 14, 2014, the 
office of the JMG in Grozny (Chechnya) was set ablaze. The workers were 
captured and searched by masked armed men.

		 

		The event on December14, was preceded by direct attacks against the Head 
of JMG and the Committee Against Torture, Mr. Igor Kalyapin 
. On December 10, 2014 the Head of the Chechen Republic, Mr. Ramzan Kadyrov 
accused Mr. Kalyapin on Instagram of supporting recent terrorist attacks in 
Chechnya. He notably suggested that Mr. Kalyapin received foreign funds from 
sources linked to Mr. Ahmad Umarov, the brother of the late Doku Umarov, the 
self-proclaimed Emir of the Caucasus Emirate and arch-rival of Mr. Kadyrov. 
Mr Kalyapin was subsequently attacked during his press conference in Moscow 
on December 11, 2014. On December 18, following statements of Mr. Ramzan 
Kadyrov, the Investigative Committee opened an investigation against Mr. 
Kalyapin.

		 

		The Observatory considers this new series of harassment as a clear act of 
reprisals for the recent activities carried out by Mr. Kalyapin, the JMG and 
the Committee Against Torture.

		 
	On December 5, 2014, in the aftermath of terrorist attacks in Grozny where 
26 people lost their lives, Mr. Kadyrov announced on his website and on 
social networks that the houses of all militants shall be burned, and their 
entire families expelled from Chechnya. In connection with these statements, 
on December 8, 2014, Mr. Kalyapin requested the Prosecutor General to start 
criminal proceedings against Mr. Kadyrov for violating the Criminal Code 
(“abuse of power”, Art. 286) and several articles of the 
Constitution (notably on the presumption of violence, freedom of movement, 
the right to private property and the right to housing).
	
		The Observatory calls on the authorities of the Chechen Republic and more 
generally of the the Russian Federation to guarantee the physical and 
psychological integrity of Mr. Igor Kalyapin, members of the JMG and members 
of the Committee Against Torture, and to put an end to any verbal and 
physical attacks and acts of harassment against human rights defenders in 
Chechnya.
