The Observatory for the
Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a partnership of the World Organisation
Against Torture (OMCT) and FIDH, requests your urgent
intervention in the following situation in Georgia.
 
Description of the situation:
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the assault
of three international election observers[1]
from a joint mission of the Norwegian Helsinki Committee (NHC), International
Partnership for Human Rights (IPHR) and the European Platform for Democratic
Elections (EPDE).
 
According to the information received, on October 8, 2016, just before
midnight, a group of unidentified men broke into the polling station 79 in the
Village of Jikhashkari, in Zugdidi district (West Georgia). They disrupted the
counting procedure, broke the ballot box, damaged election items and physically
attacked the observers. They took the phone of two of the observers, while the
third observer, a woman, was tripped and hit with an elbow. 
 
The police was present during the scene and did not intervene. The
observers subsequently filed a complaint at the Zugdidi Central Police Station
on the same evening. As of issuing that Urgent Appeal, two suspects had been
apprehended. 
 
The joint international election observation mission was established on
September 12, 2016, in Georgia, and on the day of the first round of the
parliamentary elections, 36 accredited observers were deployed in the country
to visit more than 200 polling stations.
 
The Observatory strongly condemns the assault against the
above-mentioned human rights defenders, and would like to remind Georgia's
obligation to protect international observers in all circumstances under both
the national Election Code and the OSCE Copenhagen Document. 
 
The Observatory nonetheless welcomes the investigation conducted by the
Georgian police and the inquiry opened by the General Inspectorate regarding
police’s behaviour, and hopes that the investigations will be carried out
impartially and transparently, in order to identify all those responsible,
bring them before an independent tribunal, and sanction them as provided by the
law. 
 
Action requested:
 
Please write
to the authorities in Georgia urging them to:
 
i. Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological
integrity of the above-mentioned international election observers;
 
ii. Ensure that they are not subject to any acts of harassment, so that
they are able to carry out their work without hindrances in Georgia;
 
iii. Undertake a thorough, impartial and transparent criminal
investigation into the assault perpetrated against them, in order to identify
all those responsible, bring them before a competent and impartial tribunal and
apply to them the sanctions provided by the law;
 
iv. Comply with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights
Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly on December 9, 1998, in particular:
 
- Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and
in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and
realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and
international levels” 
- Article 5 and 6 (c), which stipulate that “for the purpose of
promoting and protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms, everyone has
the right, individually or in association with others, [...] to meet or
assemble peacefully” and “to study, discuss, form and hold opinions on the
observance, both in law and in practice, of all human rights and fundamental
freedoms and, through these matters and other appropriate means, to draw public
attention to those matters”;
- Article 12.1, which provides that “the State shall take all necessary
measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone,
individually or in association with others, against any violence, threats,
retaliation, de facto or
de jure adverse
discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or
her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the [...] Declaration”;
 
v. More generally, ensure in all circumstances the respect for human
rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international and regional
human rights standards and human rights instruments ratified by Georgia.
