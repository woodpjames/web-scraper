New information: The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the sentencing of Mr. Yasser Goli, a Kurdish rights activist and Secretary General of the Kurdish Students’ Union of Iranian Universities, detained since October 9, 2007[1], to 15 years in prison According to the information received, on November 6, 2008, Mr. Yasser Goli was sentenced by the second branch of the Revolutionary Court of Sanandaj, Iranian Kurdistan, to 15 years in prison and to his banishment to Kerman, in the east of the country, for having contacts with “illegal Kurdish organisations” (Article 168 of the Islamic Penal Code). His lawyer will appeal this sentence. As of issuing this urgent appeal, he remains detained in a prison in Kurdistan. No further information could be obtained as to his exact place of detention. The Observatory expresses its deep concern about Mr. Goli’s severe sentencing, which is once again evidence of the ongoing harsh repression of the Iranian authorities against human rights defenders. Furthermore, the Observatory wishes to insist on the fact that Iran had committed to “uphold the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights”[2] by presenting its candidacy to the Human Rights Council 2006 election and had insisted in this regard on the fact that the country had “continuously put great efforts into safeguarding the status and inherent dignity of the human person as well as the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms”[3]. In order to ensure the continuation of these efforts, the Observatory urges the Islamic Republic of Iran to conform with international human rights standards. Background information: After being in prison for three months, Mr. Goli was transferred to the Central Prison of Sanandaj on January 16, 2008. Until then, he was not allowed to meet with his family. Mr. Goli suffers from a heart ailment and has been admitted to the hospital numerous times for treatment. Hi whole family has fought on his behalf to shed light on his condition and plight. His father, Mr. Saleh Goli, was arrested on October 31, 2007 in connection with his son’s case. His bail was set at 10 million tomans but he was subsequently released.  Actions requested: Please write to the authorities in Iran urging them to:   Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Yasser Goli;  Release Mr. Yasser Goli immediately and unconditionally since his detention is arbitrary as it merely aims at sanctioning his activities in favour of human rights;  Put an end to all acts of harassment, including at the judicial level, against Mr. Yasser Goli as well as against all Iranian human rights defenders;  Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, Article 6.b, which provides that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others [...] freely to publish, impart or disseminate to others views, information and knowledge on all human rights and fundamental freedoms”, and Article 12.2, which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”;  More generally, ensure in all circumstances the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with international and regional human rights instruments ratified by Iran.
