URGENT APPEAL -
THE OBSERVATORY

 
BLR 003 / 1012 / OBS 093
Arbitrary closure
Belarus
October 12, 2012
 
The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of
the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation
Against Torture (OMCT), has received new information and requests your urgent
intervention in the following situation in Belarus.
 
Description of the situation:
 
The
Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the liquidation and
closure of Platforma, a human rights organisation specialised in the protection
of prisoners’ rights.
 
According to the information received, on October 9,
2012, the Minsk economic court decided to close down Platforma. The decision
follows a claim of the Tax Office of Minsk's Savestki district that the
organisation had allegedly failed to lodge the tax return on time, and to
inform it about a change of address. However, it appears that those claims are
groundless, as Platforma did indeed lodge the tax return on time, but the Tax
Office of Minsk reportedly lost the document. Representatives of the
organisation announced that they would appeal against the court decision.
 
It is to be noted that Platforma has been repeatedly
harassed by the authorities over the past months. For instance, on June 26,
2012, the Minsk Prosecutor's Office warned Mr. Andrei Bandarenka, Head
of Platforma, that he was “discrediting the Republic of Belarus and its
governmental bodies”. These warnings took place after Platforma urged the international
Ice Hockey Federation not to hold the 2014 World Championship in Minsk as long
as the country held political prisoners and used repression against human
rights defenders, journalists and civil society activists.  A few days earlier, on June 18, 2012,
Platforma had published a report on human rights abuses in detention centres
and correctional institutions in Belarus.
 
In addition, on July 19, 2012, the KGB informed Mr.
Bandarenka that it had registered his name for alleged draft evasion and that
he might face foreign travel restrictions under President Lukashenko's recent
Decree No. 295. The Minsk Tsentralny District Court eventually dismissed the
case on July 20, after Mr. Bandarenka lodged a complaint against the travel
ban. The Interior Ministry's Immigration and Citizenship Department
acknowledged that there had been a mistake and removed him from the travel ban
list.
 
On July 26, 2012, the authorities finally warned
Platforma that the organisation would be closed down for alleged failure to comply
with tax requirements. The Tax Office of Minsk Savestki district filed a claim
but the hearing, initially scheduled on September 6, 2012, was finally
postponed to October 9, 2012.
 
The Observatory notes that, like the vast majority of
NGOs in Belarus, Platforma has never been able to obtain official registration
in order to operate legally. This situation raises fears that, if it continues
to carry out its human rights activities, its members might face conviction
under Article 193.1 of the Criminal Code (criminal responsibility for
participation in the activities of an unregistered association), which
specifically aims at hindering civil society activities.
 
 
 
The
Observatory strongly condemns the court decision to close down Platforma, as it
is arbitrary and seems to merely aim at sanctioning its legitimate human rights
activities. It is all the more concerned as human rights defenders and
organisations have been subjected to increasing pressure over the past months,
in the electoral context.
 
Actions requested :
 
Please
write to the Belarusian authorities, urging them to :
 
i. Put an end to any kind
of harassment - including at the administrative and judicial levels - against
Mr. Andrei Bandarenka, Platforma itself and all its members, as well as against
all other human rights defenders in Belarus;
 
ii. Conform with the
provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the
General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially:
- its Article 1, which states that “everyone has
the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to
strive for the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental
freedoms at the national and international levels”,
- its Article 6 (b) and (c), which states that
“Everyone has the right, individually and in association with others […] as
provided for in human rights and other applicable international instruments,
freely to publish, impart or disseminate to others views, information and
knowledge on all human rights and fundamental freedoms and [...] to study,
discuss, form and hold opinions on the observance, both in law and in practice,
of all human rights and fundamental freedoms and, through these and other
appropriate means, to draw public attention to those matters”.
- and its Article 12.2, which provides that “the
State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the
competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others,
against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse
discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his
or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present
Declaration” ;
 
iii. Ensure in all
circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance
with international human rights standards and international instruments
