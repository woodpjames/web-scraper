Re: Request to implement Decision A/HRC/WGAD/2012/39 of the United
Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention on the case of human rights
defender Ales Bialiatski
 
Dear Minister, 
 
At its 64th session, the United Nations (UN) Working Group on Arbitrary
Detention (WGAD) adopted Decision A/HRC/WGAD/2012/39, published on November 23,
2012, in which it found in particular that the detention of Mr. Ales
Bialiatski, President of the Human Rights Centre (HRC) “Viasna” and FIDH
Vice-President, was arbitrary, “being in contravention of Article 20, paragraph
1, of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights (UDHR) and Article 22 of the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights” (ICCPR). The WGAD
emphasised that “the adequate remedy is to release Mr. Bialiatski and accord
him an enforceable right to compensation pursuant to Article 9, paragraph 5, of
the [ICCPR]”. 
 
On March 5, 2013, during the 22nd session of the UN Human Rights Council
(HRC) held in Geneva, the Delegation of the Republic of Belarus challenged the
authority of the WGAD to investigate and adopt an opinion on the detention of
Mr. Ales Bialiatski and described the investigation and opinion as an
interference into the internal affairs of Belarus. 
 
The Observatory recalls that UN Special Procedures (including the WGAD)
are subsidiary bodies of the UN. They were set up by and report back to the UN
HRC. The members of the WGAD are selected by a Consultative Group appointed by
the UN HRC, on the basis of their “expertise and experience in the area of the
mandate, integrity, independence and impartiality”[1].
Their “legal opinions”, such as the above-mentioned decision on Mr. Ales
Bialiatski, are UN decisions. The Republic of Belarus as a UN Member State has
an obligation to cooperate with all UN bodies and mechanisms (as provided for
in Article 56 of the UN Charter), and it is also bound by treaties, in
particular the ICCPR, which Belarus ratified in 1973.
 
WGAD is entrusted by the Human Rights Council with the mandate to
investigate “alleged cases of detention imposed arbitrarily or otherwise
inconsistently with the relevant international standards set forth in the
Universal Declaration or in relevant international legal instruments accepted
by the States concerned”[2]. 
 
The WGAD assesses information collected under an adversary procedure in
a transparent manner and uses a standard of “convincing evidence” to determine
whether a detention is arbitrary or inconsistent with the applicable
international standards or whether the information available is not sufficient
to make such determination. The working practices of the WGAD were approved by
the UN Commission on Human Rights on April 15, 1997[3].
 
Being an independent mechanism[4],
it has the discretion to act on any information or individual case it deems
appropriate. The Observatory emphasises that the WGAD has acted in full
compliance with its prerogatives. In that respect, we recall that the WGAD
“evaluate[s] all information in the light of internationally recognized human
rights standards relevant to their mandate, and of international conventions to
which the State concerned is a party[5]”.
 
In that case, the WGAD held that laws in forced applied to prosecute and
detain Mr. Bialiatski contradicted international human rights standards binding
the Republic of Belarus.
 
In light of all these elements, the Observatory respectfully urges you
to comply with the aforementioned international obligations and, more
particularly, to implement Decision A/HRC/WGAD/2012/39 of the UN WGAD on the
case of Mr. Ales Bialiatski, in particular by:
 
-     
releasing him
immediately and unconditionally, and accord him an enforceable right to
compensation (paragraph 53 of the Decision) ;
 
-     
conforming with the
“negative obligation “of Belarus “not to interfere with the founding of
associations or their activities”, but also with the “positive obligation” of
the State “to ensure and provide […] measures such as facilitating
associations' tasks by public funding or allowing tax exemptions for funding
received from outside the country” (paragraph 48 of the decision).
 
Finally, the Observatory takes note with appreciation of the Republic of
Belarus' commitment to cooperate in a constructive manner with the Human Rights
Council and its thematic special procedures and urges it to extend a standing
invitation to all UN Special Procedures and invite the UN Special Rapporteur on
the situation of human rights defenders as manifestations of this significant
commitment. 
 
We hope that you will take all these elements into account and remain at
your disposal for further discussions,
 
Yours sincerely,
