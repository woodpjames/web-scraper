Release on bail / Judicial harassment
Sudan
May 18, 2015
The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint
programme of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World
Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), has received new information and requests
your urgent intervention in the following situation in Sudan.
New information:
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the release
on bail of Mr. Adil Bakheit, member of the Board of Trustees of the
Sudan Human Rights Monitor (SHRM) and human rights trainer who played an
important monitoring role during the 2010 elections and 2011 referendum in
Sudan.
According to the information received, on May 3, 2015, Mr. Bakheit was
released from police custody, where he was detained since April 16 (see
background information), after providing a personal guarantor who would
pay a fine should Mr. Bakheit fail to respond to future summonses.
However, Mr. Bakheit faces the possibility of a re-arrest at any time as
charges against him still stand. In particular, two of the charges held against
him, namely the ones under Article 50 (“undermining the constitutional system”)
and Article 51 (“waging war against the State”) are classified as crimes
against the State and punished with the death penalty. 
It was further reported that on May 10, 2015 Mr. Bakheit's lawyer filed
an appeal to the Minister of Justice calling for either a prompt trial or for the
charges to be dropped.
The
Observatory is extremely concerned about the judicial
harassment of Mr. Adil Bakheit, as it seems only to aim at sanctioning his
human rights activities and calls upon authorities in Sudan to immediately and
unconditionally drop all charges against him.
Background information:
On April 16, 2015, at approximately 11 a.m. Mr.
Bakheit responded to a summons by the National Intelligence and Security
Services (NISS) in Khartoum. Later that day, the State security prosecution office
charged Mr. Bakheit with seven criminal offences under the 1991 Criminal Act, including charges of “criminal joint acts in execution
of criminal conspiracy” (Article 21), “criminal conspiracy” (Article 24),
“calling for opposition to public authority by use of violence or criminal
force” (Article 63), “publication of false news” (Article 66) and
“impersonating a public servant” (Article 93). Two additional charges brought
up against Mr. Bakheit - “offences against the State undermining the
constitutional system” (Article 50), “waging war against the State” (Article
51) - are classified as crimes against the State and carry the death penalty.
He was detained at the Al Awasat police station
in Khartoum from April 16, until his release on bail on May 3, 2015. 
Moreover, three weeks prior to his arrest, on
March 26, the laptop of Mr. Bakheit, which contains information about his human
rights work, was confiscated when the NISS raided a workshop organised by the
Khartoum-based TRACKS for Training and Human Development, whilst it was hosting
a training session on social responsibility.
Actions requested:
The Observatory urges the authorities of Sudan to: 
i. Drop all charges against Mr. Adil Bakheit, as they only aim at sanctioning
his human rights activities;
ii.Put
an end to any kind of harassment, including at the judicial level, against Mr. Adil Bakheit, as well as against
all human rights defenders in Sudan, and ensure in all circumstances that he is
able to carry out his activities without hindrances;
iii. Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and
psychological integrity of Mr. Adil Bakheit, as well as of all human rights
defenders in Sudan;
iv. Conform in any circumstances with the provisions
of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, in particular 
its Article 1, which states that “everyone has
the right, individually or in association with others, to promote the
protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the
national and international levels”, 
and its article 12.2 which provides that “the
State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the
competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others,
against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse
discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his
or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present
Declaration”; 
v. Ensure in all circumstances respect for human
rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights
standards and international instruments ratified by Sudan.
