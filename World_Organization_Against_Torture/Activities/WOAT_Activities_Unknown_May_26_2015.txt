pleasure to issue its E-Bulletin on the 54th session of the Committee
against Torture which took place from 20 April to 15 May 2015.

In 2014, the OMCT
launched an initiative to mobilize and coordinate activities of civil society
organisations in relation to the Convention against Torture and its Committee.
We facilitate civil society engagement, such as by building coalitions, sharing
information, ensuring timely and effective report submissions, advising on
advocacy opportunities, and supporting direct access to the Committee against
Torture. Find out more on our website.
During its 54th
session, the Committee against Torture considered the State reports submitted
by Colombia, Congo, Luxembourg, New
Zealand, Romania, Serbia, Spain, and
the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. In accordance with Article 19 of
the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment
or Punishment, the Committee examined the progress made by the respective State
parties in giving effect to the Convention and identified problematic areas
where compliance must be improved.
