New information  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Sudan Organisation Against Torture (SOAT), a member of the OMCT network, of the continuing wave of arbitrary arrests and detentions in Darfour, Sudan.  According to the information received, during July and August 2002, 66 people from the Four tribe have been arrested in Zalingei, Tour, Nartati and Golou in Jebel Mara province. The 66 people have not been formally charged, but are suspected by the Government of working to form an opposition group, calling themselves the “Darfour Liberation Front”. The arrested men were initially detained in various detention centres in Darfour, but 42 of them have now been moved to Nyala prison. A list of their names can be found below.  According to the report, 11 of the men who were transferred to Nyala prison were seriously ill including Nasia Al din Ahmed Tambour and Ahmed Ibrahim Azrag, who were arrested while they were lying in hospital beds. 51-year old teacher Mr. Nasia Al din Ahmed Tambour only has one kidney and was taken from his hospital bed on July 15th 2002, to Zalingei detention centre, before being transferred to Nyala prison on August 16th 2002. 79-year old merchant Mr. Ahmed Abrahim Azrag was reportedly taken from his hospital bed on July 15th 2002 to Zalingei, where he was deprived of medical attention. The whereabouts of Mr. Azrag remain unknown. 33-year old advocate Mr. Abdel Wahid Mohamed Ahmed Nour is reportedly not receiving adequate health care in Nyala prison - he only has one lung and suffers from diabetes.  According to the information received, the detainees in question were tortured after their arrests. Moreover, the detainees are being held in conditions that constitute ill-treatment. The food provided consists of a badly cooked Sorghum porridge, which is given once or twice a day. Furthermore, the detainees are held in small, overcrowded cells, which are full of mosquitoes and lack adequate ventilation. The detainees cannot go to the toilet when they need to, but only when the prison guards feel its necessary, as a result of which the conditions in the cells are becoming a health hazard.   The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned for the physical and psychological integrity of the afore-mentioned detainees, in particular Mr. Nasia Al din Ahmed Tambour, Mr. Abdel Wahid Mohamed Ahmed and Mr. Ahmed Abrahim Azrag, given their reported ill-health More generally, OMCT is concerned by the reported worsening human rights situation in Darfour, which includes mass arrests, harsh detention conditions and the continuing persecution of the people from the African tribes native to the region.  Brief reminder of the situation  Human rights violations have been on the rise due to tribal conflicts that have been provoked by the drought, forcing the tribes to fight over the little viable land that remains. The whole of Dafour is reportedly affected and almost 1 million people risk starvation. So far 56 Four villages in the region have been depopulated following attacks by militia from Arab tribes. Although the authorities are aware of the situation, they are not taking any action into the events, leaving the perpetrators to enjoy impunity and reinforcing claims that the Government of Sudan is in fact training and supporting militia from the Arab tribes.  The following detainees, that were the subject of the previous urgent appeal concerning this case, were arbitrarily arrested on July 11th 2002 - no new information has been provided as to their situation:   Abdel Moula Aam Abdel Moula  (farmer); Gialani Omer (driver); Mohamed Ahmed Abdel Moula (teacher); Amir Bahr elDin (farmer); Abdo Harran (farmer); Abbo Hassan (Shartai – tribal leader); Abdel Karim Mohamed Abkr (Ommda); Abdalla Muhagir  (Sheikh – tribal leader).  The following names were arrested on July 15th, 2002- no new information has been provided as to their situation:  Ali Shogar (health worker in Nartiti); Mohamed Ismael (pharmacist at Zalingei hospital); Adam Ahmed (transport commission agent).
