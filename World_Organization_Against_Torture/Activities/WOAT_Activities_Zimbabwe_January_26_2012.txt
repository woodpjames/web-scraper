The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint 
programme of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World 
Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), has received new information and requests 
your urgent intervention in the following situation in the following situation 
in Zimbabwe.
 
New information:
 
The Observatory has been informed by the Zimbabwe Human Rights 
Association (ZimRights) about the acquittal of Mr. Joel Hita, ZimRights Regional Chairperson in Masvingo, and ZimRights, represented by Ms. Pelagia Razemba Semakweli, Acting National Chairperson.
 
According to the information received, on January 23, 2012, 
Magistrate Mwanyisa (Masvingo jurisdiction) acquitted Mr. Joel Hita and Ms. 
Pelagia Razemba Semakweli of charges of “holding a public meeting without 
notifying the authorities” under the Public Order and Security Act (POSA) after 
they organised a photo exhibition entitled “Reflections” in Masvingo in 2010, 
which showcased pictures on political violence during the pre-electoral context 
in 2008 (See background information). This acquittal followed an application for 
exception to the charges, filed on the same date by defence lawyer Blessing 
Nyamaropa, member of Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights (ZLHR), based on the 
repeal of said offence in 2007. The application was conceded by the Public 
Prosecutor.
 
The Observatory welcomes the acquittal of ZimRights and Mr. Hita, and thanks all the persons, institutions and 
organisations who intervened in their favour. However, the Observatory remains concerned by the 
recurrent use of judicial harassment against human rights defenders in 
Zimbabwe, which merely aims at sanctioning their human rights 
activities, and calls 
upon the Zimbabwean authorities to put an immediate end to this 
practice. 
 
Background information:
 
On March 17 and 19, 2010, the police interrogated Mr. Okay Machisa, ZimRights Executive Director, and Ms. Olivia Gumbo, ZimRights National Programme Manager, about the objective and intents of a 
photo exhibition entitled “Reflections”, scheduled to open in Harare on March 
24, 2010 as part of a programme to incite reflections on the 2008 political 
violence. Previously, ZimRights had sent a notification letter of the exhibition to the police and 
secured an authorisation from the Harare High Court.
 
On March 23, 2010, Mr. Okay Machisa was arrested by a group of 20 
officers of the Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP), who also removed, without any 
warrant, 65 pictures showing the use of violence to disperse demonstrations. Mr. 
Machisa was brought to the Harare central police station, until his release a 
few hours later following the intervention of the ZLHR. The officer commanding 
Harare central district informed him that he had “not approved” the exhibition 
and gave Mr. Machisa seven days to provide “letters of consent from individuals 
and organisations” appearing in the photographs. He threatened to launch 
unspecified criminal charges against Mr. Machisa if he failed to provide those 
documents. On March 24, 2010, the police returned the photos to ZimRights following an order of the High Court issued on the same day. 

 
On April 26, 2010, a group of police officers arrested Mr. Joel Hita, 
Ms. Olivia Gumbo, Ms. Cynthia Manjoro and Ms. Lio Chamahwinya, members of ZimRights, while they were preparing the launch of the same photo exhibition 
in Masvingo. Once more, the police confiscated all the pictures and took the 
defenders to the Masvingo police station. Everyone was released a few hours 
later, except Mr. Hita who was released on April 27, 2010. On April 28, he 
appeared before the Masvingo Magistrate Court on the charge of “holding a public 
meeting without notifying the authorities”, although the exhibition launch was a 
private function. On August 5, 2010, the Attorney General’s office also decided 
to prosecute ZimRights itself as an organisation for the same charges within the same 
criminal case[1].
