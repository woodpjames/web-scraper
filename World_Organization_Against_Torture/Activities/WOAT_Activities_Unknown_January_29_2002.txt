Brief description of the situation:  The Observatory has been informed by the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights in Serbia that acts of harassment and threats against the organization have escalated in recent weeks into deliberate obstruction and intimidation by both private and government affiliated groups.  According to the information received, on January 23, 2002, Ms. Sonja Biserko, Chairperson of the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights, addressed a letter to the Serbian Ministry of the Interior, Mr. Dusan Mihajlovic, to inform that the Serbian Helsinki Committee as an organization, as well as its members, and especially Ms. Biserko herself, are confronted with constant telephone threats and public hate speeches by politicians of the ruling Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS) coalition.  According to Ms. Biserko, such hate speeches are supported by private media as well as the official governmental newspaper, Borba.   Additionally, in the last weeks, burglary attempts were made at the central office of the Helsinki Committee, as well as at the apartment of Mr. Slavija Stanojlovic, Deputy Chair of the Committee.  The Helsinki Committee for Human Rights in Serbia and the International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights (IHF) are convinced that these recent incidents are not random occurrences, but appear to be part of a larger intimidation campaign.    Action requested  Please write to the authorities the Serbian authorities and to the authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, urging them to:  i.	put an end to any kind of harassment against Ms. Biserko and all members of the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights in Serbia and ensure that they be allowed to carry out their work without obstacles; ii.	abide by the provisions of the Declaration on the Protection of Human Rights Defenders adopted on the 9th of December 1998, by the U.N.
