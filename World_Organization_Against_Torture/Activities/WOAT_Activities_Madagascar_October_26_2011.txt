On the
occasion of the review of the initial report of 
Madagascar by the Committee against Torture during its 47th session (31
October - 25 November 2011), the World Organisation against Torture (OMCT), its
member organisation the Action des chrétiens pour l'abolition de la torture de
Madagascar (ACAT Madagascar) and the Fédération internationale de l’ACAT
(FIACAT) have submitted to the Committee against Torture information and
recommendations in relation to the implementation by the State Party of the
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
Punishment. 
This
information was notably collected during a preparatory mission to Antananarivo
from 4 to 8 July 2011 organised by OMCT and FIACAT in collaboration with ACAT
Madagascar. The delegation met officials of the High Transitional Authority,
representatives of diplomatic missions and national and international
non-governmental organisations. The mission delegates were also able to visit
the Antanimora central prison in Antananarivo and the Tsiafahy high-security
prison.
The CAT public session
on Madagascar will be webcasted by OMCT.
