Description of the situation: The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the arbitrary detention of Ms. Oyazimkhon Khidirova, member of the Djizak branch of the Uzbekistan International Society for Human Rights, one the few NGOs registered with the Ministry of Justice. Ms. Khidirova is an active defender of the rights of farmers and she has been denouncing corruption at the local level. According to the information received, in the morning of July 28, 2009, agents of the ROVD (local delegation of the Ministry of Internal Affairs) in Dustlik arrested Ms. Oyazimkhon Khidirova. The latter was then placed in detention and charged under Articles 277-3-g (hooliganism), 184 (tax evasion or other payments), 205 (abuse of power or office) and 168 (fraud) of the Criminal Code, reportedly on the basis of criminal proceedings that were initiated against her on July 16, 2009. On August 3, 2009, the Arnaysaysky District Criminal Court confirmed Ms. Oyazimkhon Khidirova’s detention throughout the stage of the investigation. The latter immediately lodged an appeal. On August 5, 2009, the Djizak Court of Appeal was to issue a decision regarding this appeal, but no information could be obtained on that question as of issuing this urgent appeal. Ms. Oyazimkhon Khidirova would remain held at the medical division of the Dustlik detention centre, since her health status would have deteriorated while in detention. Further, her house would have been searched on July 29, 2009 by representatives of the police forces, reportedly with the aim of discovering weapons, drugs and religious literature, but nothing of this kind was found. The Observatory expresses its deep concern at Ms. Oyazimkhon Khidirova’s arbitrary detention, which seems to merely aim at sanctioning her human rights activities, in particular the disclosure of information concerning the situation of farmers in the Dustlik district implicating local public officials. More recently, she directly targeted the District Prosecutor and Vice-Governor of the district (vice-hakim) for acts of corruption in an open letter addressed to President Karimov. The Observatory expresses its deepest concern with these blatantly abusive proceedings and arbitrary detention, which are further evidence that the Uzbek authorities are determined to silence any form of dissent in the region and in the country. The Observatory recalls that as a participating State of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), Uzbekistan recognises “the need for particular attention, support and protection for human rights defenders by the OSCE, its Institutions and field operations, as well as by participating States” . The Observatory further urges the European Commission Delegation as well as European Union (EU) Member-States embassies in the Uzbekistan to call upon the Uzbek authorities to comply with the relevant international norms and standards, in particular the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, and take action regarding the above-mentioned elements, in line with the EU Guidelines on Human Rights Defenders. Actions required: Please write to the Uzbek authorities urging them to:   Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Ms. Oyazimkhon Khidirova;  Release Ms. Oyazimkhon Khidirova immediately and unconditionally since her detention is arbitrary as it only aims at sanctioning her human rights activities;  Put an end to all acts of harassment - including at the judicial level - against Ms. Oyazimkhon Khidirova as well as all other human rights defenders in Uzbekistan and ensure in all circumstances that they are able to carry out their human rights activities without any hindrance;  Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels” and article 12.2, which states that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”;  Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by Uzbekistan.
