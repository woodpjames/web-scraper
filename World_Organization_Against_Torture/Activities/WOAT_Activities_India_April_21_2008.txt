Brief description of the situation: The Observatory has been informed by People’s Watch about the arbitrary arrest of participants to “The Long March for Justice for Special Task Force (STF) Victims”, which was organised in the framework of the Campaign for Relief and Rehabilitation of Victims of the STF violence (torture, cruel and inhumane treatment, degrading punishment, disappearances, extra judicial killings, custodial rapes, arbitrary detention and so on) in the States of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu[1]. According to the information received, on April 20, 2008, the Long March for Justice for STF Victims started at Sathyamangalam in Erode District, Tamil Nadu, although it was denied police permission. First, a public meeting was held at the New Bus Stand in Sathyamangalam at 9.30. a.m. Then, a crowd of 500 persons, among whom leaders of political parties, STF victims and members of the Campaign for the Relief and Rehabilitation of STF Victims from Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, began their long march. At the outskirts of Sathyamangalam, police officers stopped the marchers and prevented them from going further. Four hundreds of the marchers, including Messrs. Henri Tiphagne, Executive Director of People’s Watch, Mahaboob Batcha, Managing Trustee of the Society for Community Organisation Trust (SOCO Trust), and V.P. Gunasekaran, District Secretary of the Communist Party of India, were arrested and brought under police custody at the Ramasamy Goundar Maryammal Wedding Hall in Sathyamangalam. On the evening of April 20, 2008, at 5.45 p.m., the police released the mass protesters. Immediately after being released, the demonstrators moved to Anthiyur to participate in a public meeting, which had an audience of over 1,000 people. The Joint Committee[2] then decided to continue the Long March for Justice for STF Victims. On the next day, media reported that a clarification had been given by the Government of Tamil Nadu regarding the issue, saying that compensation had already been given to the victims and the Government of Tamil Nadu has done its duty. In the early morning of April 21, 2008, the local police informed the organisers of the March that they had been given instructions to arrest them if they started the March. At 9.30 a.m., the protestors were stopped by the police who announced that they were going to arrest them. When asked for the grounds of arrest, the policemen floundered for some time and later came up with a document that was vague and went on to arrest 115 marchers, including 38 women and one child. The arrestees have been lodged in Soudeeswari Amman Wedding Hall in Anthiyur. The Observatory expresses its deepest concern about these acts of harassment against peaceful demonstrators seeking justice for victims of the STF violence, and calls upon the Indian authorities to release all persons who were arrested and to authorise the continuation of the March. The Observatory also recalls that India was elected as a member of the Human Rights Council in 2007 for three years, and has committed, in this regard, to “uphold the highest standards of promotion and protection of human rights”[3]. Action requested: Please write to the Indian authorities and ask them to:   Take all necessary measures to guarantee, in all circumstances, the physical and psychological integrity of all persons arrested ;  Release all persons arrested immediately and unconditionally, as their detention is arbitrary since it only aims at sanctioning their human rights activities;  Put an end to any act of harassment against all human rights defenders in India;  Comply with the provisions of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 9, 1998, in particular Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually or collectively, to promote the protection and fulfilment of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, as well as Article 12.2, which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually or in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”;  Guarantee the respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and other international human rights instruments ratified by India.
