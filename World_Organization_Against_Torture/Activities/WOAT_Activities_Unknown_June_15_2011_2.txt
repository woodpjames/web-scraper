Save as PDF Print versionStatements / 2011 / JuneEuropean Parliament, Brussels 15th of June: Public Hearing on the occasion of The International Day in Support of Victims of Torture with the participation of the OMCTCombating terrorism risks undermining
universal ban on torture
Very disturbing practices used in countering terrorism
have become a source of undermining fully established human rights norms, such
as the universal ban of torture and other ill-treatments - this was one of the
conclusions of the public hearing of  the Subcommittee on Human Rights
today, 15 June, held to mark the upcoming International Day against Torture
on  26th June.
"More than 20 years after the entry
into force of the Convention against Torture, an increasing number of
governments are allowing the practice of torture to spread, and public opinion
appears to be tolerant of the practice", recalled  Heidi Hautala
(Greens/EFA, FI), chairperson of the Subcommittee on Human Rights at the
opening of the hearing.
Speaking about the main challenges to the absolute
prohibition of torture and other inhumane treatments in the context of
counter-terrorism, particularly with reference to Pakistan, Ms Hina Jilani,
human rights lawyer and a founding member of the Human Rights Commission in
Pakistan, underlined the increased potential of the use of torture by states in
combating terrorism, mentioning that the main reason for this is the lack of
accountability of national authorities dealing with counter-terrorism
activities.
      Reception by the OMCT Europe, during the public hearing of June 15, 2011, to mark the International Day in Support of Victims of Torture in the presence of Hina Jilani, the Human Rights Commission Pakistan - Heidi Hautala, member of European Parliament (Greens, Finland) - Eric Sottas, OMCT Secretary General and Gerald Staberock, Deputy Secretary General, OMCT.No scrutiny of intelligence services

Another alarming trend in her opinion is the military
response to terrorism - incommunicado detention, forced disappearances -
practices potentially allowing torture and which cannot be detected. This
militarisation and the expanded role of intelligence services in countering
terrorism have lead to "parallel systems of justice, with very limited
judicial and civil scrutiny", said Ms Jilani.
Moreover, according to Ms Jilani, in most countries
"there is no legal basis for the transfer of power to interrogate and
detain to secret services" which in the end are unaccountable bodies
enjoying immunity. She added that intelligence is incrementally encroaching in
the domain of law enforcement. 
On the questions raised be MEPs Richard Richard Howitt
(S&D, GB) and Barbara Lochbihler (Greens/ EFA, DE) on the need to have
clear guidelines to deal with secret services, Mr Eric Sottas, Secretary
General, World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) replied: "We need to
establish clear standards, since there is an obligation of security services
when they have a feeling that information originates from sources where torture
is a common practice."
Crucial role of prosecution and conviction of
terrorist suspects
"Counter-terrorism actions are certainly not
conclusive unless they take the directions of proper prosecution of terrorist
suspects. Ms Jilani underlined that conviction and prosecution are crucial due
to the following reasons:
·        
justifying the full engagement of
government in countering terrorism
·        
helping raise public awareness and
combating propaganda according to which these suspects are supposedly victims
of injustice 
·        
transparency - people forget the
committed crimes and associate terrorist activities with some kind of
ideology, thus becoming very difficult to find public support for counter
terrorism measures. This perpetuates power and influence of groups interested
in promoting terrorism activities in order to promote a particular agenda.

Future funding of trauma therapy centres in Europe
MEP Lochbihler expressed her concerns regarding the
future of the Centers for torture victims post-2013 when funding from the
European Instruments for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR) will expire since
these centres function within the EU and the EIDHR has an external dimension.
The EEAS representative informed about a 1 million Euros pilot project which
has been launched to ensure the sustainable financing of these rehabilitation
centres. 
Psychological terror in Communist Europe
MEPs Vytautas Landsbergis (EPP, LT) and Lazslo Tokes
(EPP, RO) recalled the systematic use of psychological torture in the countries
of the Communist bloc, a cruel technique, very difficult to prove but with
long-lasting consequences on the victims.
Lotte Leicht from Human Rights Watch recalled that
there 118 court verdicts of the European Court for Human Rights dealing with
torture, impunity, forced disappearances in Russia, which have to be
implemented and called on the MEPs to put pressure by raising this cases high
on the political agenda with Russia.
