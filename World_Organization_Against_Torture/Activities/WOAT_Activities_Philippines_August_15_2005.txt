New InformationThe International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Task Force Detainees of the Philippines (TFDP), a member of the OMCT network, that the complaint lodged by the survivors of an attack by the 25th Infantry Battalion against members of this Battalion for murder and frustrated murder was resolved by the Prosecutor on 21 May, 2005 and found probable cause. But instead of filing the case in court, the records from this complaint were transferred to the Office of the Ombudsman for the Military for Mindanao on 15 June 2005 for comment and/or approval.  Brief reminder of the situationOn 8 February 2005, members of 25th Infantry Battalion of the Philippine Army killed three civilians, Mr. Francisco Bulane (32), Mr. Padilla Bulane (29) and Mr. Prumencio Bulane (28), and wounded four others, Mr. Rogelio Bulane (42), Mr. Ricky Bulane (16), and Mr. Richard Bulane (31), members of the indigenous group B’laans, in Mindanao, Philippines.  According to the information received by TFDP, at about 6.30 in the morning, in sitio Latil, Barangay Colonsabak, Matan-ao, Davao del Sur, Island of Mindanao, members of the 25th Infantry Battalion of the Philippine Army based in Sta. Cruz, Davao Del Sur, opened fire on Mr. Rogelio Bulane and his son Ricky who had gone to the river about 3km from their home to catch food.  According to Mr. Bulane, the soldiers fired at them from a distance without provocation. The first gun burst accordingly hit the back portion of his head but did not penetrate. Mr. Rogelio Bulane said he was thrown about 4m away when he was hit with an M-79 in the back portion of his body.    His son Ricky was also hit with bullets. After several minutes the gun burst stopped and Mr. Bulane pretended that he was already dead. The military officers came closer to him, but he did not move and the soldiers thought that he was already dead. He then reportedly overheard soldiers saying, “we will charge this person as member of New People’s Army (NPA)”.  When Mr. Rogelio Bulane sensed that the soldiers were busy eating, he slowly crawled to the riverbank where he covered himself with grass. After several minutes, the military noticed that he had disappeared and searched the area without success. The soldiers left the area after several minutes and Mr. Bulane crawled back to the place where he and his son had originally been shot.   According to the information received, Ricky ran to alert his uncle, Mr. Richard Bulane, who went to help Rogelio Bulane but was hit by bullets from the soldiers. Three brothers of Richard followed him and were killed by gunshots from the soldiers.  On 7 March 2005, the survivors together with their families lodged a complaint before the Provincial Prosecution office in Digos City for murder and frustrated murder.  Action requestedPlease write to the authorities in the Philippines urging them to:  i.
