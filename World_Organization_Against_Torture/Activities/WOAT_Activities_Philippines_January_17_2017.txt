This reform would be an abdication of the Philippines’ commitment under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and would not be an effective way of addressing crime committed by children. The
Committee on the Rights of the Child has called on States to progressively raise the age of criminal responsibility, and has made it clear that a minimum age of criminal responsibility of nine is not internationally acceptable.
