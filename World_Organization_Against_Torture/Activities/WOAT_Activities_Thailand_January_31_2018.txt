The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a partnership of FIDH
and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent
intervention in the following situation in Thailand.
 
Brief
description of the situation:
 
The
Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the judicial harassment
of Mr. Sirawit Seritiwat, Ms. Nattha Mahatthana, Democracy
Restoration Group leader Mr. Rangsiman Rome, student activist Mr.
Netiwit Chotipatpaisal, human rights activist and former lese-majeste
detainee Mr. Ekachai Hongkangwan, human rights lawyer Mr. Anon Nampa,
and student activist Ms. Sukrit Piansuwan, for their involvement in the
organisation of a peaceful demonstration on January 27, 2018, in Bangkok.
 
According to
the information received, on January 30, 2018, Colonel Burin
Thongprapai, acting on behalf of Thailand’s ruling military junta, the National
Council for Peace and Order (NCPO), filed a complaint at Bangkok’s Pathumwan
Police Station against the seven activists. They are accused of “inciting
unrest” under Article 116 of the Criminal Code (‘sedition’) and of breaching Article
12 of NCPO Order 3/2015, which bans political gatherings of more than four
people. The violation of Article 116 is punishable with a prison term of up to
seven years. Article 12 of NCPO Order carries a penalty of up to six months in
prison, or a fine of up to 10,000 Baht (approximately 257 Euros), or both.
 
The seven
activists have been summoned to acknowledge the charges on February 2, 2018 at Bangkok’s
Pathumwan Police Station.
 
On January
27, 2018, the seven activists led a peaceful protest of several hundred people on
the Skywalk at Pathumwan intersection in central Bangkok. The protesters were demonstrating
against the likely postponement of Thailand’s general election until 2019[1].
NCPO Head General Prayuth Chan-ocha had previously pledged to hold the polls in
November 2018.
 
The
Observatory recalls that the Thai authorities have a long record of judicial
harassment against Mr. Rangsiman Rome[2],
Mr. Sirawit Seritiwat[3],
and Mr. Anon Nampa[4]. 
 
The
Observatory condemns the judicial harassment of Mr. Sirawit Seritiwat Ms. Nattha
Mahatthana, Mr. Rangsiman Rome,
Mr. Netiwit Chotipatpaisal,
Mr. Ekachai Hongkangwan,
Mr. Anon Nampa, and Ms.
Sukrit Piansuwan.
 
 
The
Observatory expresses concern over what seems to become a growing trend in
Thailand against freedoms of peaceful assembly and association[5],
and urges the Thai authorities to put an end to all forms of harassment,
including at the judicial level, against the seven human rights defenders,
which seems to only aim at punishing them for their peaceful and legitimate
human rights activities. 
 
 
Actions requested:
 
Please write
to the Thai authorities asking them to:
 
i. Put an end to all forms of harassment –
including at the judicial level – against Mr. Sirawit Seritiwat, Ms. Nattha Mahatthana, Mr. Rangsiman Rome, Mr. Netiwit Chotipatpaisal, Mr. Ekachai Hongkangwan, Mr. Anon Nampa, and Ms. Sukrit Piansuwan, as well as against all human rights defenders
in Thailand and ensure in all circumstances that they are able to carry out their
legitimate activities without any hindrance or fear of reprisals;
 
ii. Guarantee in all circumstances the right to freedom
of peaceful assembly and the right to freedom of opinion and expression
of all human rights defenders in Thailand; 
 
iii. Conform to the provisions of the UN
Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the
United Nations on December 9, 1998, in particular with Articles 1, 5(b), and 12.2;
 
iv.
Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms
in accordance with international human rights standards and international
instruments to which Thailand is a state party.
