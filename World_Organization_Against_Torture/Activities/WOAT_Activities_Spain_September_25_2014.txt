BRIEFING NOTE
Spain: Launch of the report
“Incommunicado detention and torture” in Madrid
Geneva,
24 September 2014. The OMCT participated last week, together with other
international and local human rights and medical organizations, in a seminar
held in Madrid, in the framework of which the report “Incomunicado detention
and torture” was presented for the first time. 
The study[1] applies the Istanbul
Protocol[2]
to 45 persons that alleged having been subject to torture and
ill-treatment during incommunicado detention in the counter-terrorism context
over the last thirty years.[3]A
multidisciplinary team of over 30 renowned medical professionals and
psychologists applied international forensic standards with a leading
compartimentalized methodology and advanced statistical techniques to ensure
objectivity and impartiality in the results. In a joint statement read out
during the presentation of the report, Juan E. Méndez, UN Special Rapporteur on
torture, and Ben Emmerson, UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion and
protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism,
pointed out the relevance of the study as “a step towards transparency and
accountability”.The
study had three main objectives: to assess the credibility of allegations of
torture under incommunicado detention using a large and significant sample; to
advance in the research of medical and psychological consequences of torture
and ill-treatment on the short, medium and long term; to identify and analyze
the torture methods to ascertain the existence or inexistence of patterns.According
to the experts that participated in the study, of the 45 assessments conducted,
53.3% qualified as of “maximum consistency”, 31.1% were “highly consistent” and
15.6% obtained a “consistent” degree of credibility. These numbers show a high
degree of credibility of the accounts of torture and ill-treatment and confirm
the findings of the Special Rapporteur on torture, the European Committee for
the Prevention of Torture (CPT), the UN Committee against Torture, and other
international human rights bodies pointing to the existence of credible and
consistent allegations of severe ill-treatment collected from detainees under
incommunicado detention.As
of the impact of the acts of torture and ill-treatment, it is noteworthy to draw
attention to the figures laid down in the report: 53% of the examinees had
showed Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms, 13.4% depressive
disorders, 6.7% anxiety disorders and 8.9% an enduring personality change.When
asked for measures of reparation, most of the examinees expressed that the main
and most urgent reparation measure would be the recognition of the facts: “that
torture exists” and the need to undertake effective measures to put an end to
it.According
to the latest report issued by the Basque Government (Framework Report on Human
Rights violations in the Basque Country (1960-2013), June 2013), there are approximately
5,500 torture cases that have been reported. Other reports count over 10,000
cases. During
the presentation, a documentary called “Voces [Voices]. Detention and torture
in the Basque Country”, that compiles the testimonies of several persons held
in incommunicado detention who participated in the study, was screened. The documentary
is available (in Spanish) on: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WXhr1TIN_4The
OMCT welcomes the report “Incommunicado detention and torture” in the Basque
Country and believes that it constitutes a valuable tool and a landmark example
of good practice in the field of the investigation of torture and other cruel,
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment using the Istanbul
Protocol. In this context, the OMCT hopes that the Spanish authorities draw on
the study and its conclusions to implement the recommendations of international
human rights bodies, among them: to put an end to the practice of incommunicado
detention; carry out prompt, effective and thorough investigations leading to
the prosecution and punishment of those responsible, whenever there is
reasonable ground to believe that prohibited acts have been committed; provide
full reparation to the victims, including compensation, rehabilitation, full
and public disclosure of the truth and guarantees of non-repetition to ensure
that the absolute prohibition of torture is upheld in all circumstances.
