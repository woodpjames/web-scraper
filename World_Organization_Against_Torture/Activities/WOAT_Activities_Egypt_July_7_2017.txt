		The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a 
partnership of FIDH and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), has 
received new information and requests your urgent intervention in the 
following situation in Egypt.


New information:


		The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the enforced 
disappearance while in detention of Mr. Tarek Hussein  
(known as Tito), human rights activist and lawyer at the Egyptian Center for 
Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) 
[1].

		 

		According to the information received, on July 4, 2017, Mr. Tarek Hussein 
who had been detained at Ain El-Shams Police Station since June 20, 2017, 
was set to be transferred to Imbaba Police Station. However, Imbaba Police 
Station has since been denying Mr. Tarek Hussein’s presence within 
their premises.

		 

		In addition, on July 6, 2017, the Prison Authority told Mr. Tarek 
Hussein’s family he was not being held in any of their facilities, but 
refused to provide written proof of this. As of publication of this appeal, 
no information on the whereabouts of Mr. Tarek Hussein was available.

		 

		Following his enforced disappearance while in detention, Mr. Tarek 
Hussein’s family has submitted a complaint before the National Council 
for Human Rights on July 6, 2017. In addition, on July 5, 2017 the 
Lawyers’ Syndicate has filed a complaint against the Minister of 
Interior regarding the various violations of of Mr. Tarek Hussein’s 
rights. Although at least one newspaper article quoted an anonymous Ministry 
of Interior source stating that Tito would be held until authorities were 
able to fully confirm that he was not implicated in any other cases, no 
formal, written response to any of the complaints submitted by the family or 
the Syndicate have been received.

		 

		Mr. Tarek Hussein was first arrested on June 17, 2017 by officers from the 
Central Security Forces. Although he was not shown any arrest warrant he was 
later accused of “joining an illegal organization” and 
“calling for a protest”. The following day, he was granted 
provisional release on bail but remained detained (see background 
information).

		 

		The Observatory expresses its outmost concerns over the enforced 
disappearance while in detention of Mr. Tarek Hussein and consequently urges 
the Egyptian authorities to immediately disclose his whereabouts and allow 
him access to his lawyer and family.

		 

		The Observatory further urges Egyptian authorities to immediately and 
unconditionally release Mr. Tarek Hussein as his detention is arbitrary and 
only aims at sanctioning his peaceful and legitimate human rights 
activities.

		 

Background information:

		 

		On June 17, 2017, at dawn fifteen masked and plain clothes officers from 
the Central Security Forces stormed out Mr. Tarek Hussein’s house, 
arrested him and confiscated his laptop and cell phone. During his arrest, 
Mr. Tarek Hussein requested to see the arrest warrant but was not shown any 
and was physically and verbally assaulted instead, including upon his 
arrival at Khanka’s police station.

		 

		He was subsequently brought before the Al-Khanka District Prosecution, 
where he was accused of “joining an illegal organization” and 
“calling for a protest”.

		 

		On June 18, 2017, the Al-Khanka District Prosecution ordered Mr. Tarek 
Hussein’s release on a 2000 EGP (approx. 99 euros) bail, which has 
been duly paid. However, as of publication of this appeal the latter had not 
been released yet and is still held at Khanka’s police station.


		In addition, allegations of ill-treatment including physical and verbal 
assault were reported while in detention. It has been reported that Mr. 
Tarek Hussein is being detained in poor conditions which include sharing an 
overcrowded cell with eighty co-detainees, and being denied food and 
changing clothes for two consecutive days. Mr. Hussein’s relatives, 
who have been in contact with the prison’s authorities, were told that 
“he deserves to die”.

		 

		Mr. Tarek Hussein’s arrest and arbitrary detention occur amidst 
protest over Tiran and Sanafir islands’ transfer to Saudi Arabia, 
which he has been vocally opposing 
[2].
