PRESS RELEASE                         
At 
least 
13 
dead 
and 
dozens 
wounded 
during 
demonstrations 
in 
Kazakhstan 
Paris-Geneva, 
21 December 
2011 
– The 
International 
Federation 
for 
Human 
Rights 
(FIDH) 
and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) are alarmed over reports on 
the 
excessive use 
of 
force 
against  demonstrators 
in 
the 
Manghystau 
region and the detentions 
that followed. 
The 
last 
days 
have 
seen 
at 
least 
13 
deaths 
and 
dozens 
of 
injuries 
as 
State 
violence. 
We 
join 
the appeal made by Kazakhstani 
human 
rights 
organisations[1] 
for 
a 
transparent, 
thorough 
and 
impartial 
investigation 
into 
the 
unrest 
and 
the 
use 
of 
deadly 
force. 

On 
16 
December, 
around 
100-150 
protesters 
gathered 
on 
the 
central 
square 
in 
Janaozen 
to 
demand 
respect 
for 
their 
labour 
rights, 
including 
the 
right 
to 
organise 
an 
independent 
labour 
union, 
equal 
rights 
for 
foreign 
workers, 
and 
wage 
increases. 
Peaceful protests 
have 
been 
taking 
place 
since 
May 
2011 
after 
a thousand 
workers 
were 
fired. 
On 
16 
December, 
commemorations 
of 
the 
20th 
anniversary 
of 
Kazakhstan's 
independence 
were 
also 
organised 
on 
the 
square. 
In 
the 
course 
of 
demonstrations 
protesters 
set 
fire 
to 
a 
tribune 
and 
a 
new 
years' 
tree 
as 
well 
as 
several 
buildings, 
including 
the 
offices 
of 
OzenMunaiGaz 
oil 
company. 
These 
acts 
culminated 
in 
clashes 
with 
security 
forces 
who 
reportedly 
opened 
fire 
on 
the 
crowd. 
The 
Prosecutor-General's 
Office 
has 
stated 
that 
these 
clashes 
have 
resulted 
in 
13 
protesters 
dead 
and 
86 
wounded 
persons. 

On 
17 
December, 
protestors 
blocked 
the 
Mangyshlaq-Aktau 
railway 
at 
the 
Shetpe 
station 
to 
denounce 
the 
shooting 
of 
demonstrators 
the 
previous 
day. 
Ordered 
to 
disperse 
these 
demonstrators, 
the police 
shot 
one 
demonstrator 
in 
the 
head 
and 
wounded 
at 
least 
a 
dozen 
others. 
A 
number 
of 
persons 
were 
hospitalised, 
some 
in 
critical 
condition. 
On 
the 
same 
day, 
President 
Nursultan 
Nazabaev 
decreed 
a 
state 
of 
emergency 
and 
imposed 
a 
curfew 
in 
Janaozen. 
Declaring 
that 
the 
police 
had 
had 
to 
protect 
public 
order 
against 
the 
disruption 
of 
“hooligans”, 
President Nazabaev 
stated 
that 
the 
situation 
was 
“under 
control”. 
The 
security 
measures 
put 
in 
place 
on 
17 
December 
will 
persist 
until 
5 
January 
2012.
Further 
protests 
organised 
in 
the 
region's 
capital, 
Aktau, 
on 
18 
December, 
were 
closely 
monitored 
by 
armoured 
vehicles 
and 
security 
troops. 
In 
the 
town 
of 
Jetibai, 
oil 
workers 
started 
a 
strike 
to 
protest 
the 
use 
of 
force 
against 
demonstrators 
and 
demand 
investigation 
into 
Janaozen 
shootings. 

“We 
also 
strongly 
denounce 
the 
fact 
that 
not 
only 
did 
security 
forces 
open 
fire 
on 
the 
protestors, 
but 
they 
also 
barred 
access 
to 
journalists 
to 
the 
places 
where 
the 
events 
occurred, 
in 
order 
to 
avoid 
free 
and 
impartial 
reporting 
on 
the 
events” 
declared 
FIDH 
President 
Souhayr 
Belhassen.
Journalists 
arriving 
at 
Aktau 
on 
18 
December 
were 
prohibited 
from 
travelling 
to 
Janaozen 
from 
where 
all 
telephone 
communication 
had 
been 
cut 
since 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
clashes 
on 
16 
December. 
According 
to 
reliable 
sources, 
blogger, 
Murat 
Tungyshbaev, 
was 
reportedly 
beaten 
up 
by 
security 
forces 
at 
Shetpe 
station.
“We 
are 
alarmed 
by 
the 
lack 
of 
access 
to 
the 
city 
which 
prevents 
any 
independent 
assessment 
of 
the 
true 
scope 
of 
possible 
human 
rights 
abuses, 
including 
arbitrary 
detentions. 
It 
is 
essential 
to 
allow 
independent 
observers, 
journalists 
and 
human 
rights 
organisations 
to 
the 
city”, 
said 
Gerald 
Staberock, 
Secretary 
General 
of 
OMCT.
