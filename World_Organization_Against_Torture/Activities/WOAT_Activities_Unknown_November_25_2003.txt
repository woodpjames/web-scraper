It aims to ensure that this important international human rights mechanism addresses the specific rights and situations of children worldwide in its regular work and annual sessions on human rights. By advocating for the inclusion of its concerns into the Commission's resolutions, the NGO community can further ensure better support and coherence between international politics and local realities affecting the realisation of children's rights. OMCT coordinates the subgroup throughout the year to effectively make an impact on the Commission by undertaking the following activities : • Facilitate the preparation of NGO proposals to the text of the "Omnibus Resolution" on the Rights of the Child • Lobby with the government sponsors of the resolution on the Rights of the Child to include NGO proposals to the text • Lobby for children's rights issues to be reflected in other resolutions • Co-organise side events on children's issues during the Commission • Coordinate and organise the Children's Human Rights Caucus activities during the Commission • Provide the NGO community and wider public information on the Commission on children's rights and related issues Each year at the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, OMCT is thus involved in intense lobbying activity both as convenor of the subgroup and as an NGO specialised in the fight against torture and violence against children. With this in mind, close contacts are established with various States involved in the resolution on the rights of the child. Similar approaches are made in connection with resolutions on the right to education, torture and juvenile justice. The Children's Human Rights Caucus convened by OMCT produces and disseminate reports, timetables, administrative information and flyers to a list of 170 contacts and also make them available on the CRIN web-site, both on the international treaties/CHR page, which includes an overview of the process, a description of the CHR, information about the various resolutions, involvement by NGOs, as well as contacts and links, and on the Subgroup page. • Children's Rights Caucus 2002 Report • Children's Rights Caucus 2003 Report • Children's Rights Caucus 2004 Report
