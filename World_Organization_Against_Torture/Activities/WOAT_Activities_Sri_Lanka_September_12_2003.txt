Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Asian Human Rights Commission, a member of the OMCT network, of a 50-year-old father of five who was killed by the police after arrest and torture in Sri Lanka.   According to the information received, on September 5th, 2003, Mr. Okanda Hevage Jinadasa was stopped when returning home from work on his bicycle by two Grama Arakshaka personnel [paramilitaries] from the Okkampitiya Police Post. The officers searched his belongings and found two packets of illicit liquor, equaling 284ml, in his possession. They proceded to beat him and brought him to the Okkampitiya Police Post. At the Police Post they subjected him to severe torture, including beating him again with fists and poles and squeezing his testicles and neck until he died. Police personnel took his dead body to the Okkampitiya government rural hospital, under the pretense that they thought he was unconscious. The doctor who examined his body pronounced that he had died before being brought to the hospital.   The police reportedly said that Mr. Jinadasa fell from a chair and died. The Monaragala magistrate who held the inquiry on September 7th, 2003 ordered that the body be sent to Karapitiya [Galle] Teaching Hospital for an autopsy. The Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) who did the autopsy reported to the magistrate that he found injuries on the victim's body caused by blunt weapons. The JMO further stated that the victim's death was not due to these injuries. The JMO has reserved his decision on the cause of death till further investigation is completed. According to the report of the JMO, the Monaragala Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) has arrested two Grama Arakshaka personnel for questioning. They are still being held at the police station but no serious action to investigate this case has yet been taken by the police.   In the meantime, the Inspector General of Police (IGP) recently issued a circular stating that all Officers in Charge (OICs) and other high-ranking officers should take responsibility for custodial deaths and torture that take place at police stations. The perpetrators should be brought to justice and high-ranking officers should take responsibility for this incident in terms of the IGP's circular.  The International Secretariat of the OMCT wishes to express its deep concern for the death of Mr. Jinadasa and fears that there is a high risk of torture occurring in the custody of the Sri-Lankan police.  OMCT calls upon the Sri-Lankan authorities to bring an end to these acts and to enforce the dispositions of its Constitution and international conventions.  Action requested  Please write to the authorities in Sri Lanka urging them to:  i.   guarantee that adequate reparation is provided to the Mr. Jinadasa’s family; ii.  take all necessary measures to ensure respect for the international human rights instruments to which Sri Lankan civilians are party, which includes respect for the prohibition of torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment and punishment, such as the practice of corporal punishment; iii. order a thorough and impartial investigation into the circumstances of these arrests,  in order to identify those responsible, bring them to trial and apply the penal and/or administrative sanctions as provided by law; iv.  guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
