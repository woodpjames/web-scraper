Brief description of the situation  The Observatory has been informed by the National Society for Human Rights, (NSHR), a member of the OMCT network, of the harassment of human rights activist, Moses Nasilele, head of NSHR regional monitoring office (RMO) at Katima Mulilo, Caprivi region.  According to the information received, on February 28th 2000, Moses Nasilele was temporarily held for questioning by alleged members of the National Central Intelligence Service (NCIS) who accused him of holding «a meeting» at his office in the town.    The Observatory notes that these incidents are part of a general state of insecurity.  Indeed, the Observatory recalls that following the imposition of a state of emergency in the region last year , on 2nd August 1999, human rights defender Gabriel Mwilima was arrested in the Caprivi strip and allegedly severely beaten. It is reported that he is currently held in Grootfontein prison on charges of high treason.  Furthermore, Joseph Muchali, another NSHR activist from Caprivi region, has disappeared without trace after Namibian security forces allegedly detained him on August 6, 1999.  The Observatory fears that the disappearance of Joseph Muchali, the arrest of Moses Nasilele and the charges against Gabriel Mwilima are due to their activities in defence of human rights.   Action requested :  Please write to the Namibian authorities urging them to:  i.-	guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of Moses Nasilele and Gabriel Mwilima and locate the whereabouts of Joseph Muchali and order his immediate release;  ii.-	adopt all necessary measures in order to ensure full freedom of action of human rights organisations including trade union organisations as well as their members;  iii.-	to conform to the arrangements of the Declaration of Human Rights Defenders adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on the 9 December 1998, and notably by Article 1 which states that « Everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels» and Article 6.b which stipulates that « Everyone has the right, individually and in association with others (...), to publish, impart or disseminate to others views, information and knowledge on all human rights and fundamental freedoms ».    iv.-	to conform, more generally, to the dispositions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the international pacts relative to Human Rights which bind Namibia.
