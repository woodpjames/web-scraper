The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint
programme of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and
the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), has received new information and
requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in Egypt.
 
New information:
 
The Observatory has been informed by the Egyptian Initiative for
Personal Rights (EIPR), about the indictment of 24 activists and human rights
defenders, detained since June 21, 2014 for their alleged participation in a
peaceful march calling for the repeal of Law 107 of 2013 on demonstrations and
public rallies (the “Anti-Protest Law”) and for the release of those detained
under said law. Those indicted include women human rights defenders Ms. Yara
Sallam, Transitional Justice Officer at EIPR, and Ms. Sana Seif, a
member of the “No to Military Trials for Civilians” movement and sister of
the imprisonment blogger Mr. Alaa Abdel Fattah.
 
According to the information received, on June 25, 2014, the Heliopolis
Public Prosecution transferred the case of the 24 activists to the Heliopolis
Misdemeanor Court, which scheduled the first hearing for June 29, 2014.
 
The Prosecution has included 12 provisions in the indictment order of
the 24 activists: articles 162, 361, 375(bis), 375(bisA) of the Penal Code,
articles 1 to 4 of Law 10 for 1914 on Gatherings; and articles 7, 8, 19, 21 of
Law No.107 for 2013 on demonstrations and public rallies. These provisions
include: “participating in an unauthorised demonstration whose aim was to stop
the implementation of the law and influence the effectiveness of the public
authorities during the carrying out of their work”; “organising a demonstration
without prior notice as stipulated by the law and participating in a
demonstration that breached and threatened public security and the interests of
citizens and disrupted transportation and transgressed public and private
property”; “using force and violence to terrorise and intimidate citizens”; and
“deliberately destructing property owned by the aggrieved party as proven
through investigations”. 
 
On June 24, 2014, the two women human rights defenders as well as five
other women activists had been transferred to Qanatir Prison, 15 male detainees
to Tora Prison, and one juvenile to Al-Marg juvenile prison. This followed the
extension by the prosecution of the detention of these 23 individuals on June
23, 2014 for four days, as well as the release on bail of another one on the
same day (see background information).
 
The Observatory recalls that the restrictive protest law has been used
by the authorities as a tool to imprison human rights defenders. This
controversial law bans gatherings of 10 or more people without a permit issued
by the authorities. Ms. Maheinour Al Masry is currently in detention
after the sentence issued against her in absentia on January 2,
2014, convicting her to two years’ imprisonment and a fine of EGP 50,000
(approximately EUR 5,143)[1].
Mr. Alaa Abdel Fattah, who
is currently in detention, was sentenced along side Mr. Ahmed Abdel
Rahman and 23 other individuals, to 15 years of prison, a
fine of LE 100,000 (approximately EUR 10,420) and five years of police
surveillance[2]. Founders of the April 6 Youth Movement, Mr. Ahmed Maher
and Mr. Mohamed Adel, were also sentenced to three years of prison and a
50,000 EGP fine by the Cairo Criminal Court on December 22, 2013 for organising
an unauthorised protest and allegedly attacking police forces in November 2013[3].

 
The Observatory expresses its deepest concern regarding the ongoing
arbitrary detention and judicial harassment of Ms. Yara Sallam, Ms. Sana Seif and
the other above-mentioned activists, which seem to aim only at preventing them
from carrying out their peaceful human rights activities, and calls upon the
Egyptian judicial authorities to immediately and unconditionally release them. 
 
Background information:
 
On June 23, 2014, the Heliopolis Prosecution Office ordered the
detention until June 25, 2014 of Ms. Yara Sallam, Ms. Sana Seif as well as 21
other individuals on charges of “breaching the protest law” under the
“Anti-Protest Law, “sabotaging public properties”, “possession of inflammable
materials” and “taking part in showing off force with the objective of
terrorizing the public” for their alleged participation in a peaceful march.
 
On June 21, 2014, the police dispersed by using
tear gas a peaceful march that was organised in the
Heliopolis neighbourhood in Cairo to demand the repeal of the “Anti-Protest
Law” as well as the release of those detained under said law. In this
framework, the police arrested more than 30 individuals, including Ms. Yara Sallam
and her cousin Shehab Fakhry Ismail. It should
be highlighted that the two were picked up in the vicinity of the protest
between 7 and 8 pm by security forces as they were buying drinks from a local
kiosk and not while participating in any demonstration. 
 
Some of the detainees reported insults and ill-treatment, including
beatings by “muwatinin shurafa” (plain-clothed police collaborators) during and
after the arrest . Those arrested were questioned without the presence of their
lawyers, mostly individually, by men in civilian dress who did not introduce
themselves or clarify their official positions. The arrestees were asked
whether they participated in the protest and were questioned about their
political affiliations and opinions about the protest law. According to
testimonies, officials pressured them into confessing their participation and
threatened to charge them with belonging to the banned Muslim Brotherhood
and/or the 6th of April Movement. Later the same day, eight of the arrestees
were released without charge, including Ms. Sallam's cousin. On June 22, 2014,
24 were presented before the Prosecutor’s office.
 
During her interrogation, Ms. Sallam was questioned about the nature of
her work and about EIPR's management.
 
Actions requested:
 
Please write to the authorities of Egypt asking them to:
 
i.              
Guarantee in all
circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Ms. Yara Sallam and
Ms. Sana Seif, as well as all the 21 other detained for their alleged
participation in said march and all human rights defenders in Egypt;
 
ii.             
Release Ms. Yara Sallam and Ms. Sana Seif, as well as the 21 other detained
for their alleged participation in said march
immediately and unconditionally, as well as all human rights defenders currently in detention, since their detention is arbitrary as it seems to only aim at curtailing
their human rights activities; 
 
iii.           
Put an end to all acts
of harassment, including at the judicial level, against Ms. Yara Sallam and Ms.
Sana Seif, as well as the 22 others indicted for their alleged participation in
said march
and all human rights defenders in Egypt;
 
iv.    Comply with all the provisions of the United Nations Declaration on
Human Rights Defenders, in particular with:
-     
its Article 1, which
provides that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with
others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realization of human
rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”;
-     
its Article 5(a): “For
the purpose of promoting and protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms,
everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, at the
national and international levels (a) To meet or assemble peacefully”
-     
its Article 6(a), which
foresees that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with
others, to participate in peaceful activities against violations of human
rights and fundamental freedoms”;
-     
its Article 12.2, which
provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the
protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in
association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de
facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other
arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the
rights referred to in the present Declaration”;
 
v.     Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental
freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and
international instruments ratified by Egypt.
