Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Asian Human Rights  Commission of the killing of ten supporters of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC), in Sri Lanka’s Katugastota district, following recent parliamentary elections.  According to the information received, at around 5:30pm on December 5th, 2001, ten SLMC supporters escorted election officials who were transporting a ballot box from the Madawala polls in the Katugastota district to the counting centre in Kandy.  En route, a “thug squad” allegedly under control of Lohan Ratwatte, the son of the former Peoples’ Alliance’s (PA) Deputy Defence Minister Anurudda Ratwatte, ran the vehicle off the road, where it crashed into a lamppost.   The perpetrators subsequently approached the vehicle, opened the doors, and shot the ten SLMC supporters at point blank range, before fleeing the scene.  The names and ages of the ten supporters are:  1. T. M. Fisar (24) 2. F.M. Rizwan (27) 3. M.R.M. Nazir (25) 4. A.M.M. Mohideen (31) 5. A.M.Milsar (23) 6. Z.M. Nazar (19) 7. M.I.M. Ashwar (26) 8. M. Riswan (23) 9. I.M.I. Fasar Yahamod (25) 10.M. Mohamad (25)  According to the information received, high standing representatives within the SLMC, along with other civil society organizations, have also publicly alleged that Lohan Ratwatte is responsible for these killings.  During the October 2000 General Election, Mr. Ratwatte was also accused of similar mass scale voter intimidation and ballot rigging.    According to the information received, following the December 7th confirmation of the United National Party as the new government, Lohan Ratwatte reportedly fled the Island with his wife and two children, as his father, Anuruddha Ratwatte, had lost his seat in the Kandy district.    The International Secretariat of OMCT is deeply concerned by these killings as they appear to have been conducted primarily for political reasons.  More generally, OMCT is gravely concerned about the continuing trend of voter intimidation and murder during elections in Sri Lanka.  Action requested  Please write to the authorities in Sri Lanka urging them to:  i.   guarantee adequate restitution, and compensation to the families of the ten SLMC supporters killed; ii.  order a thorough and impartial investigation into the circumstances of these killings in order to identify those responsible, bring them to trial and apply the penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions as provided by law; iii. guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
