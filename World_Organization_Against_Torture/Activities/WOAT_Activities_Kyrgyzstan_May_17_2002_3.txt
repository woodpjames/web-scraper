Brief description of the facts :  The Observatory has been informed by the Kyrgyz Committee for Human Rights (KCHR), that M. Ramazan Dyryldaev, Chairman of KCHR and other human rights defenders were released from detention on 17th May 2002. They had been arrested yesterday, May 16th, 2002 at 9.00 am, together with more than 90 people, during a peaceful demonstration in Bishkek, in front of the Parliament of the Kyrgyz Republic and taken to the district department of the Ministry of the Interior in Bishkek.   The persons arrested were protesting against the ratification by the Parliament, on 10th May, of the Agreement signed between Kyrgyzstan and China, according to which a part of Kyrgyz territory was transferred to China, in contradiction with the Kyrgyz Constitution. They were also demanding the truth concerning the identification of the persons responsible for the violent repression of the demonstration that took place on 17th March and during which 6 people were killed and 40 injured.   According to the information received, those arrested stayed in cameras until the morning, most of them were beaten up and some of them even got injured. The lawyer of KCHR M. Jakishev had to be taken to hospital. Allegedly, representatives of the militia forcefully made people sign documents against them. They are charged for “violation of public order” and lawsuits are meant to start soon.  The Observatory is pleased to announce this release and thanks all individuals and organisations who intervened. However it remains concerned about the situation of human rights defenders and NGOs in Kyrgyzstan and will monitor future developments, in particular that all guarantees of a fair trial are respected if those arrested are brought to trial.    **************** Geneva-Paris, 17th May 2002  Kindly inform us of any action undertaken, quoting the reference number given above.
