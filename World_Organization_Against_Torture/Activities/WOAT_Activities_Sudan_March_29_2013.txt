The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of
the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation
Against Torture (OMCT), requests
your urgent intervention in the following situation in Sudan.
 
Brief description of the situation:
 
The Observatory has been informed by the African Centre For Justice and Peace Studies (ACJPS) about the arbitrary arrest and incommunicado detention of youth activist Mr. Hatim Ali Abdalla and the
police harassment of Mr. Khalid Omer Yousif, Spokesperson for the
Sudanese youth movement Sudan Change Now.
 
According to the information received,
on March 23, 2013, Mr. Abdalla was arrested at
1 pm by the police during a peaceful demonstration held before the Khartoum
Bahri Hospital. The demonstration, attended
by roughly 50 people, was organised by several doctors’ unions to protest a
recent decree issued by the Khartoum Minister of Health ordering the closure of
several public hospitals. He was taken to Khartoum
Bahri police station. He was released at around 12.30am on March 24, and
ordered to report to the Political Section of the National Intelligence and
Security Services (NISS) offices in Khartoum Bahri at 8.30am the same day. On
24 March, Mr. Abdalla reported to the NISS as instructed and has been detained
incommunicado ever since. When his family requested to visit him, they were
reportedly told by the NISS to return in fourteen days. The nature of criminal
charges against him, if any, and his exact whereabouts are not known. 
 
Mr. Abdalla has reportedly been arrested more than two
times, but released without charge, in the last year. 
 
On March 23, Mr. Khalid Omer Yousif was also
summoned to the Political Section of the NISS offices in Khartoum Bahri and
interrogated about his role in the demonstrations. He was released at midnight
the same day and ordered to report back to the NISS offices on the morning of
March 24, where he waited until 5pm without being interviewed. He was
subsequently ordered to report back to the NISS office on the mornings of March
25 and 26, after which he was told that the investigation against him had
concluded and he was no longer required to report to the NISS. 
 
The Observatory
expresses its deepest concerns about these acts of harassment and is deeply concerned by  Mr. Hatim Ali Abdalla's
incommunicado detention and fears for his physical and psychological integrity,
particularly in the current context of widespread resort to acts of torture and
ill-treatment in NISS detention centres in Sudan. The Observatory calls upon
the Sudanese authorities to take prompt action in order to disclose his fate
and whereabouts, ensure his access to his family and lawyer and release him
immediately as it believes that his arrest merely aims at sanctioning his human rights activities.
 
Actions requested:
 
The
Observatory urges the authorities of Sudan to: 
 i. Guarantee in
all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Messrs. Hatim Ali Abdalla and Khalid Omer Yousif, as well as of all
human rights defenders in Sudan;ii. Take prompt action in order to disclose the fate and whereabouts of Mr. Hatim Ali Abdalla and to unconditionally release him, as his detention is arbitrary since it only aims
at sanctioning their human rights activities;
iii. Immediately grant Mr. Hatim Ali Abdalla access to his family and lawyers;
 
iv. Put an end to any
kind of harassment, including at the judicial level, against Messrs. Hatim Ali Abdalla and Khalid Omer Yousif, as well as against all
human rights defenders in Sudan, and ensure in all circumstances that they are
able to carry out their activities without hindrances;
 
v. Conform in any
circumstances with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights
Defenders, in particular its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the
right, individually or in association with others, to promote the protection
and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and
international levels”, and its article 12.2 which provides that “the State
shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent
authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against
any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination,
pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her
legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”; 
 
vi. Ensure in all circumstances
respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with
international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by
Sudan.
