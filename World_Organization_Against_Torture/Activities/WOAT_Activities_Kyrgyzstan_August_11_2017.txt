Restriction
of property rights
Kyrgyzstan
August 10, 2017
 
The Observatory for the
Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a partnership of FIDH and the World
Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), has received new information and requests
your urgent intervention in the following situation in Kyrgyzstan.
 
New information:
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the unlawful
restriction of property rights of
the Director of the human rights organisation “Vozdukh” (Air) Mr. Azimjan Askarov, who currently serves a
life sentence in the Pre-trial detention centre in Bishkek. 
 
According to the information received, on August 16, 2017, Bazar Korgon District
Court of Jalal Abad Oblast will consider the lawsuit filed by Mr. Azimjan Askarov requesting the
court to release the family main residence house from seizure[1].  
 
The Observatory
recalls that on September 15, 2010, the Bazar Korgon District Court had ordered
the confiscation of Mr. Azimjan Askarov’s property as part of a life sentence
handed down against him which was upheld by
the Chuy Regional Court of Kyrgyzstan on January 24, 2017[2]. However,
the Penal Enforcement Code of Kyrgyzstan (Annex to the Section VII, Chapter 22)
prohibits confiscating convicted person's main residence or the main residence
of convicted person’s family members. Mr. Azimjan Askarov’s house, where his
wife lives, is their only residence and therefore according to Kyrgyz law is
not subject to confiscation and therefore nor to seizure[3].

 
Since 2010, the
Prosecutor's Office of Bazar-Korgon District has conducted to several visits in
view of confiscating Mr. Azimjan Askarov's house.   
 
On May 25, 2016,
shortly after the United Nations (UN) Human Rights Committee (CCPR) requested
Kyrgyzstan to release Mr. Azimjan Askarov, the court bailiffs and representatives of the State Property Fund of
Kyrgyzstan (SPFK) led a visit at Azimjan Askarov’s house and took photos of the
property. SPFK explained to Mr. Askarov's wife that they were implementing a
decision adopted on April 27, 2016 to execute the confiscation order.
 
Then Mr.
Askarov's lawyer filed a lawsuit before the Inter-district Court of Bishkek
requesting it to declare the abovementioned SPFK decision unlawful. Before the
case was brought to trial, on September 26, 2016, SPFK annulled its decision. 
 
Despite multiple
requests from Mr. Askarov's lawyers, the Office of the Prosecutor General of
the Kyrgyz Republic has still not released Askarov's house from seizure. 
 
The Observatory thus expresses its concern over the
ongoing unlawful restriction of property rights of Mr. Azimjan Askarov and
considers this unlawful measure as a means of harassment and pressure on the
human rights defender and his family. Furthermore, the Observatory reiterates
its call to implement the UN CCPR Opinion and release immediately and
unconditionally Azimjan Askarov. 
 
Background information:
 
As the Director of the human rights organisation
“Vozdukh” (Air), Mr. Azimjan Askarov has been documenting police
ill-treatment of detainees and monitoring the human rights situation in the
province of Jalal-Abad, in particular the mass violence in Bazar Korgon in June
2010.
 
On June 15, 2010, Mr. Askarov was arbitrarily
arrested by agents of Bazar Korgon police department for allegedly having urged
ethnic Uzbeks to take the district official Mr. A. Artykov hostage, for
having ordered the blockade of the Bishkek-Osh highway and for urged to attack
police officers. One of the attacks caused the death of a policeman
Mr. Sulaimanov.
 
On September 15, 2010, following an unfair trial,
Mr. Askarov was sentenced to life imprisonment after he was found guilty
of complicity in Mr. Sulaimanov’s murder. The trial was marred with
irregularities, including alleged torture and the courtroom intimidation of
witnesses by police and of lawyers by the audience. Mr. Askarov and the
other defendants had pleaded not guilty during the trial. His lawyer,
Mr. Nurbek Toktakunov, asked for a medical examination, which was denied.
According to family members of the suspects and human rights organisations, all
of them were subjected to acts of torture and ill-treatment by prison guards in
custody and presented visible physical injuries.
 
On November 10, 2010, the court of appeal upheld the
life sentence of Mr. Azimjan Askarov following a trial marred by
irregularities. At that time the health of Mr. Askarov had already
severely deteriorated.
 
On January 26, 2011, the defence lawyers requested the
Supreme Court to examine and include new evidence in the criminal case,
including a testimony made by Ms. Aziza Abdirasulova, Director of the human
rights organisation Kylym Shamy, that showed that, in May 2010,
Mr. Azimjan Askarov had warned the authorities that acts of violence were
being prepared in Bazar Korgon. According to Mr. Azimjan Askarov’s lawyer
Nurbek Toktakunov, this warning might have triggered the fabrication of this
case. In addition, defence lawyer Kairat Zagibaev provided evidence showing
that Mr. Askarov was not present at the scene where the incidents took
place. The Supreme Court accepted the new evidence. On February 8, 2011, the
same Court decided to open an investigation into the conditions of detention in
Kyrgyzstan, especially in provisional detention centres, and to suspend sine
die the trial against Mr. Askarov. This decision was taken following a
petition made by Mr. Nurbek Toktakunov, lawyer of Mr. Askarov, on the
appalling conditions of detention of his client and other prisoners in the
temporary detention facilities of Bazar Korgon, which have hampered the
preparation of the defence.
 
In October 2011, Mr. Askarov’s defence team
conducted a private investigation and gathered evidence pointing to the
innocence of the latter and reporting use of torture and inhuman treatment
against him.
 
On December 20, 2011, the Supreme Court upheld the
sentence to life imprisonment. After years of pressure, in May 2013, a new
investigation was ordered by the Vice Prosecutor General of the Kyrgyzstan
Republic, but was closed nine months later for lack of legal basis.
 
On September 3, 2014, the Supreme Court reversed the
Bishkek District Court decision of April 30, 2014 which was in favour of a
re-opening Mr. Askarov’s case. The hearing was marked by acts of
intimidation against Mr. Askarov. It is reported that several unidentified
individuals stopped the hearing and brought the convict outside of the
courtroom to talk privately.
 
On April 21, 2016, the CCPR confirmed that Mr. Azimjan
Askarov was tortured, subject to inhuman conditions while in pre-trial
detention and that his trial did not respect minimum international fair trial
standards. The CCPR urged Kyrgyzstan to immediately release Mr. Azimjan
Askarov.
 
On July 11 and 12, 2016, the Kyrgyzstan Supreme Court heard the appeal that had been filed by
the lawyers of Mr. Azimjan Askarov
under Article 41.2 of the Constitution, which obliges Kyrgyzstan to restore
human rights in the event that international bodies confirm a violation, and
ordered a fresh appeal hearing before the Chuy Regional Court in Bishkek in the
case of human rights defender Azimjan Askarov, and left his life sentence
conviction unchanged.
 
On January 24,
2017, the Chuy Regional Court of Kyrgyzstan confirmed the life sentence against
Mr. Azimjan Askarov following a trial marked by bias and procedural
irregularities, including court refusal to hear some defence witnesses,
inaction towards threats and violent behavior of deceased police officer's
wife, restrictions to access to the courtroom, failure to investigate credible
allegations of torture and ignoring acts of pressure and intimidation targeting
defence witnesses and lawyers.
