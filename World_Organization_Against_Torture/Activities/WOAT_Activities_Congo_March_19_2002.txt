Brief description:  The Observatory was informed of the arrest of Doctor Collette Kitoga, coordinator of the psycho - medical center - CMM -, on 8th May, by agents of the National Intelligency Service of the Congolese Assembly for Democracy (RDC/Goma) in Bukavu, at the very time she return from Geneva, where she had participated in the 56th United Nations Commission on Human Rights.  According to the information received from the Collective of Actions for the Developement of Human Rights (CADDHOM) -, on 8th May 2000, from 13.00 p.m to 18.30 p.m., Doctor Collette Kitoga has been interrogated by  the security services of the Congolese Rally for Democracy.  According to the same information, Doctor Collette Kitoga's passport has been seized by Mr. Serubuye, chief division of the National Intelligence Service (ARN), the day she crossed the Rwando-Congolese border at Ruzizi, for having allegedly left the RDC territory without permission. Her passport is still retained although Mrs Kitoga was released after five hours of interrogation. According to these information, Collette Kitoga was requested to present herself at the ARN office on 10th May in order to continue the examination of her file. On this occasion, she would have been interviewed once again about the activities of her organization, the « CMM ». Finally, the handing back of her passport required the payment of $100  penalty, and the expression of her recognition that she committed a "fault" when she left the territory to go to the IRCT conference in Zimbabwe. With regards to the circumstances and persistant threats towards human rights defenders and their activities, the Observatory fears for Mrs Collette Kitoga’s security and freedom as well as the work of her organization, the «CMM» which provides assistance to victims of torture and ill-treatment.
