Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by a reliable source of the arrest and disappearance of Mrs. Valarmathy Sriskantharajah (aged 42) and her two children aged 15 and 12 (see case LKA 280100.CC), on 25th January 2000, at their home in Urumpirai, by Sri Lankan Police forces who reportedly came with a Militia Group EPDP members (Eelam People’s Democratic Front).  Her husband, Mr. Sriskantharajah (aged 45) currently resides in Switzerland having claimed refugee status in 1991.  The reason for their arrest is believed to be that her eldest son, arrested in Colombo on Saturday 22nd January 2000, is a suspected member of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.    The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned for their physical and psychological integrity, particularly as it is reported by the family physician that Mrs. Sriskantharajah is of weak health and that her son, Vinoth, suffers from fits.  Their current whereabouts is unknown.  Actions requested  Please write to the authorities of Sri Lanka urging them to:  i.	take all necessary measures to guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of Mrs. Sriskantharajah and her two children;  ii.	immediately locate their whereabouts and order their immediate release in the absence of valid legal charges or, if such charges exist, bring them before an impartial and competent tribunal and guarantee their procedural rights in all times;  iii.	order a thorough and impartial investigation into the arrest and disappearance of Mrs. Sriskantharajah and her two children in order to identify those responsible, bring them to trial and apply the penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions as provided by law;  iv.	guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
