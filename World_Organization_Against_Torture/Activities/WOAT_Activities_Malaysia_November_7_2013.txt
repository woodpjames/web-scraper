The Observatory for the Protection of Human
Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the World Organisation Against Torture
(OMCT) and the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), has received
new information and requests your urgent intervention in the following
situation in Malaysia.
 
New
information:
The Observatory has been informed by reliable
sources about the ongoing judicial harassment against Ms. Lena Hendry, Programme Coordinator of the human rights NGO Pusat KOMAS[1],
in relation to the organisation of a private screening of the documentary film
called “No Fire Zone, the Killing Fields of
Sri Lanka” on allegations of war crimes committed in Sri Lanka during the civil
war in 2009.
 
According to the information
received, on November 7, 2013, Ms. Lena Hendry’s lawyers went to Magistrate
Court 6, Duta Court Complex, in Kuala Lumpur. However, the lawyers were then
informed that the case was postponed as the Presiding Magistrate was on medical
leave.

The Observatory recalls that on September 19, 2013, the Home Ministry and
Attorney General Chamber (AGC) filed a charge against Ms. Lena Hendry under
Section 6 of the Film Censorship Act 2002 - which says no one should screen any film or related
publicity materials that have not been approved by the Censorship Board. Judge
Ashraf Razal Abdul Manan granted her bail of 1,000 ringgit (about 233 euros),
and set the next date for Ms. Hendry to appear in court to October 21, 2013. On that day, documents including the charge sheet, the police
report, the layout of the venue where the documentary was shown, and a copy of
the film in DVD format were provided to the court.
 
If convicted, Ms. Hendry is liable to a fine between
5,000 ringgit (about 1,163 euros) and 30,000 ringgit or
to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years or to both.
 
The Observatory reiterates its call on the
authorities of Malaysia to put an immediate end to the continuing judicial
harassment of Ms. Lena Hendry, all Pusat KOMAS members as well
as against all human rights defenders in the country, as it is arbitrary and
seems to merely aim at sanctioning their legitimate human rights activities. 
 
Background information:
 
In the evening of July 3, 2013, Pusat KOMAS,
together with the KL & Selangor Chinese
Assembly Hall Civil Right Committee (KLSCAH CRC), organised a private screening of “No Fire
Zone” directed by British Director Callum Macrae. At about 8.30 pm, about 30
minutes after the start of the screening, about 30 officials of the KDN, immigration officials and the police entered the Chinese
Assembly hall and requested to check the film. The organizers negotiated with
them to allow the screening to continue and enter after the screening is over. 
 
However, after the screening, said officials
insisted on checking the identity cards of all participants before they left
the venue. The KDN requested a copy of the film, which was provided by the
organisers in soft copy. They also ordered the organisers - Ms. Anna Har, a member of KOMAS Board of Director, Mr. Arul Prakkash, KOMAS Executive Director, and Ms. Lena
Hendry - to go to the Dang Wangi police station.
The three asked whether they were being arrested, to which the officers replied
no. However, during their interrogation, they were informed that they were
placed under arrest. They were questioned for almost three hours by the investigating team from the KDN.
 
At about 2 am, the three KOMAS
representatives were finally released on police bail after their statement was
recorded. According to the information received, they should find out if they will be charged with any offences in 30 days. Reportedly, they were arrested upon the
basis of Section 6 of the Film Censorship Act. 
 
On July 1, 2013, Ms. Lena Hendry had received
a call from the Censorship Board of the Ministry of Home Affairs, who asked the
organisers to stop the screening because the film had not gone under
censorship. She had replied that the screening was private and upon invitation
only. 
 
Furthermore, there were also strong attempts
by the Sri Lankan Embassy in Malaysia to stop the screening. They faxed a
letter to the KLSCAH asking them not to screen the
documentary. Although they were
invited to the screening they did not show up.
Mr. Tan Jo Hann, a member of the Board of Directors of Pusat KOMAS, was also subjected to
acts of harassment in mid-July 2013[2].
 
Action requested:
 
Please write to the authorities in Malaysia, urging them to:
 
i. Put an end to any act of harassment, including at
the judicial level, against Ms. Lena Hendry as well as against all KOMAS
members and all human rights defenders in Malaysia;
 
ii. Ensure in all circumstances that KOMAS and its
members as well as all human rights defenders in Malaysia are able to carry out
their legitimate activities without any hindrance and fear of reprisals;
 
iii. Conform with the provisions of the UN
Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the
United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially:
- its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the
right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive
for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at
the national and international levels”, as well as
- its Article 12.2, which provides that the State
shall “take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent
authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against
any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination,
pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her
legitimate exercise of his or her rights”; 
 
iv. Ensure in all circumstances respect for human
rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights
standards and international instruments ratified by Malaysia.
