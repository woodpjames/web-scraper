The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of
the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation
Against Torture (OMCT), has received new information and requests your urgent
intervention in the following situation in Turkey. 
New
information:
The
Observatory has been informed by the Human Rights Association (İHD) about the
provisional release of İHD’s Siirt branch Chairperson Mr. Zana Aksu as
well as İHD manager Mr. Azat Taş, and about the ongoing arbitrary detention
of İHD executive
manager Mr. Mirza Ekin.
According
to the information received, on October 3, 2015, the Siirt 1 Peace Court provisionally released
Messrs. Zana Aksu and Mr. Azat Taş pending trial, while Mr. Mirza Ekin was placed in
detention and transferred to the Siirt E Type Closed Prison pending trial. All
three were arrested under the Anti-Terrorism Law (Law 3713 of April 1991) at
the end of September (see background information).
The Observatory welcomes the release of Messrs. Zana Aksu
and Mr. Azat Taş, but strongly deplores the ongoing judicial harassment against
them, as well as the ongoing arbitrary detention of Mr. Mirza Ekin in the
framework of the same case. The Observatory calls upon the Turkish authorities
to immediately release Mr. Mirza Ekin since his detention is arbitrary as it only aims at
sanctioning his human rights activities, and to put an end to any kind of
harassment, including at the judicial level, against the three above-mentioned
human rights defenders.
Background information:
The three human rights defenders were arrested on September
30, 2015 by a police operation
launched against Kurdish political parties and non-governmental organisations
in Siirt province in southeastern Turkey. The operations resulted in the arrest
of at least ten people. During the illegal raid, the police confiscated
books, reports and other documents, as well as computers belonging to İHD. 
This
case is an illustration of a wider trend of repression against human rights
defenders in Turkey. The Observatory recalls in particular that the
Anti-Terrorism Law has been repeatedly used by the authorities as a tool to
harass and imprison human rights defenders.
Actions
requested:
Please
write to the authorities in Turkey, urging them to:
i.
Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Messrs. Zana Aksu, Azat Taş and Mirza Ekin as well as all human rights defenders in Turkey;
ii.
Release Mr. Mirza Ekin immediately and unconditionally,
as well as all other human rights defenders currently in detention, since their
detention is arbitrary as it only aims at curtailing their human rights
activities;
iii.
Put an end to all acts of harassment, including at the judicial level, against Messrs. Zana Aksu, Azat Taş and
Mirza Ekin, as well as other İHD members and all human rights defenders in Turkey;
iv.
Put an end to the crackdown on civil society under the pretext of countering
terrorism and recognise the legitimate role of human rights defenders in line
with Turkey’s international commitments; 

v.
Comply with all the provisions of the United Nations Declaration on Human
Rights Defenders, in particular with:
- its Article 1, which provides that “everyone has the right,
individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the
protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the
national and international levels”;
- its Article 6(a), which foresees that “everyone has the right,
individually and in association with others, to participate in peaceful
activities against violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms”;
- its Article 12.2, which provides that “the State shall take all
necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of
everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence,
threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or
any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise
of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”;
vi.
Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms
in accordance with international human rights standards and international
instruments ratified by Turkey.
