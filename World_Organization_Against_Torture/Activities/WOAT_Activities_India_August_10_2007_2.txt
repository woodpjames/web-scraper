Brief description of the situation The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by a reliable source and by Antenna International, a member the SOS-Torture network, of the fear of extrajudicial killing of Mr. Santosh Mondal (40 years old), resident of Shibpur P.O Border Para P.S Raninagar, District Murshidabad, by personnel of the Border Security Force (BSF) on 27 July 2007 near Shibpur. According to the information received, on 27 July 2007 at around 6:30pm, three BSF personnel attached to the 90 BN BSF ECO Company, Harudanga, started randomly interrogating villagers, namely Mr. Uttam Mondal, Mr. Krishno Mondal, Mr. Tulsi Mondal, Mr. Sunil Mondal and Mr. Santosh Mondal, who were outdoors on the bank of the river Padma. However, the security forces, reportedly not being satisfied with their answers, have allegedly assaulted the villagers with sticks. While four of the villagers managed to escape, Mr. Santosh Mondal was not able to get away so he jumped into the river Padma. The BSF reportedly got back to Harudanga BSF camp, which is according to the information approximately 300 meters away, to take a speed boat in order to catch him. According to the information, when the BSF detected with powerful torches Mr. Santosh Mondal swimming in the water, they reportedly drove near by him. However, instead of taking him out of the water, they then reportedly drove with high speed targeting him. A loud sound was reportedly heard and the propeller of the boat broke down. According to the same information, Mr. Santosh Mondal did not come home that night and his body could not be traced. A relative of Mr. Santosh Mondal, Mr. Suresh Chandra Mondal of Harudanga lodged a complaint before the Officer-in- Charge (O/C) Raninagar P.S. on 29 July 2007. On the same day at around 6:00 pm, Mr. Purna Chandra Ghosh, Sub Inspector of Police attached to Raninagar Police Station, reportedly came to the village for investigation. According to the fact-finding mission, the 90 BN BSF ECO Company, Harudanga, sent a letter to Bangladesh Rifles (BRD) to recover the body of Mr. Santosh Mondal.  The International Secretariat of OMCT expresses its deep concern over the fear of extrajudicial killing of Mr. Santosh Mondal and the beatings suffered by the villagers by BSF personnel. OMCT wishes to recall that according to article 6 1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to which India is a State Party “No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his life”.
