India
November 10, 2017
 
The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a
partnership of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and FIDH, has received
new information and requests your urgent intervention in the following
situation in India.
 
New information:
 
The Observatory has been informed by Banglar
Manabadhikar Suraksha Mancha (MASUM)[1]
about renewed acts of police harassment and intimidation against Mr. Sanjit
Mondal, MASUM District Human Rights Monitor in Murshidabad district, West
Bengal State.
 
According to the information received, on November 8, 2017, at
around 9am, Mr. Sanjit Mondal accompanied a youth from Malipara village to see a medical
practitioner, in order to record evidence of torture to which the youth had
been subjected in custody at Raninagar police station. A medical certificate
documenting the nature of the injuries sustained was required to register a
complaint against the police personnel for torture.
 
At around 2pm on the same day, Mr. Sanjit Mondal saw a police officer
named Mr. Dipak Mondal, from Raninagar police station, loitering around his family’s
shop. Upon seeing Mr. Sanjit Mondal, the police officer walked a few metres
away. When Mr. Sanjit Mondal went to meet him, Mr. Dipak Mondal left
immediately. A few minutes later, a large number of police personnel from
Raninagar police station drove past Mr. Sanjit Mondal’s shop in a white police
vehicle. They parked their vehicle one kilometre away, and walked back near to
Mr. Sanjit Mondal’s shop. During this time, Mr. Sanjit Mondal escaped from his
shop due to fear of being arrested. Upon arrival outside Mr. Sanjit Mondal’s
shop, the police personnel from Raninagar police station gathered at a tea
stall in front of the shop, from which they monitored it for more than three
hours.
 
Witnesses
present at the tea stall subsequently reported having heard Mr. Dipak Mondal
saying that “Sanjit must be taken into
custody tonight as he is trying to make [a] complaint against police personnel
and the Officer in Charge [wants] his arrest”. Witnesses also reported
having heard Mr. Dipak Mondal expressing his concern that “Sanjit could flee to Kolkata to evade his capture”. The comments
related to Mr. Sanjit Mondal’s assistance to the youth from Malipara village
earlier that day. 
 
On
November 9, 2017, Mr. Dipak Mondal monitored Mr. Sanjit Mondal’s shop for the
entire day. At around 2pm, a white police vehicle passed by his shop.
 
At the time of
publication of this Urgent Appeal, Mr. Sanjit Mondal remained in hiding for
fear of being arrested.
 
The Observatory condemns the police harassment and intimidation of
Mr. Sanjit Mondal, which seems to be only aimed at punishing him for
documenting and denouncing allegations of human rights violations committed by
police forces. The Observatory fears that Mr. Sanjit Mondal may be arrested at
any time on fabricated charges.
 
The Observatory recalls that several members of MASUM and Mr. Sanjit Mondal in
particular (see background information) have already faced
reprisals in the past for documenting and denouncing grave human rights
violations allegedly involving members of the police forces and BSF[2].
 
The Observatory calls upon the Indian authorities to put an end to
all acts of harassment, intimidation, and criminalization of Mr. Sanjit Mondal
and all MASUM members, as well as of all human rights defenders in India.
 
Background information:
 
On June 15, 2017, around midnight, police personnel from
Raninagar police station arrived at Mr. Sanjit Mondal’s house, where he lived
with his parents, elder brother, spouse, and children. They surrounded his home
with two police cars and two motorcycles. The police entered the bedroom of Mr.
Sanjit Mondal and his brother, where the latter was sleeping, and asked for Mr.
Sanjit Mondal. However, Mr. Sanjit Mondal had managed to escape the house
before their arrival. At no point did the police explain the reason for their
intrusion nor provide an arrest warrant[3].
 
Actions requested:
 
Please write to the authorities in India, urging them to:
 
i. Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and
psychological integrity of Mr. Sanjit Mondal, all MASUM members, and all human
rights defenders in India;
 
ii. Put an end to any kind of harassment - including at the
judicial level - against Mr. Sanjit Mondal and all the members of MASUM, as
well as against all human rights defenders in India, and ensure that they
are able to carry out their legitimate activities without any hindrance and
fear of reprisals;
 
iii. Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human
Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on
December 9, 1998, especially its Articles 1 and 12.2;
 
iv. Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and
fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards
and international instruments ratified by India.
