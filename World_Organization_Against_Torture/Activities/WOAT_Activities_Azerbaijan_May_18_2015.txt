The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights
Defenders, a joint programme of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT)
and the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), has received new
information and requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in
Azerbaijan.
New
information:
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources
about the extension of the provisional detention of award-winning
investigative journalist Ms. Khadija
Ismayilova. Ms.
Khadija Ismayilova is a well-known independent reporter in Azerbaijan. She
received the Gerd Bucerius Free Press of Eastern Europe Award by Zeit-Stiftung
on May 24, 2012, the Courage of Journalism Award by the Washington-based
International Women’s Media Foundation on October 24, 2012, and the Global
Shining Light Award on October 14, 2013. Since 2010, she has published a series
of articles relating to corruptions cases involving President Ilham Aliyev and
his family. Over the past years, Ms. Ismayilova also took part in several human
rights conferences abroad.
According to the information received, on May 14,
2015, the Nasimi District Court of Baku extended the
pre-trial detention of Ms. Khadija
Ismayilova until August 24, 2015, based on the risk that she might try to
influence witnesses in the case or flee the country if released.
The authorities arrested Ms. Ismayilova on December 5,
2014 on dubious charges of incitement to attempt a suicide and later, on
February 13, 2015, charged her with “tax evasion”, “illegal entrepreneurship”,
and “abuse of authority” (see background information).
The Observatory recalls that the extension of her
pre-trial detention is in line with the ongoing crackdown against Azeri civil
society, human rights defenders and journalists, aiming to silence them and
their human rights work in the run-up to the European Games of Baku[1]. In
particular, in the last months, the provisional detention of other human rights
defenders has also been extended: Ms. Leyla
Yunus[2] will
remain in jail until July 28, 2015 and Mr. Arif
Yunusov until August 5, 2015. Furthermore, recently other prominent human
rights defenders have been sentenced with trumped up charges to several years
of prison: Mr. Rasul Jafarov[3]
to 6.5 years and Mr. Intigam Aliyev[4]
to 7.5 years of jail.
The Observatory expresses its deepest concern for the
clear ongoing repression against human rights defenders and journalists in
Azerbaijan and calls upon the Azeri authorities to immediately and
unconditionally release all human rights defenders and journalists arbitrarily
detained, and to drop all charges against them, since they only aim at
sanctioning their human rights activities.
Background information:
On September 5, 2014, Ms. Ismayilova had been held for
two hours at Baku airport as she was returning from an OSCE meeting organised
in Tbilisi. On October 5, 2014, she was again retained at the airport for
several hours after a trip to Strasbourg, where she had met with officials of
the Council of Europe. In addition, on October 12, 2014 and November 18, 2014,
she was banned twice from leaving the country. 
On December 5, 2014, the head of the presidential administration, Mr.
Ramiz Mekhtiev, made a speech in which he accused, amongst others, Ms.
Ismayilova of propagating “heinous ideas towards Azerbaijan”. 
On December 5, 2014, Ms. Ismayilova was summonsed for
interrogation by the prosecutor’s office on dubious charges of “incitement to
attempt a suicide” on the basis of Article 125 of the Criminal Code and then
placed in provisional detention for two months. The charges relate to an
investigation opened in late October, after her former boyfriend, Mr. Tural
Mustafayev, accused her of driving him to commit suicide. 
On January 27, 2015, the provisional detention of Ms.
Ismayilova was extended for one month and 19 days. On February 13, 2015, new
charges of “large-scale embezzlement” (Article 179.3.2), “illegal business”
(Article 192.2.2), “tax evasion” (Article 213.1) and “abusing official powers”
(Article 308.2) were brought against Ms. Khadija Ismayilova. On March 6, 2015,
her provisional detention was again extended until May 24.
Ms. Ismayilova is also facing other charges since October
3, 2014 following a complaint lodged by a political activist, Mr. Elman
Türkoglu, who accused her of defamation. 
Action requested:
Please write to the authorities in Azerbaijan, urging them to:
i.      Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological
integrity of Ms. Khadija Ismayilova as well as all journalists and human rights
defenders in Azerbaijan;
ii.      Immediately and unconditionally release Ms. Khadija
Ismayilova, as well as all the other
arbitrarily detained journalists and human rights defenders, since their
detentions are arbitrary and only aim at sanctioning their human rights
activities; 
iii.     Put an end to any kind of harassment - including at
the judicial level - against Ms. Khadija Ismayilova, and more generally against
all journalists and human rights defenders in Azerbaijan;
iv.     Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on
Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations
on December 9, 1998, especially:
-       Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right,
individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the
protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the
national and international levels”;
-       Article 5, which underscores the right of every
individual to form, join, and participate in non-governmental organizations;
and
-       Article 12.2, which provides that the State shall
“take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent
authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against
any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination,
pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her
legitimate exercise of his or her rights”; 
v.      Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights
and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights
standards and international instruments ratified by Azerbaijan.
