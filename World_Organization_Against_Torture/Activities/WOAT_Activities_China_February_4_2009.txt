Brief description of the situation: The Observatory has been informed by “Human Rights in China” (HRIC) about the enforced disappearance of Mr. Gao Zhisheng, a human rights lawyer and the Director of the Beijing-based Shengzhi Law Office, which has taken on high-profile human rights cases. According to the information received, Mr. Gao Zhisheng who has been under constant police surveillance, along with his family, since receiving a suspended sentence for “inciting subversion” in 2006, was last heard from on January 19, 2009. Since then, he would reportedly being held incommunicado by security forces at an unknown location and his whereabouts remain unknown. The Observatory expresses its deep concern about Mr. Gao Zhisheng’s enforced disappearance as it seems to merely aim at sanctioning his human rights activities, and fears for his physical and psychological integrity. Indeed, given the harsh treatment he received earlier, he is at immediate risk of severe torture and ill-treatment. The Observatory recalls that the National People’s Congress amended the Chinese Constitution in 2004 to include that “the State respects and safeguards human rights” and that in April 2006, China submitted a document to the UN in order to support its candidacy to the Human Rights Council’s first election[1], in which it affirmed that the amendment to the Constitution was aiming at “defining the position of human rights in the overall national development strategy”. The Observatory further wishes to point out that, as a member of the Human Rights Council, China “shall uphold the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights”[2]. Background information: On September 22, 2007, Mr. Gao Zhisheng was driven away from his home by ten plainclothes State security protection officers. On September 13, 2007, Mr. Gao had written an open letter calling upon US Congressmen to express their concern about China’s human rights’ situation in the lead-up to the 2008 Olympic Games. On September 16, 2007, a group of police from the Security Unit of the Beijing Public Security Bureau (PSB) searched his flat and declared that a “supervision and modification” committee was to be formed in order to closely monitor his activities by requiring that some officials live in his flat for an undefined period. Early November 2007, Mr. Gao was brought back to his flat, in Beijing. He would have been beaten and subjected to ill-treatments while in detention. As a criminal defence lawyer, Mr. Gao has been involved in sensitive cases relative to human rights violations, such as torture of members of the Falun Gong and Christian house church leaders, as well as cases of arbitrary detention of petitioners seeking official accountability for acts of corruption and negligence. Arrested without a warrant on August 15, 2006, Mr. Gao had been sentenced on December 22, 2006 for “inciting the subversion of State power” to three year’s imprisonment, commuted into five years parole and to the privation of his political rights during one year. Following this sentencing, Mr. Gao had been released and placed under house arrest.
