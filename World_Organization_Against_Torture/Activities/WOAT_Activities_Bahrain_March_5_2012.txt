(BCHR/IFEX) - 5 March 2012 - The following is a letter by 50 IFEX 
members and other rights groups calling on the Bahrain authorities to 
release from prison human rights defender Abdulhadi Al-Khawaja, whose 
life is at risk after almost four weeks on hunger strike:

His Majesty the King
Shaikh Hamad bin 'Issa Al Khalifa
Office of His Majesty the King P.O. Box 555 Rifa'a Palace, Manama, Bahrain

5 March 2012

Your Majesty,

We, the undersigned 50 human rights organisations which are members 
of the International Freedom of Expression Exchange (IFEX) and other 
groups, call on the government of Bahrain to immediately and 
unconditionally release from prison well-known human rights defender 
Abdulhadi Al-Khawaja, the founder of the Gulf Centre for Human Rights 
and former president of the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights, a member of
 IFEX. Al-Khawaja is a courageous defender of the people's rights in 
Bahrain and the Middle East and North Africa region who is at huge risk 
of dying in prison, having started a hunger strike on 8 February 2012, 
and now suffering deteriorated health as he enters his fourth week 
without nourishment. In an open letter, Al-Khawaja pledged to stay on 
hunger strike until "freedom or death."

According to his family and his lawyer, Al-Khawaja can no longer sit
 up for very long and spends most of his day lying down. The hospital 
clinic can no longer administer IV fluids as the activist's veins are 
too weak.  His condition is more severe, and similar to someone who has 
been on hunger strike for two months.

After being arrested in April 2011, Al-Khawaja was sentenced to life
 in prison in June 2011, as part of a group trial of 21 activists and 
human rights defenders charged with a range of offences related to their
 role in peaceful demonstrations in Bahrain in February and March. Human
 rights organisations and even the Bahrain Independent Commission of 
Inquiry (BICI) have said the trials did not comply with international 
standards of due process, nor even Bahrain's own criminal code, because 
the 21 men were tried under National Safety Courts. While the BICI 
recommended the transfer of all cases for review under civilian courts, 
this has not been done for the case of the 21 activists.

We believe that the evidence is clear that Al-Khawaja and the other 
activists were sentenced in violation of their rights to freedom of 
expression, assembly and association, contrary to international law and 
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

Therefore, we respectfully demand the immediate release of 
Al-Khawaja, and transfer to Denmark, where he is a dual citizen, to get 
the urgent medical treatment he needs as a result of his lengthy hunger 
strike, in addition to the torture he endured while in detention, as 
documented by the BICI and human rights organisations.

We are deeply concerned about the health of human rights defender 
Abdulhadi Al-Khawaja and urge the Bahraini authorities not to reject 
this humanitarian call.

Signed,
