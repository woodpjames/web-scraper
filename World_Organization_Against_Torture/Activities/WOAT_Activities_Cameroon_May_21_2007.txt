Cameroon, Communication No. 1353/2005, 3 April 2007, the UN Human Rights Committee found Cameroon in breach of its obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, notably the prohibition against torture and ill-treatment and the right to freedom of expression.   The case concerns Mr. Philip Njaru, a Cameroonian journalist who is the recipient of multiple international awards for his human rights reporting including the PEN-NOVIB award in recognition of his “brave efforts to resist censorship” and the Hellman-Hammett Grant which is aimed at supporting victims of political persecution. Mr. Njaru was targeted for various forms of intimidation, harassment and torture by the state authorities in Cameroon following newspaper articles he wrote on the subject of misconduct of the police and other authorities. The Human Rights Committee found that Cameroon had violated the prohibition of torture and ill-treatment (Article 7), the right not to be subjected to arbitrary arrest (Article 9(1)and 9(2)), the right to freedom of expression (Article 19) and the right to a remedy (Article 2(3)). The Committee called on the State to immediately investigate and prosecute those persons responsible for Mr. Njaru’s arrest and ill-treatment, take measures to protect him from further threats and intimidation by the security forces, and grant him full compensation for the harm he suffered.   OMCT represented the complainant in this case and will be monitoring the steps taken by the State party to give effect to the judgment of the Committee within the prescribed 90 days.
