The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a partnership of
the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and FIDH, has received new
information and requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in
Cambodia.
 
New Information:
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources,
including the Cambodian Center for Human Rights (CCHR) and the Cambodian League
for the Promotion and Defense of Human Rights (LICADHO), about the retrial and
renewed sentencing of Ms. Yorm Bopha, a housing and land rights activist
who was pivotal in organising and leading protests against the forced evictions
of residents from the Boeung Kak Lake community in Phnom Penh.
 
According
to the information received, on June 28, 2016, Ms. Yorm
Bopha was found guilty for a second time by the
Court of Appeals in Phnom Penh, during a retrial in
relation to an alleged attack on two motorbike taxi drivers on August 7, 2012.
Ms. Yorm Bopha was given a three-year prison sentence, of which she already
served 14 months and 18 days, with the remainder of her sentence to be
suspended. Despite being given a further two and a half years to investigate
the case, the authorities failed to produce any credible evidence linking Ms.
Yorm Bopha to the alleged attack. 
 
The
Observatory recalls that Ms. Yorm Bopha was arrested in September 2012 and
originally sentenced to three years in prison in December 2012, after being
found guilty of the attack. Following an international campaign for her
release, Ms. Yorm Bopha was released on bail in November 2013 after spending
444 days in prison, and her case sent to the Court of Appeals (see background information).
 
The Observatory condemns Ms. Yorm Bopha’s
renewed conviction on the basis of questionable allegations, and
despite the fact that no credible evidence was presented at her trial. The
Observatory considers that Ms. Yorm Bopha was prosecuted and convicted because
of her legitimate activities as a high-profile land
and housing rights activist, in contradiction with international human
rights standards and Cambodia’s international obligations. The Observatory therefore calls for Ms. Yorm Bopha’s full
acquittal and all charges against her to be cleared.
 
Background information: 
 
Several
families from the Boeung Kak Lake community have been battling forced evictions
since 2007, when the government leased their land to a private Cambodian
company, Shukaku, for development purposes. In May 2012, after 13 members of
the Boeung Kak Lake community (the “Boeung Kak 13”) were arbitrarily arrested,
Ms. Yorm Bopha actively campaigned for their release. She maintained a
high-profile presence at every demonstration, became a media spokesperson for
the campaign, and publicly criticized government officials. Due to this
new-found prominence, Ms. Yorm Bopha was verbally threatened, harassed, and
intimidated.
 
On September
4, 2012, Ms. Yorm Bopha was detained for allegedly ordering her brothers to
assault two motorbike taxi drivers near her home on August 7, 2012. Ms. Bopha
has denied these allegations.
 
On December
27, 2012, Ms. Yorm Bopha was sentenced by the Phnom Penh Municipal Court to
three years in prison for “intentional violence with aggravating
circumstances” under Article 218 of the Criminal Code. Much of the so-called
evidence produced during her trial was based on the testimony of the two
alleged victims - civil parties to the case who sat in the court room the whole
time, who were not required to swear an oath and who stood to gain considerable
compensation pending a guilty verdict. The accounts of the alleged victims were
often convoluted and uncorroborated. The prosecution witnesses, one of whom was
the father of one of the alleged victims, continually changed their stories and
contradicted one another.
 
On June
14, 2013, the Court of Appeals in Phnom Penh upheld the conviction of
Ms. Yorm Bopha on an altered charge of instigation
of violence, but suspended one year of her three-year original sentence
on the grounds that she did not directly commit the act.
 
In
August 2013, the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (WGAD)
declared that the detention of Ms. Yorm Bopha was arbitrary as her deprivation
of liberty resulted from having peacefully exercised her right to freedom of
expression[1].
 
Following
widespread outcry over her conviction, on November 22, 2013, Ms. Yorm Bopha was released from prison following a ruling by the
Supreme Court in Phnom Penh, which ordered her release on bail and sent her
case back to the Court of Appeals for further investigation and a retrial.
Since that date, her retrial has been hanging over her head like a sword of Damocles,
amounting to further harassment.
 
Actions
requested:
 
Please write
to the authorities of Cambodia urging them to:
 
i.
Guarantee, in all circumstances, the physical and psychological integrity of
Ms. Yorm Bopha, as well as of all human rights defenders in Cambodia;
 
ii. Fully acquit
and clear Ms. Yorm Bopha of all charges as her conviction only aims at
sanctioning her human rights activities;
 
iii. Put an
end to acts of harassment - including at the judicial level - against Ms. Yorm
Bopha, as well as against all human rights defenders in Cambodia so that they are able to carry out their
work without hindrance or fear of reprisals;
 
iv. Comply
with all the provisions of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted
by the United Nations General Assembly on December 9, 1998, in particular its
Articles 1, 12.1 and 12.2;
 
v.
Guarantee in all circumstances the respect for human rights and fundamental
freedoms in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other
international and regional human rights instruments signed or ratified by the
Kingdom of Cambodia.
