The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) welcomes the decision of the Nobel Committee, and calls upon the international community to take this opportunity to firmly and consistently call for the release of Mr. Liu Xiaobo. The Observatory considers that the Nobel Committee's decision not only honours Mr. Liu Xiabo, but also all those who peacefully advocate in the People's Republic of China for reforms that promote human rights and democracy.
Liu Xiaobo has been in detention since December 2008 as means to sanction his activities in favour of human rights, democracy and the rule of law in his country. On December 25, 2009, the Beijing No.1 Intermediate People’s Court found him guilty of “inciting subversion of State power” and sentenced him to 11 years of imprisonment and two years’ deprivation of political rights, a sentence confirmed in appeal on February 11, 2010.
“To support the Chinese rights defenders like Liu, we must echo their calls and denounce the harsh repression inflicted upon them”, FIDH President Souhayr Belhassen said today.
“The attribution of the Nobel Peace Prize to Liu Xiaobo is a step in the right direction, and should be backed by strong calls for his release”, added Eric Sottas, OMCT Secretary General.
