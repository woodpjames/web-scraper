New Information  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Sudan Organisation Against Torture (SOAT), a member of the OMCT network, that 88 Riziegat prisoners, including two children, Kabashi Alyan and Gadim Hamdoum, who had been sentenced to death in July 2002, along with three other Riziegat prisoners, were released from Kober prison on 29 December 2004. See below for the list of 88 prisoners mentioned in previous appeals Case SDN 100702, SDN 100702.1, SDN 100702.2.  According to the information received, the prisoners were released following a presentation before the High Court by tribal leaders of the Ma’alia and Riziegat tribes following a tribal reconciliation sponsored by the government of Sudan in October 2004 as part of a local conflict resolution. The High Court subsequently dropped the case.   Brief reminder of the situation  The 88 persons, including two children, who are members of the Rizeigat tribe that were arrested on May 6th, 2002, following a conflict between members of the Rizeigat and Ma’aliya tribes, were sentenced on July 17th, 2002 to death by hanging or death by hanging and crucifixion, following what OMCT considers to be an unfair trial, carried out by the Special Court (Emergency Court) in Darfour Province, Sudan. Two of the 88 persons are 14-year old boys.   Remarks  OMCT welcomes the release of the 88 prisoners but wishes to stress that these prisoners have been in detention for nearly three years, and that, according to information received, the special courts in Darfur which sentenced these persons, did not follow due process. The prisoners were tried and charged largely without their lawyers present. Some prisoners were also were also subjected to ill-treatment and torture.  The International Secretariat of OMCT wishes to thank the individuals and institutions who intervened on behalf of the 88 prisoners.
