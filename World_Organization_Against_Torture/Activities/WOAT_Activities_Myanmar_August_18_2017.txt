The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a
partnership of FIDH and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), has
received new information and requests your urgent intervention in the following
situation in Burma. 
 
New information:
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the ongoing
judicial harassment against two land rights defenders, Messrs. Toe Gyi
and Myo Win, leaders of the Mandalay-based Farmers Network Interest of
Farmers and Labor (FNI-FL), and 11 farmers, including the arbitrary detention
of Mr. Toe Gyi and nine of the farmers.
 
According to
the information received, on
August 10, 2017, the Pyin Oo Lwin Township Court rejected an appeal by Messrs.
Toe Gyi and Myo Win and 11 farmers to overturn the June 1, 2017 decision to
revoke their bail (see background information). Mr. Toe Gyi and nine of the farmers who
attended court proceedings were detained and sent to Mandalay’s Obo Prison. Mr.
Myo Win and two farmers, who did not attend proceedings, were summoned and face
a fine of five million kyat (approx. 3,151 Euros) if they do not appear in
court within 15 days.
 
The Observatory strongly condemns the arbitrary detention of Mr. Toe Gyi
and nine farmers, as well as their ongoing judicial harassment, along with that
against Mr. Myo Win and two other farmers, which only aims at punishing them
for their legitimate human rights activities. The Observatory urges the Burmese
authorities to end all forms of harassment – including at the judicial level –
against all of the above-mentioned defenders, and drop all charges against
them.
 
Background information:
 
On October 23, 2016, Messrs.Toe Gyi, Myo Win and 11 farmers were
arrested for their involvement in a plow protest on October 8, 2016 in Pyinsar
Village, Pyin Oo Lwin Township. The protest was against land confiscation
without compensation in the Mandalay Region, which the military started to
carry in 1998, followed by the selling of large tracts of it to private
companies and business executives with ties to the then ruling military junta
for a coffee plantation project[1].
 
On October 24, 2016, Messrs. Toe Gyi, Myo Win and other 11 farmers were
charged under Articles 114 (abetment), 353 (assault of a public servant), 392
(robbery), 427 (mischief), 447 (trespass), and 506 (intimidation) of the
Criminal Code for their involvement in a plow protest.
 
After spending four months in detention, they were granted bail on 23
February 2017. 
 
On June 1, 2017, Pyin Oo Lwin Township Court revoked their bail and
issued arrest warrants.
 
Actions requested:
 
Please write to the authorities of Burma asking them to:
 
Immediately
     and unconditionally release Mr. Toe Gyi and the nine farmers, as their
     detention is arbitrary;
 
Immediately
     and unconditionally put an end to all acts of judicial harassment -
     including at the judicial level –, and drop all the charges brought against
     Messrs. Toe Gyi and Myo Win,
     the 11 farmers, and all other human rights defenders in
     Burma;
 
Guarantee in all circumstances the
     physical and psychological integrity of Messrs. Toe Gyi and Myo Win, the 11 farmers,
     and all other human
     rights defenders in Burma;
 
Comply
     with all the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders,
     adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on December 9, 1998, in
     particular with its Articles 1 and 12.2;
 
Ensure
     in all circumstances respect
     for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards.
