New information: The Observatory has been informed by the Cambodian Human Rights Action Committee (CHRAC) and by the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) about the Court of Appeal’s decision, on April 12, 2007, to uphold the Phnom Penh Municipal Courts verdict in the case of Messrs. Born Samnang and Sok Sam Oeun, who were convicted of murdering Mr. Chea Vichea, president of the Free Trade Union of the Workers of the Kingdom of Cambodia (FTUWKC); they had been sentenced to 20 years in prison and ordered to pay U$5000 each in compensation. According to the information received, the Appeals Court decision comes in spite of overwhelming evidence of the innocence of the two men, including testimony by a key eye-witness and by the senior police officer initially investigating the crime that the two did not commit the murder, and the fact that both had credible alibis for the time of the killing. The verdict further ignored many irregularities by the police and municipal court in this case, including the falsification of evidence and the use of threats, physical force and bribery by the police to obtain a confession from one of the accused. In addition, the Court of Appeal refused to take into account other exculpatory testimonies as well as a written statement and a video-tape of testimony from Mrs. Va Sothy, the main eyewitness to Mr. Chea Vichea’s murder, who stated that Messrs. Born Samnang and Sok Sam Oeun were not the killers. Furthermore, during the trial the prosecutor acknowledged that there were gaps in the investigation of the case and requested to further investigation. Both men remain detained at the Prey Sar prison. The Observatory condemns the instrumentalisation of the judiciary which seems to aim at shielding the real perpetrators of Mr. Chea Vichea’s murder. The Observatory is also concerned at the lack of effective action by the authorities following the murder of another trade unionist, Mr. Hy Vuthy, in February this year. Background information: Mr. Chea Vichea was shot dead on January 22, 2004. In a trial marred with irregularities, Mr. Sok and Mr. Born were found guilty of murder on August 1, 2005 and were sentenced by the Phnom Penh Municipal Court to 20 years’ imprisonment and a fine of 3,800 dollars in compensation and interests. Mr. Chea Mony, the brother of the victim and president of FTUWKC, stated that he would refuse the money because he had his doubts as to whether the two men were guilty. On October 21, 2005, Mr. Sok and Mr. Born filed an appeal after having asked for an amnesty from King Norodom Sihamon. On July 25, 2006, the secretary of the Ministry of Justice wrote to Mr. Chea Mony that more evidence would be required to reopen the investigation. In this respect, on August 10, 2006, Ms. Var Sothy, owner of the newspaper stand in front of which Mr. Chea Vichea was murdered, gave a detailed witness statement stating the innocence of the two men and describing the murder, the murderer and his accomplice, their car, etc. The statement was given from abroad, as she left the country, fearing for her life. In August 2006, the police officer in charge of the arrest of the two men, Mr. Heng Pov, former superintendent of Phnom Penh, admitted in an interview with the French newspaper L’Express that he had believed that the men were innocent as soon as the investigation had begun. He has since fled Cambodia, after having accused the Prime Minister and other high-level representatives of the authorities of being involved in many human rights abuses, including murders, kidnappings and drug trafficking. The hearing in the appeal lodged by Mr. Sok and Mr. Born’s lawyers was first scheduled for October 6, 2006. However, it was postponed due to the absence of the president of the Court. Action requested: Please write to the Cambodian authorities and ask them to:  Guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of Messrs. Born Samnang and Sok Sam Oeun, as well as of all human rights defenders working in Cambodia, in all circumstances; Release Messrs.
