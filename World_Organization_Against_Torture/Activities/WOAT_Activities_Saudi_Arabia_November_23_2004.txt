New information:  The Observatory has been informed by a reliable source of the arrest and detention of Mr. Abd El-Rahman Allahim, a Saudi Arabian lawyer, on November 6, 2004.   Mr. Allahim is the spokesperson for the defence team of three Saudi Arabian human rights defenders, Mr. Abdulla Al-Hamed, Mr. Matrouk Al-Faleh and Mr. Ali Al-Domainy, who had been arrested on March 17, 2004, after asking for secular reforms in Saudi Arabia.  Mr. Abd El-Rahman Allahim was arrested after disclosing to the French Press Agency, AFP, the letter addressed by his three clients to Prince Abdullah Al-Saud, concerning the arbitrariness of their detention.   Mr. Allahim had already been arrested on March 15, 2004, with Mr. Abdullah al-Hamed, Matrouk Al-Faleh and Mr. Ali Al-Domainy, along with eight other human rights activists, released since then. He himself was released, on March 17, 2004.  Mr. Allahim is currently detained at Riyadh Central prison, together with his clients. No charges have been filed against any of them.  The Observatory is extremely concerned for the physical integrity of Mr. Allahim and of his co-detainees and considers their detention to be arbitrary since no charges have been brought against them and since their arrest aims at sanctioning their freedom of expression.    Background information:  On March 15, 2004, twelve individuals, among whom Saudi political activists and human rights defenders, including Mr. Allahim, were arrested because of their human rights work and efforts toward political secular reforms in Saudi Arabia; they were held in incommunicado detention at the General Intelligence Department in “Ulayasha” prison or Riyadh Central Prison, in Riyadh.  They were allegedly arrested  for: (1) criticizing the lack of independence of the National Commission on Human Rights; (2) submitting an application to form an independent human rights organisation to promote and protect human rights in Saudi Arabia; and (3) actively engaging in peaceful activities towards political reforms, democracy and respect of human rights, including the signing of the “Constitutional Kingdom” statement addressed to the Crown Prince Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz al-Saud, in December 2003.  During the period which goes from 17 to 29 March 2004, nine of them were released, including Mr. Allahim.  Reportedly, authorities released these individuals after forcing them to sign a pledge in which they agreed to end their participation in any political or human rights activities and to stop calling for reforms. Mr. Abdulla Al-Hamad, Mr. Matrouk Al-Faleh and Mr. Ali Al-Domainy remained in incommunicado detention because of their refusal to sign the pledge.   Action requested: Please write to the authorities of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia urging them to:  i. guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of Messrs. Abd El-Rahman Allahim, Abdulla Al-Hamad, Matrouk Al-Faleh and Ali Al-Domainy;  ii. order their immediate and unconditional release, in the absence of any valid charges against them;  iii. ensure the right to form independent human rights organisations to promote and protect human rights in Saudi Arabia;  iv. conform to the provisions of the Declaration on Humans Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, in particular article 1, which states that "everyone has the right, individually or in association with others, to promote the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels";  v. ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards.
