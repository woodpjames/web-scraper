The deteriorating human rights and humanitarian
situation in Myanmar warrants a strong and unified response from the European
Union (EU) and its member states at several crucial opportunities in the coming
weeks. 
Since October 2016, more than 750,000 Rohingya
women, men and children have fled from Myanmar to Bangladesh as a result of
unjustified and grossly disproportionate attacks by security forces in northern
Rakhine State. Security forces are believed to have killed thousands of
Rohingya[1], have raped
Rohingya women and girls and burned their villages to the ground in a
devastating campaign of ethnic cleansing that amounts to crimes against
humanity. The violations and crimes continue to this day, as Myanmar security
forces starve, abduct and rob Rohingya in an attempt to force even more of them
to flee the country. 
Meanwhile, in Kachin and Shan States, fighting
between the Myanmar military and ethnic armed groups has intensified in recent
weeks, with reports of civilian casualties and further displacement. Across
Myanmar, there has also been a worrying erosion of the space for freedom of
expression, and journalists and other media workers have faced arrest and
prosecution for their work. 
Our organisations strongly urge the EU and its
member states to respond in a way that is proportionate to the massive scale
and serious nature of the violations being committed, and send an unequivocal
message to the Myanmar authorities – both civilian and military – that ongoing
violations and impunity will not be tolerated. 
The EU must also continue to express its full
support to United Nations (UN) Special Procedures – in particular the UN
Special Rapporteur for Myanmar and the UN Fact-Finding Mission (FFM). Since
March 2017, the Myanmar government has refused to cooperate with, or allow
access to, the FFM – the only viable body currently working towards accountability
for violations in Myanmar – and has also publicly declared its intention to
stop cooperating with the Special Rapporteur, who has been barred from
accessing the country. 
At the same time, the EU and its member states
must act to ensure that any return of Myanmar refugees from Bangladesh are
safe, voluntary, and dignified as required under international law – and not
coerced, which would amount to refoulement. This rules out any
state-organised, massive and time-constrained returns such as those envisaged
in the agreements reached between Myanmar and Bangladesh last year. The EU’s
endorsement of this plan – despite serious concerns by UN agencies and others –
was both irresponsible and premature. 
At the Foreign Affairs Council (FAC) meets on 25
February, we urge the EU and its member states to issue strong Conclusions
that: 
Condemn, in the strongest possible terms, the serious violations
     and abuses committed in Rakhine State, and explicitly
     acknowledge the commission of crimes against humanity by the Myanmar
     security forces  
·      
Condemn, and call for the
dismantling of, the state-sponsored system of segregation and discrimination
against the Rohingya in Rakhine State  
Address specifically the violations of international humanitarian
     and human rights law committed in Kachin and Shan States, including
     extrajudicial executions, torture, forced labour, and indiscriminate
     shelling which has killed civilians  Extend the existing EU arms embargo against Myanmar, ensuring that
     it applies to all forms of military assistance, including the provision of
     military or Border Guard Police (BGP) training and other military
     assistance  Impose targeted financial sanctions on senior military officials
     responsible for international crimes  Use all instruments available to engage with the Myanmar
     authorities on the HR situation including  through the Everything but Arms
     (EBA) scheme  Commit to exercise universal jurisdiction in investigating and
     prosecuting or extraditing for prosecution  any person under their
     jurisdiction who may reasonably be suspected of committing crimes against
      humanity or other crimes under international law in Myanmar  Reiterate that any return of Rohingya refugees to Myanmar should be
     safe, voluntary and dignified; be  developed in dialogue with the
     refugees, in partnership with, and under the supervision of, the UN High
     Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and OHCHR; and be fully respectful of
     international law, including the principle of non-refoulement  Ensure that any international aid (including development and
     financial assistance) in Rakhine State are explicitly and specifically
     conditioned on non-discrimination, non-segregation and equality and that
     measures are in place to ensure this is condition respected in practice.
     In particular, any ongoing or planned police or security assistance to
     Myanmar must be fully human rights compliant  Express concern about the failure to respect the right to freedom
     of expression, including the recent arrest and detention of journalists,
     and call for the immediate and unconditional release of all prisoners of
     conscience in the country  Call on the Myanmar government to: Immediately
      cease all human rights violations, including those constituting crimes
      against humanity  and
      war crimes, in Rakhine, Kachin and Shan States as well as other parts of
      the country  Allow full,
      unfettered access to the UN-Mandated FFM to carry out its mandate of
      conducting  investigations
      into human rights violations and abuses in Myanmar  Ensure that
      prompt, impartial, independent and effective investigations are carried
      out into all  credible
      allegations of violations and abuses of international human rights law
      and crimes under  international law  Immediately allow full and
      unfettered access to all parts of the country for humanitarian
      organisations Take immediate
      action to address the long-standing and systematic discrimination and
      segregation of  the
      Rohingya and other Muslims in Myanmar, including by: ensuring equal
      access to citizenship on a  non-discriminatory
      basis; removing arbitrary and discriminatory restrictions on freedom of
      movement and freedom of religion; ensuring access to healthcare, education
      and other services Condemn unequivocally all
      advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes
      incitement  to
      discrimination, hostility or violence, and take effective measures to
      tackle and counter it  Immediately and
      unconditionally release all individuals deprived of liberty solely for
      the peaceful  exercise of
      their human rights  Amend or repeal all laws
      which arbitrarily restrict the rights to freedom of expression,
      association,  and peaceful
      assembly to bring them in to line with international human rights law and
      standards  End all pending criminal
      proceedings against peaceful activists, journalists, and human rights
      defenders and ensuring their freedom to pursue their activities without
      hindrance or fear of reprisals  Fully cooperate with the UN
      Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, the  Office of the High Commissioner for
      Human Rights (OHCHR).  
 
In addition,
we urge the EU and its member states to put forward a strong, robust and
comprehensive resolution on Myanmar at the 37th session of the UN Human Rights
Council, which is fully reflective of the situation on the ground and
incorporates the above recommendations. The EU and member states should
likewise act to renew the mandate of the Special Rapporteur under Item 4.  
Finally, the
EU must ensure that any human rights dialogue with Myanmar is used to push for
concrete and meaningful progress on human rights, and not simply conducted
“business as usual” given the scope and scale of the human rights violations in
Myanmar. For the upcoming human rights dialogue to be meaningful, the EU must
raise the concerns above in the strongest possible terms, and make clear the
requirement for progress. In order to ensure a robust and meaningful dialogue,
the EU should set clear benchmarks for its engagement in the process. It should
further commit to transparency and accountability by publishing a written
statement after the dialogue, setting on record the issues raised and recommendations
made by the EU delegation, in addition to details of any responses or concrete
commitments made by the Myanmar authorities.

Frontières (MSF) in refugee settlement camps in Bangladesh estimate that at
least 9,000 Rohingya died in Rakhine State between 25 August and 24 September.
As 71.7% of the reported deaths were caused by violence, at least 6,700
Rohingya, in MSF’s most conservative estimations, have been killed, including
at least 730 children below the age of five years. http://www.msf.org/en/article/myanmarbangladesh-msf-surveys-estimate-least-6700-rohingya-were-killed-during-attacks
