They demand that the Right to Food be declared a national priority. Moreover, they urge to cease violence and threats against social, community, indigenous, peasant and trade union leaders, and to effectively protect human rights defenders.
The mission report on the Right to Food in Guatemala was handed over on March 8 in Geneva to the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food, Olivier De Schutter, and will be presented in Guatemala on March 9, on the occasion of a forum jointly convened by the Guatemalan Presidential Human Rights Commission (COPREDEH). Among the main recommendations to the State of Guatemala presented in the report are the following: 


To declare the promotion and protection of the      right to food a national priority, ensuring its effective and coherent      implementation in all the State's policies and actions which might have an      impact on the food situation at the levels of homes, communities, cities,      departments or nation; 


To adopt a moratorium on forced evictions as long      as legislation and administrative procedures are not coherent with      international human rights law with regards to the right to food and      housing, and to produce, in coordination with international human rights      bodies and civil society, legal and administrative directives for the      protection of human rights in the context of agrarian conflicts; 


To stop the expansion of agrofuel production,      giving priority to the sustainable production of food and to the      superseding of the food crisis by promoting peasant and indigenous      agriculture and economy; 


To revise the Mining Law to guarantee the full      recognition of ILO Convention 169 and the results of community      consultations, also prohibiting the use of cyanide in mining, guaranteeing      the right to food and to water, preventing desertification and environment      deterioration, and guaranteeing a fair distribution of profits; 


Given the fact that there is an historic debt to      women, to ensure that all public policies and programmes effectively      incorporate the gender aspect and the equal rights of women, with an      emphasis on peasant and indigenous women as well as on mothers in situation      of social vulnerability; 


To ensure that public policies and social      programmes initiated by the Government are more equitable and democratic,      and are in conformity with human rights principles of participation,      transparency, non discrimination and accountability, preventing their      instrumentalisation for political objectives;


To take all necessary      measures to guarantee the effective protection of human rights      defenders, and institutionalise the Instancia      de Análisis de Ataques contra Defensores de Derechos Humanos;


To put an end and prevent any initiative that might lead to the criminalisation of human rights defenders and activists of the peasant, indigenous and trade union movements;




To effectively and promptly investigate human      rights violations, with the aim of ending impunity, including in      situations where interference in political and economic interests exist.


The mission report was elaborated by a large coalition of international organisations: FoodFirst Information and Action Network (FIAN), the international peasant movement La Via Campesina, the European network Copenhagen Initiative for Central America and Mexico (CIFCA), the Coalition of Catholic Agencies for Development (CIDSE), the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), including the Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders (FIDH-OMCT), and the Association of World Council of Churches related Development Organisations in Europe (APRODEV).
