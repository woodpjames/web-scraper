Arrest/Arbitrary detention

The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in The Philippines.
 
 
Description of the situation:
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources of the harassment, arbitrary arrest and detention of Mr. Christopher Solano, Mr. Althea Villagonzalo, Mr. Whelgester Paglinawan, Mr. Manuel Bentillo, volunteers of the human rights organisation Alliance for the Advancement of People’s rights (KARAPATAN) – Central Visayas and members of the Human Rights Monitoring Team in Sta. Catalina, Negros Oriental.
According to the information received, the four volunteers were in Sta. Catalina since February 14, 2011, documenting human rights violations in the militarised communities of the municipality.
On March 17, 2011 the four human rights defenders went to the village of Barangay Nagbinlod, municipality of Sta. Catalina in Negros Oriental, to document reported human rights abuses against villagers by State security forces, following an alleged clash between the military and the New People's Army (NPA). Local farmers reported to the volunteers that Mr. Marvin Villegas, 18 years old, a village resident, was shot by members of the 1st Scout Rangers Battalion of the Army while he was taking the family’s cattle to the fields. 
While Mssrs. Solano, Villagonzalo, Paglinawan, Bentillo and eleven farmers were reportedly assisting Mr. Villegas to get medical help, members of the Alpha Company of the 79th Infantry Brigade of the Philippines Army (IBPA) arrested them all. They were held in custody by the soldiers along the village road side of Bgy. Nagbinlod, and questioned by the military.  Nine of the local farmers were reportedly later released, while the rest of the group was brought to the Sta. Catalina Municipal Police Station. While in detention, Mssrs. Solano, Villagonzalo, Paglinawan, Bentillo and Mr. Villegas were accused by soldiers of being members of the NPA. 
The soldiers later took Mr. Villegas and his mother away to Dumaguete City. 
As of the issuing of this urgent appeal, no charges have been filed against the human rights defenders and the villagers still detained in the station of the Philippines National Police. Members of Karapatan have been able to visit them. 
 
The Observatory strongly condemns the arbitrary arrest and detention of the Mssrs. Solano, Villagonzalo, Paglinawan, Bentillo and the villagers and urges the Philippines authorities to immediately release them and order a thorough, impartial and transparent investigation into their arrest and detention, in order to identify all those responsible, bring them before a civil competent and impartial tribunal and apply to them the penal sanctions provided by the law.
