Ali Al-Domainy, Abdullah Al-Hamad and Matrouk Al-FalehURGENT APPEAL - THE OBSERVATORY  New information SAU 001 / 0304 / OBS 017.3 Arbitrary detentions / Sentencing Saudi Arabia  May 20, 2005   The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in Saudi Arabia.   New information:  The Observatory has been informed by the Egyptian Organisation for Human Rights (EOHR) that Messrs. Ali Al-Domainy, Abdullah Al-Hamad and Matrouk Al-Faleh, three Saoudian human rights activists, were sentenced on May 15, 2005 respectively to nine, seven and six years of imprisonment by the Riyadh Criminal Court.  According to the information received, the hearing was hold behind closed door on the pretext of the necessity of maintaining public order. Only two of their family members were allowed to attend the hearing.  In 2004, Mssrs. Ali Al-Domainy, Abdullah Al-Hamad and Matrouk Al-Faleh had been charged for offending and destabilising the State, opposing the judiciary and disseminating false information.  The Observatory recalls that their defence lawyer, Mr. Abd Al-Rahman Allahim, who was arrested in November 2004, remains in detention in al-Ha’ir prison. He was allegedly charged in January 2005 for violating a pledge that he signed ensuring that he had stop the campaign in favour of political reforms and human rights (See background information).   The Observatory considers their detention as arbitrary since it aims at sanctioning their freedom of expression and association. In particular, their detention contradicts article 6 of the UN Declaration on Humans Rights Defenders, which states that “everyone has the right, individually or in association with others, to study, discuss, form and hold opinions on the observance, both in law and in practice of all human rights and fundamental freedoms and, through these and other appropriate means, to draw public attention to those matters”.   Background information:  On March 9, 2004, the Saudi authorities officially reiterated the announcement of the establishment of the National Human Rights Committee (first publicised in May 2003), and that it would be chaired by a president to be appointed by the government. Messrs. Ali Al-Domainy, Abdullah Al-Hamad, Matrouk Al-Faleh, and Abd El-Rahman Allahim together with eight other persons, known for their active involvement in human rights advocacy and the promotion of democratic reform, sharply criticised the lack of independence of this Committee. Short after, they submitted a request for the creation and registration of an independent human rights organisation (see Observatory Annual Report 2004).  On March 15 and 17, 2004, these twelve persons were arrested by Saudi intelligence officers and held in solitary confinement in the Ulayasha prison, in Riyadh. Nine of them were released in the following days after having been forced to sign a pledge that they would cease their campaign in favour of political reforms and human rights. Messrs. Al-Hamad, Al-Faleh and Al-Domayni, who refused to sign the document, remained in custody without access to their lawyers.  On November 6, 2004, Mr. Abd El-Rahman Allahim was again arrested after disclosing to the Agence France Presse (AFP), the letter addressed by his three clients to Prince Abdullah Al-Saud, concerning the arbitrariness of their detention.  The request submitted by the twelve activists to register an independent human rights association was neither acknowledged nor processed.   Action requested: Please write to the authorities of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia urging them to: i. Guarantee, in all circumstances, the psychological and physical integrity of Messrs. Abdullah Al-Hamad, Matrouk Al-Falehj, Ali Al-Domainy and Abd Al-Rahman Allahim;  ii. Order the immediate and unconditional release of Messrs. Abdullah Al-Hamad, Matrouk Al-Falehj, Ali Al-Domainy and Abd Al-Rahman Allahim, since their detention is arbitrary;  iii. Ensure the right to form independent human rights organisations to promote and protect human rights in Saudi Arabia;  iv. Conform to the provisions of the Declaration on Humans Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, in particular article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually or in association with others, to promote the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels” and article 6.b above-mentioned;  v. Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards ratified by Saudi Arabia.
