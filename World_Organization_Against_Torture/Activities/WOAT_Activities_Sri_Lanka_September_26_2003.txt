Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Asian Human Rights Commission (AHRC), a member of the OMCT network, that police officers of the Saliyawewa Police Station and a prominent local politician have threatened to burn down the home of Dawundage Pushpakumara, a 14-year-old torture victim, if his family pursued their complaints on this matter. The victim’s family is extremely poor and will face deprivation and severe loss if their home is burnt down.  It has also been reported that police officials impeded Pushpakumara’s access to medical treatment as they were afraid that the medical record of the victim’s injuries could be used against them in a legal proceeding. According to the information received, the victim is currently in hiding and is being taken care of by a human rights organisation. The officer in charge of the police station, who was reported to be amongst those who tortured Pushpakumara, continues to occupy the same post.  OMCT is gravely concerned about the threats and efforts to intimidate Pushpakumara’s family and for their safety and strongly condemns the continuing impunity of the police officers. The OMCT calls upon the Sri Lankan authorities to take immediate action to ensure the security and physical and psychological integrity of the victim and his family, to order a thorough and impartial investigation against those involved in the alleged torture of Pushpakumara and intimidation of his family, and award appropriate reparation to the victim and his family.  Brief Reminder of the Situation  According to the information received, at around 10:30pm on 1st  September 2003, about six police officers from the Saliyawewa Police Post in Putlam, dressed in civilian clothes, came to Pushpakumara's sister's house and threatened to shoot their cousin if Pushpakumara did not go with them. They grabbed his neck and pushed him into their van, where Pushpakumara saw four bottles of liquor. According to Nisantha (Pushpakumara's cousin), police officers went to Puspakumara's house after having drunk liquor and threatened to shoot Nisantha if he did not show them Pushpakumara's house.   Inside the van several police officers assaulted Pushpakumara, telling him to confess to stealing a chain. They took him to Saliyawewa Police Post and threw him into a cell. Then they tied his hands behind him and hung him on a beam, where the Officer in Charge (OIC) and several others assaulted him. Then they put him in a room full of ants with his hands still tied.   When his parents went to police station to see their son, they saw Pushpakumara hanging on a beam with his hands tied behind him with a fiber cord. His mother asked to see him, but a police officer told her that the OIC was not in the police post and to come the next day. Meanwhile, about ten to fifteen persons claiming to be the owners of the chain came to the police station and threatened to get the police to harm her son if he did not return the chain. The police officers did not react to any of the threats.   The next morning (2nd September), his mother and sister were allowed to speak to Pushpakumara and he showed them his hands (which had deep wounds), legs (ant bites), head and chest as places where they assaulted him. He added, "It is good that you came last night, otherwise I would have been killed." The OIC asked Pushpakumara whether he took the chain and he said no. Then the OIC allowed him to go home with the mother. After Pushpakumara went back home, he complained of headaches and fainted. The next morning the General Hospital of Putlam admitted him.    On 5th September the police officers told the mother and sister that Pushpakumara was not a thief and the real culprit had been arrested. The police officer told them to remove Pushpakumara from the hospital and asked the supposed owner of the chain to give one thousand rupees to the mother. Two police officers and the owner of the chain took the mother and sister to the General Hospital, Putlam at about 7-8pm, but Pushpakumara had been forced to leave the hospital.    Pushpakumara fell very ill at home and the next day a person told him the thief was going to be released and that he would be arrested, so he should go back to the hospital. However, due to police pressure the hospital would not admit him. Attempts to get help from the child welfare office also failed for their fear of the police. A human rights organization reached the family and tried to take the child to a hospital outside the area. Meanwhile, the Child Rights Authority, which was informed of the situation took Pushpakumara to a hospital in Colombo where he was treated. Now the family is under severe pressure from the police to stop pursuing complaints against the police officials.   Action requested  Please write to the authorities in Sri Lanka urging them to:  1.	Guarantee the integrity and security of Pushpakumara, his family and their home 2.	order an impartial investigation into the circumstances of the arrest; the alleged acts of torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment; intimidation and threats against the victim’s family in order to identify those responsible and bring them before a competent tribunal; 3.	apply the penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions provided by law against the policemen involved; 4.	guarantee psychosocial support and further medial assistance to Pushpakumara and obtain compensations for him and his family; 5.	put an immediate end to all forms of torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment of children in accordance with national and international legislation and particularly with articles 37 and 40 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.
