This is one of the main activities of OMCT and is complementary to its direct assistance to victims. These alternative reports are a valuable source of information for Independent Experts who monitor the implementation of United Nations human rights treaties. With these reports, it is possible to evaluate the situation as objectively as possible and to take a critical look at government action aimed at implementing human rights standards. Recent OMCT's alternative reports and other relevant information submitted to United Nations treaty bodies include:   Human Rights Committee (HRC)   86th session March 2006:  Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)-  Human Rights Situation in the DRC (in French)   87th session July 2006:  Accountof the 87th session     88th session October 2006:  Honduras - report in preparation  89th session March 2007:  Rwanda - report in preparation   Committee AgainstTorture - CAT  36th session May 2006:  Georgia - Human Rights Violations in Georgia  Guatemala - Human Rights Violations in Guatemala (in Spanish)  Togo - Human Rights Violations in Togo (in French)   37th session November 2006:  Tajikistan - report in preparation  Burundi - report in preparation    Committe on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women - CEDAW  36th session August 2006:  Georgia - Violence against Women in Georgia   Mexico - Violence against Women in detention in Mexico   Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)- Violence against Women in the DRC    Committeeon the Rights of the Child  - CRC  42nd session May 2006:  Uzbekistan - Children'srights in Uzbekistan   43rd session September 2006:  Benin - Children'srights in Benin (in French)   44th session January 2007:  Kenya - report in preparation   Chile - report in preparation       Press releases and articles:    USA:    United States: The UN Human Rights Committee criticises the US human rights'record    Georgia:    Analternative report by OMCT reveals that Georgia's policy to fight against crime leads to unacceptable abuse and torture   Guatemala:    Torture in Guatemala: an alternative NGO report presented to the United Nations   Mexico:    State violence against women in detention in Mexico Lawsin Mexico encourage impunity of autors of violence (in Spanish)    Uzbekistan:    Domestic violence and deprivation of liberty of children in Uzbekistan: the Committee on the Rights of the Child confirms OMCT’s concerns as denounced in its alternative report    Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC): The Democratic Republic of the Congo before the UN: "Human rights shouldnot be put between parentheses during the electoral process" (in French)     Libération Afrique - Impunity of perpetrators of acts of torutre (in French)      The World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) is the world’s largest coalition of non-governmental organisations fighting against arbitrary detention, torture, summary and extrajudicial executions, forced disappearances and other forms of violence.
