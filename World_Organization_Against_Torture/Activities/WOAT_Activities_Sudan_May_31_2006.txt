Brief description of the situation:The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Sudan Organisation Against Torture (SOAT), a member of OMCT network, about the arrests, arbitrary detentions, ill-treatments and extrajudicial killing of internally displaced people (IDPs) following demonstrations in Darfur against the recently signed Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA), which has yet to be signed by all parties to the conflict.  According to the information received, on 29 May 2006, security forces and central reserve police officers opened live ammunition on a demonstrating crowd inside Otash IDP camp killing Mr. Ali Musa Issa. The IDPs were protesting against the Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA) between the government of Sudan and a faction of the Sudan Liberation Army. The officers beat the IDPs and arrested three members of the Fur tribe, namely Mr. Abdella Ahmed Abdella (30 yrs), Mr. Ibrahim Abdella Sideeg (32 yrs), and Mr. Ahmed Mohamed Adam (48 yrs).  In a separate incident, on 29 May 2006, the security forces and police officers in Nyala, Southern Darfur, arrested tens of IDPs, including women, from Kalma IDP camp. The IDPs were arrested after holding a demonstration against the DPA. During the demonstration, the IDPs attempted to present a memorandum to the United Nations (UN) office in Nyala highlighting their concerns. On their way to the UN offices, security officers attacked the demonstrators. The officers beat the demonstrators with sticks and arrested scores of several of the demonstrators. Twenty-one of  the detainees were taken to Nyala Wasat police station, where they were charged with offences under articles 50 (undermining the constitutional system) and 51 (waging war against the State). An unknown number of demonstrators remain in security custody and are facing no charges. The details of the persons in Nyala Wasat police station are as follows:   1.	Mr. Ibrahim Sidig Ali 2.	Mrs. Halima Adam Ibrahim 3.	Mr. Yagoub Ismaeal Mohamed 4.	Mr. Ismaeal Adam Ismaeal 5.	Mr. Abdel Mounim Mohamed Khamees 6.	Mrs. Fatima Adam Issa 7.	Mrs. Hawa Shogar Ibrahim 8.	Mrs. Zahra Abdella Ahmed 9.	Mrs. Halima Musa Ateam 10.	Mrs. Hawa Khamees Mohamed 11.	Mrs. Fatima Ishag Idrees 12.	Mrs. Halima Abdel Shafi Haroun 13.	Mrs. Hawa Adam Ali 14.	Mr. Abdel Majeed Ahmed Ishag 15.	Mr. Telfi Hassan Karam 16.	Mr. Ahmed Joumma Salih 17.	Mr. Ali Abdel Rahman Abdel Mawala 18.	Mr. Hamid Issa Haroun 19.	Mr. Hussain Abaker Osher 20.	Mr. Alsayid Soulieman Musa 21.	Mrs. Kaltoum Abel Kareem Abdella The International Secretariat of the OMCT expresses its deep concern over these events. In particular, OMCT is gravely concerned for the physical and psychological integrity of the above-mentioned detainees and calls for an immediate and impartial investigation into their arbitrary detention.   Furthermore, OMCT strongly condemns the excessive use of force by the government security forces and calls on the government to acknowledge the major causes of this demonstration and to respond accordingly through raising awareness of the provisions contained in the DPA. The DPA includes many positive elements which once communicated to the wider public in the region will ensure a stable and secure environment for all Darfurians. Most importantly, it acknowledges the harm caused to the people of Darfur, in particular women and children, as a result of the conflict and notes that the first step for implementing the DPA is in addressing the “needs of the war affected areas, with special attention to displaced and war-affected persons” (article 108). In addressing these needs, the peace agreement creates the framework for several new institutions and restructuring of existing institutions to ensure a representative government as well as the provision of adequate compensation for the civilian population.   The International Secretariat of the OMCT further calls on the Sudanese authorities to respect the rights to  freedoms of peaceful assembly and association, as guaranteed by international human rights law, in particular Article 20 of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, and Articles 21 and 22 of the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In addition, the UN Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials provides in its Article 2 that “in the performance of their duty, law enforcement officials shall respect and protect human dignity and maintain and uphold the human rights of all persons”. Requested Actions:Please write to the authorities in Sudan urging them to:  1.	Guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of all the above-mentioned detainees; 2.	Ensure the immediate release of all persons arrested in the absence of valid legal charges, and if such charges exist, ensure that they are given a prompt and fair trial, in which their procedural rights are guaranteed at all time; 3.	Order a thorough and impartial investigation into these events and in particular into the death of Mr. Ali Musa Issa, in order to identify all those responsible, bring them to trial and apply the penal and/or administrative sanctions as provided by law; 4.	Guarantee that adequate compensation is awarded to the family of Mr. Ali Musa Issa; 5.	Guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
