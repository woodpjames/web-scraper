Ill-treatment/ Death threats/ Lack of an effective investigation

The International Secretariat of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) requests your URGENT intervention in the following situation in India/ West Bengal.
Brief description of the situation
The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by Banglar Manabadhikar Suraksha Mancha (MASUM), a member of OMCT SOS-Torture Network, about the ill-treatment and death threats that Mr. Birendra Nath Mondal, a 56-year-old farmer from Char Rajanar village in Murshidabad district, West Bengal, was subjected to by Border Security Force (BSF). OMCT is particularly concerned about the delays in initiating an effective investigation into these allegations.
According to the information received, on 1 March 2010 at around 12am, Mr. Birendra Nath Mondal was contacted by a Border Security Force (BSF) officer who asked him to go to Char Moirashi BSF camp to discuss “problems related to Indo-Bangladesh border”. The BSF officer also reportedly informed him that other members and head of the Panchayat were present in the camp. When Mr. Birendra Nath Mondal reached the said camp, nobody from the Panchayat was present. One Company Commander asked Mr. Birendra Nath Mondal to show his identity card, which he did. The Commander then reportedly asked him if he wanted to become a leader following which he was pulled into a vehicle and severely beaten. His gamchha (indigenous towel) was tied around his mouth and he was repeatedly beaten. He was then taken to Mohanganj BSF camp and later to Kaharpara BSF camp where he was detained and subsequently forced to sign on two blank pages. He was released at around 8pm after being threatened with death.
On 2 March 2010, Mr. Birendra Nath Mondal reportedly tried to lodge a complaint with the Raninagar Police Station but the police refused, following which he sent a written complaint to the Superintendent of Police, Murshidabad district, on 4 March 2010. No investigation has yet been initiated on the case. Mr. Birendra Nath Mondal is reportedly still suffering from injuries on different parts of his body (including damage to his left ear). He was treated at the hospital thanks to the assistance of MASUM.
According to the same information, previously on 25 February 2010, during an event organised by MASUM, Mr. Birendra Nath Mondal had reported a corruption case involving BSF officers which took place on 19 February 2010. Mr. Birendra Nath Mondal had also tried to file a case with the police but to no avail.
The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned about the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Birendra Nath Mondal, in particular following the death threats by the BSF. Furthermore, OMCT wishes to recall that according to article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which India is a State Party, “no one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment”. OMCT is also concerned by the delays in initiating an investigation into these allegations and fears that the perpetrators may enjoy impunity. Indeed, OMCT has reported several cases in which local police having jurisdiction along the Indo-Bangladesh border have consistently avoided taking any action against the BSF whenever a crime is reported against a BSF officer at the police station.
Accordingly, OMCT calls on the competent authorities to carry out a prompt, effective, thorough, independent and impartial investigation into these events, in particular the allegations of ill-treatment as well as the death threats, the result of which must be made public, in order to bring those responsible before a competent, independent and impartial tribunal and apply penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions as provided by law.
