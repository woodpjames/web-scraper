Zimbabwe

The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint
programme of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World
Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent intervention in the
following situation in Zimbabwe.
Description of the situation:
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the
continuing acts of harassment and intimidation faced by Mr. Abel Chikomo,
Executive Director of the Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum in Zimbabwe (the
Forum).
According to the information received, on
March 14, 2011, Mr. Abel Chikomo was summoned by the Law and Order Section of
the Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) at the Harare Central Police station. Mr.
Abel Chikomo, accompanied by his lawyer, Mr.
Harrison Nkomo, was interrogated by a police officer on the work carried out by
the Forum and its legal status. He was then informed that the investigating officer
in charge was away and had not left the file or any instructions. Mr. Abel
Chikomo was then allowed to leave the Police station and informed that he will
be summoned to appear on a later date. Mr. Abel Chikomo had to report on March
15, 2011 in the afternoon and was told that he would be summoned again at a
later stage. 
Over the last months, Mr. Abel Chikomo has
been interrogated and asked to report to the police on several occasions.
According to the information received, these summons were related to activities
carried out by the Forum, in particular the Campaign against Torture, the Transitional Justice
National Survey
and several press statements issued in 2011 on the resurgence of politically
motivated violence.
The Observatory is concerned that these acts form part of an ongoing
trend of harassment by the Zimbabwe Republic Police against the Forum and more
generally against human rights defenders in the country, in the run-up to the
referendum on the Constitution likely to take place in September 2011 and the
parliamentary elections due in November 2011.
The Observatory expresses its deepest concern about this summons and
fears for Mr. Abel Chikomo’s physical and psychological integrity. The
Observatory calls upon the Zimbabwe authorities to immediately and
unconditionally put an end to acts of intimidation and harassment against Mr.
Chikomo which merely seem to aim at sanctioning his human rights activities.
Background information
On November 11, 2010, Mr. Abel Chikomo was summoned by
Bulawayo Law and Order police regarding the Forum's public campaign against
torture. Bulawayo Law and Order police alleged that billboards put up by the
Forum and calling on the Government of Zimbabwe to ratify the Convention
against Torture and to outlaw torture were offensive.
On February 9, 2011, two days after the inception by
the Forum of a Transitional Justice National Survey, the Machipisa police in
Harare detained two researchers from the Forum and questioned them about this
survey. They released them only after receiving the assurance that Mr. Chikomo will report the next morning to the Machipisa Police
station. 
The next day, on February 10, 2011, Mr. Chikomo was
interrogated at the Machipisa Police Station about the work of the Forum. The
police also insisted on the fact that the Forum required police clearance to
carry out a survey and an authorisation from the Government of Zimbabwe. After
approximately two hours of questioning, the Machipisa police said it was a very
serious matter that required the intervention of the Harare Central Law and
Order Section. As a consequence, Mr. Chikomo was transferred to the latter   and questioned for more than six hours.
Detectives from the Harare Central Law and Order Section also visited the Forum
offices in the city of Harare on the same day accompanied by Mr. Chikomo. After
the visit, he was released without charges but the police insisted they will
call him later.
On March 10, 2011, two officers from the Harare Law
and Order Section visited the Forum offices and requested to meet Mr. Chikomo
who was at the time out of the office. They then asked for the organisation's registration
certificate and number under the Private Voluntary Organisations Act. The two
officers instructed that the Executive Director should report in person without
fail on March 14, as he has “questions to answer” and needs to provide the
certificate of registration.
