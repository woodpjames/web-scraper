Brief description of the situation The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Russian-Chechen Friendship Society (RCFS), a member of OMCT SOS-Torture Network, about the arbitrary arrest and risk for safety of Mr. Yury Staroverov, a press person of “The Other Russia” in Nizhny Novgorod and a staff member of the Russian-Chechen Friendship Society as well as of the Novaja Gazeta supplement in Nizhny Novgorod.  According to the information received, Mr. Yury Staroverov was arrested by UBOP (Department for Fighting Organised Crime) while on his way to the office of the Novaja Gazeta on 28 January 2009 but his arrest and whereabouts were only known on 29 January 2009, when he was brought to court. He was reportedly sentenced to five days of administrative detention (under article 20.1 of the Administrative Code) for alleged “cursing” (according to UBOP officer who arrested Mr. Yury Staroverov, he was cursing while standing alone in the staircase of the Novaja Gazeta office building). He is currently being detained at a police placement centre (54 Pakhomov Street) in Nizhny Novgorod. According to the same information received, Mr. Yury Staroverov had been accused on the “Decembrists” case (peaceful seizure of the President’s office in December 2004), for which he had spent one year in Federal Security Service (FSB) investigation prison and then sentenced to three years, sentence which was then suspended. His probation term was over in December 2008 but he had reportedly remained under surveillance by the Department monitoring the execution of punishment. The International Secretariat of OMCT is concerned about the safety of Mr. Yury Staroverov, in particular as he has already been reportedly subjected to numerous threats and provocation by UBOP and FSB officers. Furthermore, OMCT is concerned with regard to this arrest and sentencing as it seems solely based at sanctioning his political activities. Action requested Please write to the authorities of the Russian Federation urging them to:   Guarantee, in all circumstances, the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Yury Staroverov;  Guarantee access to his lawyer, family and to independent medical care;  Order his immediate release in the absence of valid legal charges that are consistent with international law and standards, or if such charges exist, bring him before an impartial and competent tribunal and guarantee his procedural rights at all times;  Order a prompt, thorough, impartial and independent investigation into these events in order to identify all those responsible, bring them to trial and apply the civil, penal and/or administrative sanctions as provided by law;  Guarantee adequate reparation to the victim;  Guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
