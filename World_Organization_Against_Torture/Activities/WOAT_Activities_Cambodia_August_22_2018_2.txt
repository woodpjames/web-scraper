The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint
partnership of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and FIDH, has received
new information and requests your urgent intervention in the following
situation in Cambodia.
 
New information:
 
The
Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the release of land
rights defender and Boeung Kak
community representative Ms. Tep
Vanny, after being detained for 735 days in
relation to a peaceful protest she attended in 2013.
 
According to
the information received, on August 20, 2018, Ms. Tep Vanny was freed from jail
after she received a royal pardon.
 
The
Observatory welcomes Ms. Tep Vanny’s release but recalls that she should have never been detained and prosecuted in the first place,
as her arbitrary detention was clearly aimed at punishing her legitimate human
rights activities.
 
The
Observatory calls upon the Cambodian authorities to ensure that she will not be
subjected to any further reprisals and to put
an end to all acts of harassment - including at the judicial level - against
all human rights defenders in Cambodia and to guarantee that they can
carry out their activities free of any hindrance or reprisals.
 
Background information:
 
Ms. Tep
Vanny played a prominent role in mobilising Phnom Penh’s Boeung Kak communities
to fight against an eviction order issued by the Government to authorize a
private company to carry out development plans that included filling in 90% of
the lake in the area in order to build tourism infrastructure. She is one of
the 13 women human rights defenders (the ‘Boeung Kak 13’) who were charged,
convicted, and sentenced to two years and six months’ imprisonment in 2012 as a
result of their work resisting these development plans.
 
On August
15, 2016, Ms. Tep Vanny and Ms. Bov
Sophea, another defender from the Boeung Kak community, were
arrested while participating in a peaceful protest
held by the Boeung Kak community in Phnom Penh to mark the 15th week
of the ‘Black Monday’ campaign. The campaign involved weekly peaceful protests,
held on Mondays, during which participants wore black clothing to call for the
release of human rights defenders Messrs. Ny
Sokha, Yi Soksan, Nay Vanda, Ny Chakrya, and Ms. Lim Mony,
as well as for justice for the murder of prominent political analyst Mr. Kem Ley[1].
 
Following their arrest, Ms. Tep Vanny and Ms. Bov Sophea were
initially detained at the Daun Penh district police station before being sent
to pre-trial detention in Prey Sar’s CC2 prison in Phnom Penh on August 17,
2016. On that day, both were charged with
“incitement” under Article 495 of Cambodia’s Criminal Code, after a day
of interrogation at the Phnom Penh Municipal Court. They were immediately sent
to trial, which was adjourned until August 22, 2016.
 
On August
22, 2016, following a 90-minute trial and after just 18 minutes of
deliberation, presiding judge Pech Vicheator unexpectedly changed the charge to
“insult of a public official” (Article 502 of the Criminal Code) during the
delivery of the verdict. After presenting a defence against the original charge
of incitement, the defendants’ lawyers were given no opportunity to prepare a
defence against the new charge. The two
activists were convicted of “insulting a public official” and sentenced
to six days in prison.
 
While Ms.
Bov Sophea was released on the evening of August 22, 2016, on time served, Ms.
Tep Vanny was brought back to CC2 prison, after an additional charge was
brought against her. On August 19, 2016, the Phnom Penh Municipal Court had
charged her with “intentional violence with aggravating circumstances” under
Article 218 of the Criminal Code. The charge stemmed from Ms. Tep Vanny’s participation
in a protest near Prime Minister Hun Sen’s house in March 2013 that called for
the release of then-jailed Boeung Kak activist
Ms. Yorm Bopha[2].
The protest turned violent when state security forces beat 10 of the activists
and pushed others into police trucks.
 
On January
25, 2017, Supreme Court Judge Kim Sathavy rejected
Ms. Tep Vanny’s second appeal for bail.
 
On February
23, 2017, the Phnom Penh Municipal Court convicted Ms. Tep Vanny on charges of
“intentional violence with aggravated circumstances” (Article 218
of the Criminal Code) and sentenced her to two
years and six months’ imprisonment for her participation in the March 2013
protest. Ms. Tep Vanny
was also ordered to pay a fine of five million riel (about EUR 1,150), as well
as compensation payments of four million riel (about EUR 920) to the first
plaintiff and five million riel to the second plaintiff, both members of Daun
Penh district para-police. During the trial, no credible evidence was presented
to either justify the charges brought against Ms. Tep Vanny or to prove that
any violence had been committed against the para-police.
 
On August 8, 2017, the
Court of Appeal upheld the Phnom Penh Municipal Court’s conviction and prison
sentence.
 
On
February 7, 2018, the Supreme Court rejected Ms. Tep
Vanny’s appeal against her conviction on charges of “intentional violence with
aggravating circumstances” for her
participation in the March 2013 protest and upheld her 30-month prison
sentence.
 
In another
case, on September 19, 2016, presiding judge Ly Sokleng sentenced Ms. Tep Vanny and three other Boeung Kak community representatives,
Ms. Bo
Chhorvy, Ms. Kong Chantha, and Ms. Heng Mom, who was
tried in absentia, to six months’ imprisonment after a three-hour
hearing at the Phnom Penh Municipal Court. The four defenders were found guilty
of “insult [of a public official]” and “obstruction of a public official with
aggravating circumstances” (Articles 502 and 504 of the Criminal Code) relating
to a November 2011 protest that called for a resolution to the Boeung Kak land
dispute and turned violent when police and security guards were sent in to
disperse demonstrators[3]. Ms. Bo Chhorvy and Ms. Kong Chantha were not arrested, as
all appeals had not been exhausted.
 
On
February 27, 2017, the Court of Appeal upheld the convictions and prison
sentences of Ms. Tep Vanny, Ms. Bo Chhorvy, and Ms. Kong Chantha.
 
On December
8, 2017, the Supreme Court rejected the appeals of
Ms. Tep Vanny, Ms. Bo Chhorvy, and Ms. Kong Chantha and upheld the Court of
Appeal’s six-month prison sentences for the three on charges of “insult [of a
public official]” and “obstruction of a public official with aggravating
circumstances” under Articles 502 and 504 of the Criminal Code.

The Boeung Kak community in Phnom Penh was one of the
co-implementing partners of the #FreeThe5KH campaign, launched on August 8,
2016 by civil society groups in support of the five human rights defenders who
were remained in pre-trial detention for 427 days
for allegations of bribery, before being released on bail in the wake of sustained international pressure in June
2017. Yet they still face 5 to 10 years in
prison, and their freedom of movement and ability to carry out human rights
work remains hindered.

Press Release, issued on September 4, 2013.


[3]                
During the 2011 protest, the
activists were demanding that 94 Boeung Kak families be included in a land plot
that Prime Minister Hun Sen had promised to set aside for displaced members of
the community.
Violence broke out when
police blocked about 100 women from walking towards Monivong Boulevard.
