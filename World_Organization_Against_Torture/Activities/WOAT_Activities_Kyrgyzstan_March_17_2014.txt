The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of
the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation
Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent intervention in the following
situation in Kyrgyzstan.
 
Description
of the situation:
 
The Observatory was informed by
reliable sources about renewed acts of harassment targeting human rights defenders
and NGOs in Kyrgyzstan, in particular those advocating for the rights of
Lesbians, Gays, Bisexuals and Transexuals (LGBT).
 
According to the information
received, in March 2014, Mr. Ilya Lukash, an ethnic-Ukrainian known for
his active participation in the defence of the human rights, was compelled to
leave Kyrgyzstan, following a series of threats and beatings sustained in
December 2013 by unknown individuals. Moreover, on February 27, 2014, during an
“action against homosexual propaganda”, members of the youth nationalist
movement “Kalis” had burned his portrait in front of the Embassy of the United
States in Bishkek, calling him a ““gay activist” who was supposedly
attempting to foment a Ukraine-style revolution in the country”.
 
The Observatory was also informed
that on March 12, 2014, about 150 activists of the “Kalis” movement
demonstrated in front of the Parliament in Bishkek to request that the
parliamentarians pass the draft law on so-called “foreign agents”, which
forbids the financing of NGOs working on LGBT rights and ban so-called
“homosexual propaganda” in Kyrgyzstan. 
 
The Observatory is seriously
concerned about the fact that harassment towards LGBT activists is visibly
encouraged by members of Parliament. Following the above-mentioned
demonstration, the Vice-Speaker of Parliament Torobay Zulpukarov indeed met
with the leader of the “Kalis” movement, Mr. Zhenish Moldokmatov, to inform him
that a bill currently being tabled in Parliament was aiming at bringing changes
and additions in certain legislative acts in order to forbid so-called
“homosexual propaganda”. The latter reportedly stated on that occasion that the
absence of such legislation was the cause of “increased quantity of
homosexuals” likely to spread “immorality” in the future.
 
On the same day, a member of the
parliamentary group “Ata Meken” Mr. Zhomart Saparbaev commented the
demonstration with the agency AKIpress,
and showed his hostility towards homosexuals and
same-sex marriage.

The Observatory is all
the more concerned as on January 30, 2014, Acting Grand Mufti Maksat Hajji
Toktomushev reportedly issued a fatwa against same sex relations, saying the
government should be wary of “public organisations that disseminate social
discord”. 
The Observatory recalls
that NGOs in Kyrgyzstan are under constant threats and harassment because of their human
rights activities in support of LGBT rights, but also because of their
criticism of the government and their denunciations of acts of torture and
ill-treatment in prisons. 
 
In particular, the Human Rights
Centre “Bir Duino” and its members have been harassed since 2012 in connection
with their attempt to show the film “I am
Gay and Muslim” during the 6th International Film Festival on
Human Rights. Since then, the offices of “Bir Duino” have been burgled twice,
i.e. on July 2013 and on December 26, 2013. Alongside, the Head of “Bir Duino”
and FIDH Vice President Ms. Tolekan Ismailova as well as her family have
faced a series of acts of harassment since the beginning of 2014. All these
acts merely aim at sanctioning the human rights activities carried out by “Bir
Duino”[1].
 
The Observatory condemns the repeated
attacks and harassment against LGBT rights activities in Kyrgyzstan, and calls
upon the Kyrgyz authorities to ensure that all human rights defenders can
continue their legitimate work. The Observatory further urges the members of
the Kyrgyz Parliament to refrain from passing laws forbidding so-called
“homosexual propaganda” and labelling NGOs as so-called “foreign agents”, and
rather to promote and protect the full enjoyment of the right to promote human
rights.
 
Actions
requested:
 
 i. Guarantee in all circumstances
the physical and psychological integrity of all human rights defenders in
Kyrgyzstan;
 
ii. Order
an immediate, thorough, transparent investigation into the above-mentioned
threats and harassment against Mr. Ilya Lukash as well as against Ms. Tolekan
Ismailova, her relatives and the premises of the Human Rights Movement “Bir
Duino”, in order to identify all those responsible, bring them before an
independent tribunal, and apply them the sanctions provided by the law;
 
iii. Put
an end to all acts of harassment against all human rights defenders in
Kyrgyzstan, by refraining from passing the restrictive pieces of legislation
mentioned above and by condemning publicly all acts of hostility towards human
rights, including LGBT rights, and their defenders;
 
iv. Comply
with all the provisions of the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights
Defenders, in particular with:
- its
Article 1, which provides that “everyone has the right, individually and in
association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and
realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and
international levels”;
- its
Article 5 (a): “For the purpose of promoting and protecting human rights and
fundamental freedoms, everyone has the right, individually and in association
with others, at the national and international levels (a) To meet or assemble
peacefully”;
 
v. Ensure
in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in
accordance with international human rights standards and international
instruments ratified by Kyrgyzstan.
