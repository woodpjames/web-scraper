Provisional release / 
Judicial harassment
Turkey
January 17, 2012
 
The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint 
programme of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World 
Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), has received new information and requests 
your urgent intervention in the following situation in Turkey.
 
New information:
 
The Observatory has been informed by the Human Rights Association 
(İnsan Haklari Derneği - İHD) about the provisional release of seven 
members and executives of İHD Şanliurfa branch, the Education and Science 
Workers’ Trade Union (Eğitim-Sen) and the Health and Social Service Workers’ 
Trade Union (SES).
 
According to the information received, on January 9, 2012, the 
Diyarbakır Heavy Penal Court No. 7 ordered the provisional release of Mr. 
Cemal Babaoğlu, İHD Şanlıurfa branchChairperson, Mr. Halit Şahin, 
Eğitim-Sen Şanlıurfa branch Chairperson, Mr. Yasin Öztürkoğlu, Eğitim-Sen 
member, Mr. Müslüm Kına, İHD executive, Messrs. Hikmet Evin, 
Adil Arslan and Adile Şahin, SES members, who had all been placed 
in detention following the raids against Eğitim-Sen’s, İHD and SES’s Şanlıurfa 
Branch offices in Şanlıurfa province on September 27, 2011 (See background 
information). However, the seven remain prosecuted.
 
The Observatory welcomes the release of the seven members and 
executives of Eğitim-Sen’s, İHD and SES’s Şanlıurfa branch offices and thanks 
all the persons, institutions and organisations who intervened in their favour. 
However, the Observatory remains deeply concerned by the fact that 
charges for “making propaganda of an illegal organisation” under Article 7/2 of 
the Anti-Terrorism Law, which seem to merely aim at sanctioning their human rights activities, 
remain pending against them and calls upon the Turkish authorities to put an end 
to the continuing harassment against them as well as against all human rights 
defenders in Turkey.
 
Background information:
 
On September 27, 2011, in Şanlıurfa, law-enforcement officers raided 
İHD, Egitim-Sen and SES Şanlıurfa Branch offices as well as the houses of their 
chairpersons and executives and arrested 31 members of these organisations. The 
police was in possession of a warrant from the Şanlıurfa Chief Public 
Prosecution Office mentioning allegations of “propaganda for an illegal 
organisation” and “participating in activities in line with the action and aims 
of that organisation” and, on the date of publication of this appeal, has denied 
to release information on the reasons of the raids and arrest, on the basis of 
legal provisions pertaining to the fight against terrorism. 

 
Among those arrested were Messrs. Cemal Babaoğlu, Müslüm Kına, İHD 
executive Müslüm Çiçek, Halit Şahin, Eğitim-Sen former Branch President Sıtkı Dehşet, 
Eğitim-Sen executive Veysi Özbingöl, Yasin Öztürkoğlu, Hikmet Evin, Adil Arslan and Adile 
Şahin. 
 
On September 30, 2011, seven of the 31 initially arrested, namely 
Messrs. Cemal Babaoğlu, Halit Şahin, Yasin Öztürkoğlu, Hikmet Evin, Adil 
Arslan and Adile Şahin, were formally charged for “making propaganda of an illegal organisation” under Article 7/2 of 
the Anti-Terrorism Law and placed in provisional detention. The other 24 members of 
above-mentioned NGOs were released without charges.

i. Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological 
integrity of Messrs. Cemal Babaoğlu, Müslüm Kına, Müslüm Çiçek, Halit Şahin,

national and international levels”, as well as Article 12.2, which provides that 
“the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the 
competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, 
against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse
