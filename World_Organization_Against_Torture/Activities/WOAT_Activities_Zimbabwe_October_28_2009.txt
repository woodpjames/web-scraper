Brief description of the situation : The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the arbitrary arrest and subsequent release on bail of Ms. Dadirai Chikwengo, Board Chairperson of the National Association of Non Governmental Organisations (NANGO), and Mr. Cephus Zinhumwe, NANGO Chief Executive Officer.  According to the information received, on October 24, 2009, Ms. Dadirai Chikwengo and Mr. Cephus Zinhumwe were arrested at the airport of Victoria Falls by members of the Zimbabwe Republic Police and the Central Organisation after participating in the Annual NGO Directors Summer School[1] in this resort town, allegedly for contravening the Public Order and Security Act by holding a “public and/or political meeting without police clearance”. On October 27, 2009, Ms. Dadirai Chikwengo and Mr. Cephus Zinhumwe were remanded out of custody on a US$ 100 bail each, following decision of Victoria Falls Magistrate Richard Ramaboea. Charged with contravening Section 25(1)(b) of the Public Order and Security Act or allegedly failing to notify the regulating authority of an intention to hold a "public political gathering", Ms. Dadirai Chikwengo and Mr. Cephus Zinhumwe will appear in court again on November 25, 2009. The arrest and prosecution of Ms. Chikwengo and Mr. Zinhumwe come up when various news articles and opinion pieces in the State-controlled media attacked and libelled NGOs openly, accusing them of working for the interests of the “West” and of the main opposition party Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). The Observatory expresses its deep concern about the arbitrary arrest and judicial harassment of Ms. Dadirai Chikwengoand and Mr. Cephus Zinhumwe, and believes that their arrest and prosecution are directly related to their human rights activities. The Observatory is concerned that this forms part of an ongoing trend of harassment human rights defenders in Zimbabwe, and urges Zimbabwe authorities to put an end to harassment against all human rights defenders, and to comply with the relevant international norms and standards, in particular the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders.
