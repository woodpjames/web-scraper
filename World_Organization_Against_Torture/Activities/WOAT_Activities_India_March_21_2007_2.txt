New information: The Observatory has been informed by People’s Watch of the release of Mr. Gopen Sharma, District Human Rights Officer of People’s Watch’s “National Project on Prevention of Torture in India” (NPPT), in the Murshidabad District of West Bengal[1]. In the State of West Bengal, People’s Watch is implementing the NPPT in collaboration with MASUM, a human rights organisation involved in the denunciation of torture cases, headed by Mr. Kirity Roy, MASUM President, as its State Director. According to the information received, on March 15, 2007, the Judicial Magistrate of Calcutta decided to release on bail Mr. Gopen Sharma. However, Mr. Sharma was effectively released on March 20, 2007, as he had to wait for the order to be correctly transmitted to the local district court. The Observatory thanks all the persons, organisations, and institutions, that intervened in favour of Mr. Sharma. However, the Observatory recalls that he remains prosecuted under Sections 420 (“cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property”), 468 (“forgery for purpose of cheating”) and 471 (“using as genuine a forged document”), of the Indian Penal Code, and faces up to ten years’ imprisonment. Moreover, the Observatory has been informed of the arbitrary arrest of Mr. Vasanth, the husband of Ms. Shyla, District Human Rights Officer of People’s Watch NPPT, in the Coorg District of Karnataka, and also a human rights activist, on March 8, 2007. He was arrested while visiting the Medikeri Town Police Station in the Kodagu District of Karnataka in order to collect information on a torture case, before being released on bail and free of charge on the following day. He was reportedly beaten by the police while in custody. Background information: On February 8, 2007, Mr. Gopen Sharma had been arbitrarily arrested by police officers while visiting the Kaharpara Border Out Post of the Border Security Force (BSF) camp in order to collect information on three cases of human rights violations that would have been committed by the BSF, following complaints lodged to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC). During his arrest, Mr. Gopen Sharma was reportedly threatened and insulted by a police officer, who accused him of filing complaints with human rights groups against the police and the BSF. In addition, the police seized all documents and papers regarding the complaints to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) and Mr. Gopen Sharma’s mobile phone. These events followed a fact-finding mission carried out on February 1, 2007 by Mr. Henri Tiphagne, Executive Director of People’s Watch, Mr. Kirity Roy, Mr. Biplap Mukherjee, State Programme Coordinator of the NPPT for West Bengal, and Mr. Gopen Sharma, to make inquiries into human rights violations perpetrated by police officers against local villagers. When the fact-finding team reached the area, the BSF staff at the BSF Khayer Tala Border Out Post threatened and harassed the four human rights activists. Action requested: Please write to the Indian authorities and ask them to :  take all necessary measures to guarantee, in all circumstances, the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Gopen Sharma and Mr. Vasanth, as well as all individuals working for People’s Watch and its related projects; bring him before an impartial and competent tribunal, and guarantee his procedural rights at all times; conduct a fair, impartial and independent inquiry into the allegations of ill-treatment against Mr. Vasanth in order to identify the authors, bring them to justice and pronounce sentences proportional to the gravity of their crimes; put an end to any kind of reprisals against human rights defenders in India; comply with the provisions of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 9, 1998, in particular article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually or collectively, to promote the protection and fulfilment of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, as well as article 12.2, which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually or in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”; guarantee the respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and other international human rights instruments ratified by India.
