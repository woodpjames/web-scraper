New Information  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by a reliable source that the detention order for the 9 detainees listed below expires on September 23rd, 2003. These 9 people have been detained without trial since their arrests in August of 2001 and, under the Internal Security Act (ISA), their detention orders can be renewed indefinitely by the Home Minister without even going to court.    According to the information received, the persons arrested under the ISA between August 2nd and August 4th include:   ·	Asfawani Abdullah (arrested in Kuala Keti, Kedah);  ·	Abu Bakar Che Doi (arrested in Tilam Batu, Kedah);  ·	Zainun Ismail (PAS youth leader, arrested in Baling, Kedah);  ·	Solehan Abdul Ghaffar (arrested on August 2nd in Wakaf Tembesu, Terengganu);  ·	Alias Ngah (arrested on August 2nd in Manir, Terengganu);  ·	Ahmad Pozi Darman (Ulu Tilam, Johor);  ·	Ahmad Tajuddin Abu Bakar (PAS Larut Youth Chief, arrested on August 2nd in the state of Perak);  ·	Nik Adli Nik Abdul Aziz (son of Chief Minister of PAS party in Kelantan, arrested on August 4th in Kota Baharu, Kelantan);  ·	Mohd Lothfi Ariffin (arrested on August 4th Kg Sidek Kupang, Kedah).   In the past, the ISA has been used repeatedly to contain the democratic movement and opposition leaders in the country. Many have remained in detention for years without trial and suffered inhumane treatment in detention including torture.   The International Secretariat of OMCT urges that the detainees being held under the Internal Security Act are released or charged in an open court. OMCT condemns the ISA’s history of violating the right to trial and the right to counsel. OMCT fears that if the detention order is renewed, the detainees continue to be at risk of being subjected to ill-treatment, including poor detention conditions, a lack of access to their families, lawyers, medical assistance, and that they may potentially be tortured. OMCT continues to urge the Malaysian authorities to reconsider the ISA as a whole.  Brief reminder of the situation   According to the information received, 10 persons, including Parti Islam SeMalaysia (PAS) opposition party members, were under the Internal Security Act (ISA) during the first week of August 2001.  According to the information received, Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir has claimed that the PAS party was holding a series of gatherings despite a ban on such activities, in order to force the Government to arrest participants under the ISA, leading to an increase in the growing popular anti-Government sentiment. This ban has been criticised by Suhakam, the Malaysian Human Rights Commission. Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, however, has denied that these arrests were part of a police crackdown on PAS. In contradiction, Police Chief Norian Mai has stated that the arrests under the ISA were conducted on suspicion of these persons being members of a group known as “Mujahedin Group”, who are accused of waging an Islamic “holy war,” adding that all of them had undergone training in Afghanistain.  According to the information received, leader Norashid Sakip was arrested under the article 73 of the ISA. Little is known at this time concerning the circumstances of the arrests of the other nine men, except for the fact that no official reasons for their arrests have been given and no charges have been brought against them.  Action requested  Please write to the authorities in Malaysia urging them to:  i.	take all necessary measures to guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of the above-mentioned persons;  ii.	order their immediate release in the absence of valid legal charges or, if such charges exist, bring them before an impartial and competent tribunal and guarantee their procedural rights at all times; iii.	guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
