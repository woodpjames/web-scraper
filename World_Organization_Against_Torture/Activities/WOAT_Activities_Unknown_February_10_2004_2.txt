The implementation of articles 37 and 40 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child is monitored once every 5 years by the Committee on the Rights of the Child as part of the overall examination of State Parties reports to the Convention - which usually do not reflect juvenile justice practice, but only refer to legislation. Non-parties to the Convention do not benefit from this monitoring. Other treaty monitoring bodies rarely refer to the specifics of juvenile justice. And there is no UN or other relevant body in charge of guaranteeing the implementation and monitoring of key UN instruments related to juvenile justice (Riyadh guidelines, Beijing Rules, etc.).  Yet, all year long, OMCT’s children’s rights programme has denounced acts of torture or severe threats during police custody, the  and the imposition of abusive punishments contrary to the principles enshrined in the Convention on the Rights of the Child, as well as inhuman and degrading conditions of detention imposed on children as young as 7 in certain countries.  OMCT warmly welcomes the increased attention given to this issue by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, notably through targeted examination of State parties reports, the preparation of a general comment on principles of juvenile justice and the planning of a future thematic discussion on the issue of children deprived of their liberty. OMCT welcomes the technical assistance provided by UNICEF and UNDP for juvenile justice reform in certain countries, as well as the inclusion of juvenile justice as one priority area of UNICEF’s child protection activities. But OMCT is very concerned by the absence of strong a commitment to monitoring and implementation of juvenile justice standards by the UN Commission on Human Rights.  Finally, since the Commission on Human Rights resolution on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment "reminds Governments that corporal punishment, including of children, can amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment or even to torture", OMCT is strongly concerned that the legislation of some countries, such as Iran, Saudi Arabia and Sudan, still include provisions enabling children to be subjected to corporal punishment, such as amputation, stoning and flogging. OMCT further believes that torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment and punishment have a specific impact on children that must be recognised and sanctioned appropriately. Acts of torture committed against children not only inflict immediate physical and psychological damage, but also lead to developmental problems and diminished physical and psychological capacities over a lifetime. In that respect, it is regretful that the resolutions of 2002 and 2003 committed to recommend the Special Rapporteur on torture to take special note of the situation of children as it did in the 2001 resolution.  OMCT would thus urge the UN Commission on Human Rights to:  ·  Create a special mechanism on Violence against Children in order to, inter alia, solicit, receive and exchange information and communications, including individual complaints and on systematic violations, from all relevant sources, including from children themselves, on any form of violence or ill-treatment they may be subjected to, as well as its causes and consequences; to undertake investigations; and to take appropriate measures and urgent actions – including in the field of juvenile justice. This special mechanism should interact with all relevant UN mechanisms, with relevant regional bodies and with national and international NGOs, and seek the views of children, including those who are detained ; ·  Request all States to develop juvenile justice systems and special procedures in line with all relevant international standards on juvenile justice, with special support to diversion, mediation procedures and alternatives to imprisonment for all under 18 in conflict with the law; ·  Request all States to report on the reality, practice and progress of juvenile justice reforms in their country to all treaty monitoring bodies, under relevant articles of each treaty.   And finally to.  ·  Recognise the special vulnerability of children to torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and reiterate member States' obligations to prevent and remedy such violations;  ·  condemn member States whose legislation still include provisions enabling children to be subjected to corporal punishment, such as amputation, stoning and flogging; ·  Recommend the Special Rapporteur on Torture to take special note of the situation of children and to actively cooperate with the independent expert on the UN Study on Violence Against Children in order to highlight and document the scope of the phenomenon of torture of children worldwide.
