Description of the situation: The Observatory has been informed by Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights (ZLHR) about the arrest and subsequent arbitrary detention of Ms. Jenni Williams, a leader of Women of Zimbabwe Arise (WOZA), and other members of WOZA and one member of Men of Zimbabwe Arise (MOZA), as well as of acts of harassment against members of the Crisis in Zimbabwe Coalition, among them Mr. Philimon Sajeni. According to the information received, on May 28, 2008, Ms. Williams and 13 other human rights defenders and political opponents, mostly women human rights defenders and one male activist of the WOZA/MOZA, were arrested in Harare while demonstrating against the current wave of political violence. They were detained well beyond the legally permissible 48 hours and only appeared in court after 4 pm on May 30, 2008. On May 31, 2008, the court ordered their release on bail, but the State appealed against the findings of the court. Therefore, the group remained in custody, and has been detained at Harare Remand Prison up to date. The Observatory was further informed that on May 30, 2008, Law & Order officers and some suspected Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO) agents entered the Crisis in Zimbabwe Coalition offices and arrested Mr. Sajeni and another employee of the Coalition. They searched the office for broadcasting equipment and drove the two victims around for some time before releasing them with no charges. Moreover, on June 2, 2008, four men likely to be members of the CIO arrived at the offices of the Coalition in an unmarked Mercedes Benz and began harassing the guard to learn about the purpose and the activities of the coalition. As the guard did not open the gate, the four men left but warned that they would be back. The Observatory expresses its deep concern about the arbitrary arrest, ongoing arbitrary detention and harassment of the above-mentioned human rights defenders, in a context of increasing repression against all persons who have been involved in the human rights monitoring of the March 2008 election process. The Observatory further recalls that according to Article 1 of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”. Actions required: Please write to the authorities of Zimbabwe urging them to:   Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Ms. Jenni Williams, Mr. Philimon Sajeni, members of WOZA/MOZA and of the Crisis in Zimbabwe Coalition, as well as of all human rights defenders in Zimbabwe;  Release Ms. Williams and the 15 WOZA/MOZA activists as their detention is arbitrary since it only aims at sanctioning their human rights activities;  Put an end to all kinds of harassment, including at the judicial level, against all human rights defenders in Zimbabwe;  Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its above-mentioned Article 1 and article 12.2, which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the [...] Declaration”;  Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by Zimbabwe.
