New information: The Observatory has been informed by the Civic Assistance Committee (CAC) of the attack against Mr. Bakhrom Khamroev, one of its member. According to the information received, in the evening of January 14, 2007, Mr. Khamroev was attacked by a group of unknown individuals, near the subway station “Toul’skaya” in Moscow, as he was entering the station. The attackers caught him from behind, and kicked him in his face, head and kidneys. Mr. Khamroev was then left on the ground. Later, Mr. Khamroev was examined by a doctor who diagnosed a brain concussion, and noticed numerous contusions on his body. Following this event, a criminal investigation was opened by the subway police, but the assailants have not been identified yet. Mr. Khamroev fled from Uzbekistan in 1992, where he was a member of the opposition party “Birlik”, following a wave of repression against opposition parties. In 1995, he obtained the Russian nationality and settled in, and started to work in Moscow with the Civic Assistance Committee, which supports refugees. Mr. Khamroev would reportedly have been threatened and followed several times before his attack. The Observatory strongly condemns this attack, which could be linked with Mr. Khamroev’s activities in favour of human rights in Russia, and which occurs in the context of an increasing climate of hostility against human rights defenders and a growth in xenophobia and racism, directed at foreigners and minorities. Actions required: Please write to the Russian authorities urging them to:  Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Bakhrom Khamroev; Conduct a fair and impartial inquiry into those acts in order to identify their authors, bring them to justice and sanction them according to law; Put an end to any act of harassment against all human rights defenders in the Russian Federation; Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, article 12.2, which states that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration; Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by the Russian Federation.
