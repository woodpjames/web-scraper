Brief description of the situationThe International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Sudan Organisation Against Torture (SOAT), a member of OMCT network, about the arbitrary arrests, detention and torture of Mr. Omar Altaj Al-Nageeb (25 yrs) by five men allegedly working for the security forces, on 12 June 2006.  According to the information received, Mr. Al-Nageeb - a recent medical graduate from Omdurman Islamic University, Omdurman - was arrested by these five men around 12.30 pm whilst distributing flyers in support of students suspended from the University for non payment of tuition fees. Mr. Al-Nageeb was taken to a Student Union room equipped with torture instruments, where he was subjected to severe torture and lost consciousness for periods of 10-20 minutes. The men blind-folded Mr. Al-Nageeb, tied both his feet and wrists, hanged him by the feet to a ceiling fan and attempted to insert a glass bottle into his anus. Mr. Al-Nageeb was beaten with a metal bar, water hose and chain lock and the men pointed guns to his head whilst threatening him with death. The men also attempted to strangle him using a rope and subjected his hands and facial cheeks to electric shock and forced him to sign documents obliging him to pay 1500,000 Sudanese Dinars.   It is reported that during his detention, Mr. Al-Nageeb was questioned about his membership and those of other students of the communist party. The men identified themselves as members of the security forces and the men of ‘Abu-Musab Al-Zarqwai’ group in Sudan. They demanded Mr. Al-Nageeb to give up his student activities and to join the security forces and work with them.   Ten hours after his detention, at 10.30 pm, Mr. Al-Nageeb was driven to a farm in Al Maygome, East Nile District where his blindfold was removed. After walking for approximately 30 minutes, Mr. Al-Nageeb reached a main road.   Mr. Al-Nageeb reported the incident to SOAT’s partner organization in Khartoum, Amel Centre for the Treatment and Rehabilitation of Victims of Torture where they confirmed his injuries as consistent to his account of torture and where he is currently receiving counseling.
