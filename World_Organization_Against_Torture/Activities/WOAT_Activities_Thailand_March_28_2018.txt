The Observatory for the Protection of Human
Rights Defenders, a partnership of FIDH and the World Organisation Against Torture
(OMCT), has received new information and requests
your urgent intervention in the following situation in Thailand.
 
New information:
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable
sources about the sentencing of Mr. Andy Hall, a migrant labour rights researcher.
 
According to the information received, on March
26, 2018, the Phra Khanong Provincial Court in Bangkok ordered Mr. Andy Hall to
pay 10 million baht (approximately 26,000 Euros) in damages to the Thai pineapple
processing company Natural Fruit. The Court also ordered Mr. Hall to pay 10,000
baht (approximately 260 Euros) for the plaintiff’s lawyer and the court fees,
in addition to a 7.5% interest from the date of filing this case. Mr. Hall will
appeal the sentence to the Supreme Court. 
 
The case dates back to February 2013 when
Natural Fruit brought charges against Mr. Hall for his contribution to a report
published by Finnish Non-governmental organisation Finnwatch which alleged
serious labour rights abuses by Natural Fruit and in relation to an interview he gave to Al-Jazeera
regarding the same report. This case is
only one of four criminal and civil lawsuits filed by Natural Fruit against Mr.
Hall (Case 4) (see background information).
 
The Observatory firmly condemns the ongoing
judicial harassment against Mr. Andy Hall, as it clearly aims at sanctioning
his legitimate human rights activities and calls upon the Thai authorities to
put an end to all forms of harassment, including at the judicial level, against
him.
 
Background
information:
 
Since February 2013, the Thai pineapple
processing company Natural Fruit has filed four criminal and civil lawsuits
against Mr. Andy Hall for defamation and computer crimes in relation to Mr.
Hall’s contribution to a report by the Finnish NGO Finnwatch that alleged
serious labour rights abuses at the company’s factory in Prachuap Khiri Khan
Province and in relation to an interview he gave to Al-Jazeera regarding
the same report[1].
Published in January 2013, the report, “Cheap has a high price: Responsibility problems
relating to international private label products and food production in
Thailand,”
gathered worker interviews in order to document labour rights violations at the
factory, including allegations of child labour, underpayment of wages,
confiscation of migrant workers’ travel and work documents, and failure to
provide legally mandated paid sick days, holidays, and leave[2].
 
On October 29, 2014, the Phra Khanong Provincial
Court dismissed the criminal defamation cases related to the Al-Jazeera interview[3],
due to Mr. Hall’s unlawful interrogation process under Article 120 of the
Criminal Procedure Code[4].
However, the Office of the Attorney General subsequently appealed the
court’s dismissal of the case. On September 18, 2015, the Court of Appeals upheld the
Phra Khanong Provincial Court’s dismissal of the case. In December 2015,
Natural Fruit and the Attorney General were given permission by the Attorney
General to appeal to the Supreme Court. In January 2016, the Attorney General
and Natural Fruit submitted their appeals on the case to the Supreme Court. Mr.
Hall’s legal team responded to the appeal, and on November 3, 2016, the Supreme
Court dismissed the criminal defamation charges (Case 3).
 
In September 2014, Natural Fruit also filed a
100 million Thai Baht civil defamation lawsuit against Mr. Hall, related to the
Al-Jazeera interview (Case 4). The
first hearing on this case took place on November 21, 2014 at the Phra Khanong
Provincial Court. Mr. Hall submitted his defence, and further hearings followed
in May/November 2015 and January/April 2016. This case was then also postponed
pending a final decision in the appeal to the Supreme Court in the criminal
defamation case related to the interview. In August 2017, following an appeal filed
by Natural Fruit, the Court of Appeals ordered the Prakanong Court to accept
jurisdiction and hear the case in full. The hearing of witnesses for the
reopened case concluded in February 2018.
 
On January 18, 2016, the Bangkok South Criminal
Court indicted Mr. Hall under Article 14(1) of the Computer Crimes Act and
Article 328 (libel) of the Criminal Code (Case 1).
 
Ahead of the indictment, on January 13, 2016,
the Bangkok South Criminal Court confiscated Mr. Hall’s passport and issued a
travel ban against him. The order was handed down following a temporary bail[5]
request submission. Mr. Hall was prohibited from leaving Thailand until the
court ruled on the case unless permission was granted (permission would have
been granted on a case-by-case basis). On September 20, 2016, the Bangkok South
Criminal Court revoked the order restricting Mr. Hall’s travel and returned his
passport.
 
On September 20, 2016, the Bangkok South
Criminal Court handed down a four-year sentence against Mr. Hall and a fine of
200,000 Thai Baht (about 5,160 Euros), on “criminal defamation” and “computer
crimes” charges. The court reduced the sentence to three years, with a two-year
suspended term and a fine of about 150,000 Thai Baht (3,870 Euros).
 
Natural Fruit filed a 300 million Thai Baht
civil defamation lawsuit against Mr. Hall following the publication of the
Finnwatch report case (Case 2). Negotiations between the two parties failed on
October 30, 2014, following which the Nakhon Pathom Court postponed
consideration of this case until a verdict had been reached in the criminal
defamation and computer crimes case. 
 
On November 7, 2016, Mr. Hall left Thailand fearing
for his safety amid legal threats and harassment from Natural Fruit.
