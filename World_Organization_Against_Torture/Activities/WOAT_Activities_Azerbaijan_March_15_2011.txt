The 
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of 
the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation 
Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent intervention in the following 
situation in Azerbaijan.
Description 
of the situation: 
The 
Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the closure of the Human 
Rights House Azerbaijan, partner of the international Human Rights House 
Network, following an order of the Ministry of Justice of the Republic of 
Azerbaijan issued on March 10, 2011. The Human Rights House Azerbaijan had 
neither received prior warnings nor any complaints about the regular and timely 
characters of its activity reports to the authorities.
According 
to the Ministry of Justice, the Human Rights House Azerbaijan will be allowed to 
carry out activities in the future only upon prior agreement with the State. A 
ministry official reportedly asserted that the organisation was indeed in breach 
of June 2009 amendments to the “Law on Non-governmental Organizations”, which 
require all international groups or their local affiliates in Azerbaijan to sign 
separate agreements with the government in order to be allowed to operate[1].
The 
Human Rights House Azerbaijan was registered in 2007 as a branch of the Human 
Rights House Foundation, and officially opened on April 25, 
2009.
The 
Observatory is deeply concerned about this order, which hinders the right to 
freedom of association in the country, thus contravening article 22 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ratified by Azerbaijan as 
well as article 5 of the Declaration on Human Rights 
Defenders, adopted on December 9, 1998 by the United Nations General 
Assembly.
 
Actions 
requested:
Please 
write to the authorities in Azerbaijan, urging them to:
 
i.              Repeal 
the order of the Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Azerbaijan issued on 
March 10, 2011;
ii.             Put 
an end to all acts of harassment against human rights NGOs and human rights 
defenders in Azerbaijan; 
iii.            Guarantee 
in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of all human 
rights defenders in Azerbaijan;
iv.            Conform 
with the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
and in particular its article 22;
v.             Conform 
with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by 
the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, 
especially:
 - 
its Article 1, which states that «everyone has the right, individually and in 
association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and 
realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and 
international levels”, 
 - 
its Article 5(c), which states that Article 5 (b) which provides that “for the 
purpose of promoting and protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms, 
everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, at the 
national and international levels to form, join and participate in 
non-governmental organizations, associations or groups”,
 - 
its Article 12.2, which provides that the “State shall «take all necessary 
measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, 
individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, 
retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other 
arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of his or 
her rights”; 
vi.            Ensure
