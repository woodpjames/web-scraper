Brief description of the situation: The Observatory has been informed by the Human Rights Information and Documentation Center (HRIDC) about judicial proceedings against Mr. Giorgi Getsadze, a member of the Public Defender’s Office in Georgia. According to the information received, Mr. Giorgi Getsadze is being prosecuted for “taking illegal actions while studying a case” under Article 145 of the Criminal Code of Georgia (“provocation of a crime”, i.e. “persuading others to commit a crime for the purpose of his/her criminal prosecution”). These proceedings would be founded on the basis of telephone conversations overheard by Georgian law enforcement bodies, during which Mr. Giorgi Getsadze was telling one of his colleagues about his visit in Geguti Penitentiary Establishment n°8. A couple of weeks before, a former employee of the Getuti Penitentiary Establishment n°8 had denounced the existence of money transfers to detainees. He described those as acts of corruption to the Public Defender’s Office. On November 1, 2006, in order to verify these allegations, Mr. Giorgi Getsadze visited the penitentiary establishment where he interviewed many people. According to the accusations, Mr. Giorgi Getsadze would allegedly have offered money to the prison staff during his visit in order to obtain information. The member of the Public Defender’s Office claimed that he only asked the prison staff about the possibility to transmit some money to detainees inside of the penitentiary establishment, to verify the dependability of the denunciations of corruption. Mr. Giorgi Getsadze faces one to three years of imprisonment or “restriction of freedom” (placement in a corrective centre)[1], under Article 145 of the Criminal Code. Since the beginning of 2006, the Public Defender’s Office has been denouncing human rights violations in Georgian penitentiary establishments to the General Prosecutor’s Office. Although investigations were launched, no sanction has been taken yet. The Observatory expresses its concern about these judicial proceedings which seem to be only intended to intimidate Mr. Giorgi Getsadze and to prevent him from carrying out his work in favour of the respect of human rights in Georgia. Actions requested: Please write to the authorities in Georgia urging them to:  Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Giorgi Getsadze, as well as of all human rights defenders in Georgia; Ensure that his rights to a fair and impartial trial be guaranteed in any circumstances; Put an end to acts of harassment against Mr. Giorgi Gesatdze as well as against all human rights defenders in Georgia; Comply with the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, in particular article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, and article 12.2, which declares that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually or in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”; More generally, ensure in all circumstances the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights instruments ratified by Georgia.
