Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Task Force Detainees of the Philippines (TFDP), a member of the OMCT network, of the arbitrary arrest, detention and torture of eleven members of a group of punks by elements of the 1604th Philippine National Police (PNP) from Camp Molintas in Buguias, Benguet. Among the eleven persons, who were arrested on 14 February 2006 between 11.30 am and noon, are two children: Runden Berloize G. Lao, Davao City Anderson Tabocanon Alonzo, 18 years old, Malagos, Baguio St., Purok 2, Calinan, Davao City Aldoz Christian Maòoza, 18 years old, #2 Sampaloc St., Santolan, Pasig City Ron Baquiran Pandino, 20 years old, Brgy.

When they reached the road near Camp Molintas the truck was stopped by elements of the PNP. The police elements allegedly asked the eleven persons where they kept the firearms that were confiscated from the military barracks in Mankayan, Benguet, during a gunfight earlier that week. Moreover, the eleven persons were accused by the police of being members of the New Peoples Army (NPA).   On that same day, the victims were handcuffed and brought to Camp Molintas in Buguias. The eleven persons were allegedly punched, slapped and kicked on various parts of their bodies during the interrogation by the said elements of the police. They were also blindfolded under the heat of the sun and electrocuted. Some of them were dumped in a hole that was later filled with soil. The genitals of other victims were whacked with wood. Due to the pain and the fear that they were going to be killed, the victims admitted that they are NPA members and that they were the ones who attacked the military barracks.   According to the information received, on the night of 16 February 2006 the police elements, while drinking liquor, once again interrogated and tortured the victims. Runden Berloize, the oldest one of the eleven persons and the alleged commanding officer, was able to escape that night. The following day, on 17 February 2006, he reached Baguio City where he went to the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) and the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) to ask for help. However, on that same day, he was again arrested by the PNP members, this time with a warrant of arrest. He was then brought to the Benguet Provincial Jail in La Trinidad, Benguet.  The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned for the physical and psychological integrity of the nine adults and two children.  OMCT is also gravely concerned by the continuous violations of human rights and individual liberties in the Philippines.   Action requestedPlease write to the authorities in the Philippines urging them to: i.	Ensure the physical and psychological integrity of the eleven above mentioned persons. ii.
