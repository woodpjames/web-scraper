The
Hungarian government tries to choke critical organisations who still dare to
speak up against human right violations.
The Hungarian government has
proposed a set of laws that if adopted will have a devastating and chilling
effect on civil society. 
The proposed
legislative package is part of a wider crackdown on human rights and civil
society organisations in Hungary, which have been under attack for several
years. It seeks to punish the legitimate work of civil society groups that defend
human rights, provide legal and social services, and offer support to people
seeking international protection.
The government’s goal is simple and clear: to silence
independent and openly critical NGOs. These include organisations such as Amnesty
International Hungary, the Hungarian Civil Liberties Union, the Hungarian
Helsinki Committee, among many others.
"This threatens the very existence of organisations doing
crucial work in Hungary”, said Julia Ivan, director Amnesty International Hungary.



These
  laws create a climate of fear and suspicion
If the new legislation is adopted,
  the government will be able to control and restrict the activities of
  independent human rights organisations in Hungary. 
The legislative
  package tabled to Parliament on 13 February, the so-called “Stop Soros” laws,
  would require national security clearance, a
  government permit and for identified NGOs that the government deems as
  “supporting migration”. This would include work such as campaigning,
  ‘influencing courts’, preparing information materials, organising networks
  and recruiting volunteers with the goal of sponsoring, organising or
  otherwise supporting the entry and stay of people seeking international
  protection. The laws would also require organisations to pay a tax of 25% of
  any foreign funding aimed at ‘supporting migration’.
Failure to meet
  these absurd requirements could lead to exorbitant fines, bankruptcy, and the
  dissolving of the NGOs targeted.
The government
  has presented these laws in the context of its wider anti-immigration
  campaign. In reality, these proposals have nothing to do with protecting national
  security or borders. They are a clear attempt to crush those working to
  assist people in need and to silence those who dare to raise their voices. 



 



What
  happens if the laws are adopted?
The law states that the
  authorities can ‘identify’ NGOs which it deems are ‘supporting
  migration’.  The wording is vague and
  open for interpretation, which gives the authorities the opportunity to
  target, and possibly close down, a wide range of organisations. 
1.    
  According to the proposed laws, the NGOs
  identified would need to get a permission from the Minister of Interior in
  order to continue their basic functions, including campaigning, advocacy,
  preparing information materials, organising networks and recruiting
  volunteers. 
2.    
  The Minister of the Interior would then
  involve national security services for security clearance. This procedure may
  take up to nine months.  
3.    
  The law would also require organisations
  to pay a tax of 25 per cent of any foreign funding aimed at ‘supporting
  migration’. If they refuse or are unable to pay, this could lead to high
  fines, deletion of the tax number, bankruptcy, and the dissolving of the
  organisation.



 Solidarity
Action with Civil Society in Hungary
The actions by the Hungarian
government are disturbing and unjustified. Again and again the authorities have
crossed red lines but this has not remained unseen.
The defenders of rights and freedoms
in Hungary are not alone, and an attack on them means an attack on all those
that dare to speak out and protect others. 
More than 250 organisations and
platforms across the world including the World Organisation Against Torture
(OMCT) have signed a solidarity letter stating their grave concern over the
proposed laws in Hungary, and showing their support to NGOs doing crucial work
and whose very existence is at risk. With one voice, civil society
organisations from around the world are urging the authorities to stop the
crackdown on human rights defenders.
Text of the
letter and signatories:
On 13 February 2018, the
Hungarian government tabled to Parliament a proposed legislative pack of three
laws, commonly referred to as “Stop Soros”. The newly proposed legislation
would further restrict Hungarian civil society ability to carry out their work,
by requiring organizations that “support migration” to obtain national security
clearance and a government permit to perform basic functions. The proposed law
would also require organizations to pay a tax of 25% of any foreign funding
aimed at “supporting migration”. 
Failure to do so, would
subject them to steps so serious that they could lead to exorbitant fines,
bankruptcy, and the dissolving of the NGO involved. 
These come in a context
of already shrinking space for civil society in Hungary and contravene
Hungary’s obligations under international law to protect the right to freedom
of association, expression and movement. 
We believe the new
proposals represent the latest initiative in the Hungarian government's
escalating effort to crackdown on the legitimate work of civil society groups
in Hungary seeking to promote and defend human rights, provide legal and social
services to people in need in the country, and publicly express dissenting
opinions in the press and online. 
As defenders of rights
and freedoms, we want people everywhere to be able to speak out without being
attacked, threatened or jailed. Open debate on matters relating to government
policies and practice is necessary in every society, and human rights defenders
should not face criminalization for voicing their sometimes dissenting voices.
Countries need to put laws in place which keep human rights defenders safe from
harm, rather than introducing repressive laws that aim to silence those who
speak out.  
Human rights defenders
defend the rights of people in their own communities and their countries, and
in doing so they protect all of our rights, globally. Human rights defenders
are often the last line of defence for a free and just society and undertake
immense personal risks and sacrifices to do their work. 
We stand in solidarity
with civil society and human rights defenders in Hungary. 
They are courageous
people, committed to creating a fairer society. Without their courage, the
world we live in would be less fair, less just and less equal.
We are calling on the
Hungarian Parliament to reject the proposed laws in their entirety and let the
NGOs and defenders continue their work, instead of defending themselves against
such attacks.
