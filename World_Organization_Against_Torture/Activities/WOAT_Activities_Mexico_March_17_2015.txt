express deep concern regarding recent reports according to which,
members of the Tlachinollan Human Rights Centre, as well as other human rights
organisations and the families and friends of the 43 disappeared students from
Ayotzinapa, continue to suffer security incidents, putting their physical and
psychological integrity at risk. 
Over the
past months, they have been the target of defamatory articles or statements in
the media and by authorities from the state of Guerrero which have tried to
link them to subversive groups. Similarly,
acts of aggression, regular surveillance and intimidation by different state
security forces during their peaceful protests have been reported by the
families and the human rights defenders who accompany them. These events are
part of a broader context of increased restrictions on the right to protest and
freedom of expression in Mexico. 
“Defamation,
stigmatization, surveillance and acts of aggression place both the family
members of the 43 disappeared students, and the HRDs who accompany them at
increased risk and serve to obstruct their legitimate work in the search for
truth” pointed out representatives of the international
organizations. 
In this
context, the signing organizations urge the Mexican state to:

·      
Take all necessary measures to
guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of the human rights
defenders involved in the case as well as the family members of the 43
disappeared students, permitting them to continue in their fight for justice
and against impunity. 
·      
Continue to investigate the events
that occurred in Iguala on 26 – 27 September, establishing with conclusive
scientific proof, the whereabouts of the disappeared students, as well as
establishing the alleged involvement of the authorities at all levels in these
incidents and the chain of command of such authorities.
·      
Facilitate the work of all
independent international experts working on the case 
·      
Guarantee the protection of all
human rights defenders, including through statements of recognition of their
legitimacy, the sanctioning of all aggressions against them, the implementation
of adequate protective measures for victims and the full implementation of the
Law for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders and Journalists.
As it is
public knowledge, in February 2015, the UN Committee on Enforced Disappearances
highlighted the numerous cases and reports it has received which described threats
and attacks against relatives of disappeared persons and human rights defenders
working on this issue. The UN has furthermore highlighted the persistent
climate of violence, hostility and insecurity in which human rights defenders
work in Mexico.
