The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights
Defenders, a partnership of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and FIDH,
requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in India.
 
Brief description of the information:
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources
about the arbitrary arrest and judicial harassment of land rights activist Mr. Akhil Gogoi,
President of Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS), a peasant rights
organisation based in Assam[1]. 
 
According to
the information received, on the evening of September 13, 2017, Mr. Akhil Gogoi was arrested at the office of KMSS in Golaghat, Assam State, by Dibrugarh
police. He was falsely charged with “sedition” (Section 124 (A) of the Indian
Penal Code), “criminal conspiracy” (Section 120-B), “waging or attempting to
wage war against the Government of India” (Section 121), “abetment of an
offence” (Section 109), “causing communal disharmony” (section 153) and “hate
speech” (Section 153-A). 
 
Mr. Akhil Gogoi’s arrest took place the day after he addressed a public audience in Moran, Dibrugarh,
during which he criticised various policy decisions of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) State Government in Assam. These
included infringing the rights of indigenous people of Assam, including the
non-implementation of the 1985 Assam Accord; and the absence of constitutional
safeguards to protect the rights of indigenous people of Assam. After his
speech, the police lodged a First Information Report (FIR) against Mr. Gogoi at
Moran police station, accusing him of “fuelling anti-national activities” (case
number 180/17)[2]. This
complaint formed the basis for Mr. Gogoi’s arrest by Dibrugarh police on
September 13, 2017.
 
Mr. Akhil Gogoi’s arrest also came in the wake of the mass rallies held by
KMSS in past few weeks, protesting against the mishandling by the BJP State
Government of the agrarian farm crisis following a very poor summer harvest.
 
On September 18, 2017, Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate Imdad Ahmed
remanded Mr. Akhil Gogoi in judicial custody until September 25, 2017.
 
On September 25, 2017, Mr. Akhil Gogoi was brought before Dibrugarh
Court and was arrested under the National Security Act in connection with at
least 15 cases pending before various courts, including a case pending against
him in Kaziranga[3]. During
the court hearing, Mr. Akhil Gogoi
was humiliated and physically mistreated. The
Court ultimately rejected his bail application.
 
As of the publication of this Urgent
Appeal, Mr. Akhil
Gogoi remained detained in Dibrugarh
jail, although his transfer to Nagaon jail was announced on September 25,
2017. Moreover, he is kept in solitary confinement and he has been denied
access to a lawyer and to his relatives, which would request the permission
from the District Commissioner.
 
The next hearing in his case is scheduled
to take place on October 10, 2017.
 
The
Observatory strongly condemns the arbitrary arrest of Mr. Akhil Gogoi, which only aims at punishing him
for his legitimate human rights activities, and calls on the Indian authorities
to immediately and unconditionally release him.
 
Actions requested: 
 
Please write to the authorities in India,
urging them to:
 
i.
Guarantee, in all circumstances, the physical and psychological integrity of
Mr. Akhil Gogoi and of all human
rights defenders in India;
 
ii. Release
Mr. Akhil Gogoi immediately
and unconditionally as his detention is arbitrary since it only seems to aim at
punishing him for his human rights activities;
 
iii. Guarantee the access of Mr. Mr.
Akhil Gogoi to his family members and to a lawyer of
his own or his family’s choosing;
 
iv. Put an end to all acts of harassment
- including at the judicial level - against Mr. Akhil Gogoi and all human rights defenders in India,
and ensure in all circumstances that they are able to carry out their
legitimate activities without any hindrance and fear of reprisals;
 
v.
Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders,
adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, in
particular with Articles 1 and 12.2;
 
vi.
Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms
in accordance with international human rights standards and international
instruments ratified by India.

[1] Founded by Mr. Akhil Gogoi in 2005, KMSS works notably
in favour of land rights and since 2009 has also been leading a statewide movement against construction of big dams
in the ecologically sensitive regions of Assam and Arunachal Pradesh.


[2]
The police accuse Mr. Gogoi of
allegedly having said at the public meeting that an armed struggle would have to
be adopted if the rights of the indigenous people were infringed upon by the
BJP-led Government in Assam.


[3] On October 2, 2016, Mr. Gogoi was arrested
for protesting against the eviction of Muslim immigrants from forestland near
Kaziranga National Park. He was released from Golaghat jail only on December
19, 2016 after the Guwahati High Court granted him
bail on December 16. The
case has been pending since then.
