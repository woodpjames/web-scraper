The Observatory for the Protection of
Human Rights Defenders, a partnership of FIDH and the World Organisation
Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent intervention in the following
situation in Egypt.
 
Description of the situation:
 
The
Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the arbitrary detention
of Mr. Haytham Mohamadein, labour lawyer and a member of El-Nadim Centre for the Rehabilitation
of Victims of Violence, an Egyptian NGO dedicated to combating torture and
providing medical and legal aid in support of victims of human rights' abuses.
 
According to the information received, on May 18, 2018, just before
dawn, members of the police and National Security Agency assailed Mr. Haytham
Mohamadein’s home in El Saf in Giza Governorate and arrested him. No warrant
was presented to him. 
 
Mr. Haytham Mohamadein was detained in an unknown location until he
appeared before the Supreme State Security Prosecution in New Cairo's Tagammu
El-Khamis District on May 19, 2018. On this day, the prosecutor ordered a
15-day detention period pending an investigation on charges of "aiding a
terrorist organisation to achieve its goals" and "calling for illegal
protests". These charges stem from the Prosecution’s allegations of Mr. Haytham
Mohamadein’s participation in protests over the rise in metro fares on May 12,
2018, although he did not take part in the protests. 
 
On May 19, 2018, Mr. Haytham Mohamadein was transferred to the Central
Security Forces Camp "Kilo 10.5", which is located on the
Cairo-Alexandria desert road.
 
The Observatory recalls that this is not the first time Mr. Haytham
Mohamadein is targeted by the Egyptian authorities for his legitimate and
peaceful human rights activities as he was detained on at least two different
occasions in the past, the latter from April to October 2016, on charges of "joining
a banned group, participating in an illegal protest and plotting the overthrow
of the ruling government".
 
Thus, the Observatory urges the Egyptian authorities to immediately and
unconditionally release Mr. Haytham Mohamadein as his detention is arbitrary
and only aims at silencing his human rights work. Indeed, Mr. Haytham
Mohamadein’s arrest and detention occur in a wider trend of harassment and
arbitrary detentions against human rights defenders in Egypt, where authorities
have been cracking down on nearly all independent human rights organisations.
Since the beginning of 2018, the Observatory has documented the arbitrary
detention of several human rights defenders, including of Ms. Amal Fathy on May 11, 2018[1].
 
The Observatory further urges the Egyptian authorities to put an end to
all forms of harassment against Mr. Haytham Mohamadein and to ensure human
rights defenders in Egypt are able to carry out their legitimate and peaceful
human rights work without fear of hindrance or reprisals.
 
Actions requested:
 
Please
write to the authorities of Egypt asking them to:
 
i.       
Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and
psychological integrity of Mr. Haytham Mohamadein, and all human rights defenders in Egypt;
 
ii.    Immediately and
unconditionally release Mr. Haytham Mohamadein as his detention is arbitrary and merely
aimed at punishing him for his human rights activities;
 
iii.    Put an end to all acts
of harassment, including at the judicial level, Mr.
Haytham Mohamadein and all human rights
defenders in Egypt, and ensure that they are able to carry out their
activities without hindrance or fear of reprisals; 

iv.    Conform with the
provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the
General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially Articles
1, 6(c) and 12.2; and
 
v.    More generally, ensure
in all circumstances the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in
accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with
international and regional human rights instruments ratified by Egypt.
