New information: The Observatory has been informed by the Human Rights Association (İnsan Haklari Derneği - İHD) about recent acts of harassment against Mr. Ethem Açıkalın, President of the Adana branch of the İHD. According to the information received, on March 10, 2009, the home of Mr. Ethem Açıkalın was raided by plain clothes policemen working with the Anti-Terror Unit of the Police Forces, who were in possession of a search warrant and a detention order against him. However, Mr. Ethem Açıkalın was not arrested as he was outside his home at that moment. The terms of the detention order remain unknown. This act of harassment comes in a context where İHD has been issuing public reactions on cases of violations of the most fundamental rights of children. The Observatory is concerned about the ongoing harassment against Mr. Ethem Açıkalın, and recalls that the latter has been a privileged target of the authorities since the beginning of 2008 (see background information). Accordingly, the Observatory calls upon Turkish authorities to cancel the detention order against Mr. Ethem Açıkalın in the absence of any valid ground for such detention, and to put an end to all kinds of harassment against him, İHD members, and other human rights defenders in Turkey, in accordance with the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly on December 9, 1998. The Observatory urges the Turkish authorities to also comply with the Declaration of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe on Human Rights Defenders, so as to “create an environment conductive to human rights defenders, to take effective measures to protect, promote, and respect them, to ensure their access to effective remedies, to take action to prevent attacks and harassment against them”. The Observatory further recalls that as a Participating State of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), Turkey acknowledges that “the [...] UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders [... places] a responsibility [...] on states to adopt and implement adequate legislation and administrative procedures that would provide for a conducive environment for human rights defenders to promote and strive for the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, and recognises “the need for particular attention, support and protection for human rights defenders by the OSCE, its Institutions and field operations, as well as by participating States”[1]. Background information On January 23, 2008, Mr. Ethem Açıkalın was arrested in Adana and accused of “being a member of an illegal organisation” (Article 314 of the Criminal Code, referring to Article 220/6 of the Criminal Code in Turkish Law n° 5237) and “propaganda for an illegal organisation” (Article 7/2 of Anti-Terror Law n° 3713). These charges are linked to Mr. Açıkalın’s participation in a press conference organised on December 17, 2007 by the Adana Front for Rights and Freedoms (Adana Haklar ve Özgürlükler Cephesi) in order to denounce the assassination, probably by the police, on December 10, 2007, in Ankara, of Ms. Kevser Mızrak, supposed to be a member of the Revolutionary People’s Liberation Party (Devrimci Halk Kurtulus Partisi - Cephesi - DHKP-C). During the press conference, a document denouncing extrajudicial executions and calling on the police forces to prevent such human rights violations had been read out. Accused of being a member of DHKP-C, Mr. Açıkalın might be sentenced to imprisonment ranging from 7,5 to 15 years. After being detained in the F-type prison[2] in Adana, with six opponents also arrested on January 23, 2008, Mr. Açıkalın was released on June 23, 2008, pending a hearing, rescheduled for March 25, 2009, before the 8th Heavy Penal Court in Adana.
