New information:  The Observatory has been informed that Mr. Sergei Duvanov, chief  editor of the news bulletin "Human Rights in Kazakhstan and in the  world" published by the Kazakhstan-based International Bureau for  Human Rights and the Rule of Law (KIBHRL), was sentenced on March 11,  2003, on appeal, to three years and a half in prison, for the alleged  rape of a minor.  Mr Duvanov was arrested on October 28, 2002, on the day he was  scheduled to depart for the United States to discuss the situation of  human rights and democracy in Kazakhstan. On October 29, he began a hunger strike, but was obliged to break it  off shortly afterwards due to ill health. On November 6, 2002, he was  formally charged with raping a minor.  The trial began on December 2, and on January 28, 2003, Karasai  district court found Mr Duvanov guilty under Article 120, part 2,  paragraph D of the Criminal Code (rape of a minor with prior  knowledge of the age), sentencing him to three years and a half in  prison. Acording to Duvanov's lawyers, numerous procedural violations  were registered during the trial, which should have lead to the  dismissal of the case. Several days before the verdict, Duvanov  dismissed his lawyers, citing the obvious lack of independance of  judges, in particular the President who seemed to have made the  decision long before the announcement of the sentence.  During the appeal case, international observers who had asked  permission to attend the hearing were denied admittance at the time  that the verdict was rendered.  The Observatory recalls that the European Parliament passed a  resolution on February 13, 2003, demanded Duvanov's immediate release  and voiced deep concern about the investigation, prosecution and  sentence. The Organization for Security and Cooperation (OSCE) on  January 28,  2003, also criticized the legal irregularities and lack  of evidence supporting the charges and urged the appeal court to take  account of these shortcomings when it considered the case.  In view of past acts of repression against Sergei Duvanov and the  numerous irregularities during his trial, the Observatory considers  Mr Duvanov's detention to be arbitrary, since it only aims at  sanctioning his activities in favour of human rights and democracy in  Kazakhstan.  Background information:  Mr Duvanov had already been the victim of numerous acts of  intimidation, such as physical assault in August 2002, shortly before  he was intending to travel to Warsaw to attend the OSCE's annual  human rights conference where he had to intervene on the situation of  human rights in Kazakhstan. In July 2002, legal proceedings were  brought against him for articles written "infringing the honour and  dignity of the President". At the same time, his apartment and his  office were searched by investigators and his computers and numerous  papers were confiscated  Actions requested:  Please write to the Kazakh authorities urging them to:  i.   Immediately release Mr Duvanov due to the arbitrariness of his  detention;  ii.  Put an end to all forms of harassment and violence against Human  Rights Defenders and ensure the implementation of the provisions of  the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders adopted by the UN general  Assembly on December 9, 1998, in particular its article 1, which  provides that "everyone has the right, individually and in  association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection  and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the  national and international levels" and article 6. b: "everyone has  the right individually and in association with others, freely to  publish, impart or disseminate to others views, information and  knowledge on all human rights and fundamental freedoms";  iii. Guarantee the respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms  in accordance with the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and  other international instruments ratified by Kazakhstan.
