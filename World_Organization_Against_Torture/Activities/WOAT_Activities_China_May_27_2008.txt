Brief description of the situation The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by The Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy (TCHRD), member of OMCT SOS-Torture network, about the violent arrest of two nuns from Dargay Hardu Nunnery, namely Ven. Jampa Lhamo (30 years old from Sadul Village) and Ven. Rinzin Wangdon (23 years old from Lharinyan Village), located in Kardze County, Kardze “Tibet Autonomous Prefecture”, Sichuan Province. According to the information received, on 23 May 2008, Ven. Jampa Lhamo and Ven. Rinzin Wangdon staged a peaceful protest at the Kardze County Government headquarters and chanted slogans calling for the “swift return of the Dalai Lama to Tibet”, “long live the Dalai Lama”, “freedom for Tibet” and “immediate release of all political prisoners”. The two nuns were then allegedly severely beaten by a group of Public Security Bureau (PSB) officials in situ before being taken to Kardze County PSB Detention Centre reportedly for further questioning. There is currently no information as to their conditions of detention. The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned for the safety of Ven. Jampa Lhamo and Ven. Rinzin Wangdon, who, according to the information received, were arrested and detained solely for peacefully exercising their rights to freedom of expression, association and assembly. OMCT fears that they may be subject to torture and ill-treatment. OMCT recalls that China is a State party to the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment which prohibits torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. OMCT urges the authorities to conform with China’s international human rights obligations, commitments that were reaffirmed on the occasion of its election as a member of the new United Nations Human Rights Council. Actions Requested Please write to the authorities in the People’s Republic of China urging them to:   Guarantee, in all circumstances, the physical and psychological integrity of Ven. Jampa Lhamo and Ven. Rinzin Wangdon;  Guarantee immediate and unconditional access to legal representation, their families and any medical treatment they may require;  Order their immediate release in the absence of valid legal charges, or, if such charges exist, bring them before an impartial, independent, competent and fair tribunal and guarantee their procedural rights at all times;  Order a thorough and impartial investigation into these events in order to identify all those responsible, bring them to trial and apply the penal and/or administrative sanctions as provided by law;  Guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
