Excellencies,

We, the undersigned non-governmental organizations, write to voice our support
for the joint statement on the human rights situation in Bahrain delivered by
Switzerland at the 30th Session of the Human Rights Council (HRC). 
 
Since
the last joint statement on Bahrain in June 2014, the government has continued
to curtail the rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful
assembly. Human rights defenders, political opposition leaders, members of the
media, and youth have faced intimidation, arrest, arbitrary detention, unfair
trials and acts of reprisal by the authorities. Furthermore, negotiations of
the Office of the High Commissioner for human Rights’ (OHCHR) for a program of
technical capacity building in Bahrain have stalled in the period since the
June 2014 joint statement.
 
We
urge your government, therefore, to sign the joint statement on Bahrain
delivered by Switzerland at the HRC’s 30th session in order to refocus international
attention on human rights in Bahrain and encourage the government of Bahrain to
constructively address its ongoing violations.
 
International
pressure on Bahrain continues to assist in addressing human rights violations
in Bahrain, as reflected by the decision of the King of Bahrain to release prominent
human rights defender Nabeel Rajab under a royal pardon after he spent over four
months in prison for a tweet criticizing the government. 
 
It
is critical, therefore, to take action now to reaffirm the high level of
international concern over human rights conditions in Bahrain. To abandon
collective pressure on Bahrain at a time when the situation is continuing to
deteriorate would send an entirely wrong message to the Bahraini government,
and undermine both internal and external efforts to foster genuine reform. 
 
Switzerland
has indicated that this joint statement will be open for additional signatories
throughout the session. We therefore call on your government to recommit to
supporting human rights in Bahrain, and to add your endorsement to this joint
statement.
 
Sincerely,
