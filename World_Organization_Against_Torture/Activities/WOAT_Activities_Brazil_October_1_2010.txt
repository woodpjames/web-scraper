Today, there is no
doubt that torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment
or punishment and other forms of violence – including violence against
women and children – are related in many ways to disrespect for economic, social
and cultural rights. If, therefore, these phenomena are to be effectively
eliminated, then their economic, social and cultural root causes must, first,
be understood and, secondly, effectively addressed. The converse equally
applies: acting to reduce levels of violence in a given society is a
fundamental step towards ensuring the widespread enjoyment of economic, social and
cultural rights. As Louise Arbour, the former UN High Commissioner for
Human Rights observed in her preface to the OMCT study on this theme,
the question of “how to prevent or reduce violence, including torture, by
acting on its root causes, often found in violations of economic, social and
cultural rights”, is one that, “goes to the very heart of human rights
protection”.
How the denial of
economic, social and cultural rights is related to torture and other
forms of violenceThe poor, excluded
and other vulnerable groups are often the first and most
numerous victims of violence, including torture and cruel, inhuman
and degrading treatment.Levels of violence in
a given community or society can be such that individuals or
groups are unable to enjoy their economic, social and cultural
rights.Violence is inflicted
on persons because they demand respect for economic, social
or cultural rights – their own or those of others.Policies and
programmes by governments, private actors or development and financial
institutions can exacerbate poverty and inequalities and
lead to increased levels of official, criminal and domestic
violence.
This report, prepared
by Justiça Global, the National Movement of Street Boys and
Girls (Movimento Nacional de Meninos e Meninas de Rua – MNMMR) and the
World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) is not intended to
offer an exhaustive appraisal of the denial of economic, social and cultural
rights in Brazil. Rather, it addresses some of the key areas where there is a
clear and direct link between violations of economic, social and cultural rights
and violence, or the threat of violence in this country. An important element
of this report is the recommendations it contains for the Government of
Brazil to address the economic, social and cultural root causes of torture and
other forms of violence.
