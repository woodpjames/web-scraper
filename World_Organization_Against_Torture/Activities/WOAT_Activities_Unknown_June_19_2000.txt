Mr. Al Alami was visited by a lawyer from LAW on 13 June 2000.  According to the information received, Mr. Al Alami was summoned for an interview by the Palestinian General Intelligence (GIA) at the Ramallah & Al Bireh Governor’s Headquarters.  He waited at that location for two hours without being interviewed and then was taken to prison without being informed of any charges against him.  Mr. Al Alami’s jailors told him that his arrest had been ordered by President Arafat and that the order was signed by the Chief of Police, General Ghazi Al Jabali.  The order simply stated that Mr. Al Alami had « broken the law » without offering any other explanation of the charge.  The duration of Mr. Al Alami’s detention was said to be unlimited.  In the interview with the LAW lawyer, Mr. Al Alami said that he had been told to remain silent and had been forced to sign a bond guaranteeing his silence.   According to the information received, Mr. Al Alami’s family has been allowed to visit and he has had access to medical treatment.  Mr. Al Alami suffers from a heart condition that requires continuous treatment.    It was reported that Mr. Al Alami took part in a television talk show, broadcast on Al QUDS Educational Television, on 31 May 2000.  The show discussed the PNA’s policy of shutting down local TV and radio stations, such as Al Nasr TV and Radio Al Manara.  It was also reported that Mr. Al Alami was interrogated about his opinions published in the Al Istiqlal newspaper.  The International Secretariat is gravely concerned about the arrest of Maher Al Alami and the recurrent arbitrary arrests of journalists, intellectuals and politicians for practicing their right to freedom of speech.  OMCT is also concerned about the repeated closures of local TV and radio stations for the same reason.        Action requested:  Please write to the authorities in Palestine Autonomous Areas urging them to:  i.	take all necessary measures to guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Maher Abdul Majeed Al Alami and order his immediate release in absence of valid legal charges ;  ii.	order a thorough and impartial investigation into this situation in order to bring those responsible to trial and apply the penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions provided by law;  iii.	guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
