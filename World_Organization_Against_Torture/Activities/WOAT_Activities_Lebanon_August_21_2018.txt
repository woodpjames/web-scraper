Threat of judicial harassment /
Restrictions to freedom of expression
Lebanon
August 21, 2018
 
The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights
Defenders, a partnership of FIDH and the World Organisation Against Torture
(OMCT), requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in Lebanon.
 
Description of the situation:
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable
sources about the threat of judicial harassment faced by Mr. Wadih al-Asmar,
President of EuroMed Rights and of the Lebanese Center for Human Rights (CLDH)[1].

 
According to the information received, Mr.
Wadih al-Asmar received, on August 16, 2018, a WhatsApp call from the
Cybercrime Bureau, requesting him for questionning regarding posts published on
his Facebook and Twitter accounts. No further details were given on the
specific content of the posts to Mr. Wadih al-Asmar. The Cybercrime Bureau
summoned him to interrogation on August 31, 2018. 
 
In recent weeks, summons by the authorities
for writings criticizing politicians or mocking religious symbols on social
medias have multiplied. On July 24, 2018, hundreds of citizens gathered on
Samir Kassir Square to peacefully protest against repression and decline of
freedom of expression in Lebanon.
 
In such context, the Observatory fears that
Mr. Wadih al-Asmar may have been summoned in relation to his human rights
activities, and calls the Lebanese authorities to refrain from any charges
against him as well as against all human rights defenders, should they aim at
sanctionning the legitimate exercice of freedom of opinion and expression. 
 
Actions requested:
 
Please write to the authorities in Lebanon,
urging them to:
 
i.     
Put an end to any act of harassment,
including at the judicial level, against Mr. Wadih al-Asmar, and more generally
against all human rights defenders in Lebanon;
ii.    
Guarantee
in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Wadih
al-Asmar, and respect his right to a fair trial ; 
iii.  
Conform
with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by
the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its
articles 1, 6 (b) and (c), and 12; as well as of the International Convenant on
Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), especially its article 19; 
iv.   
More
generally, ensure in all circumstances the respect for human rights and
fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards
and international instruments ratified by Lebanon.
