Brief description of the situation  On May 29th  2000, M. Georges Kazimbika, in charge of the finances of  the Collectif National des ONG du Développement (CNONG/development) was questioned by agents of the Agence Nationale des Renseignements (ANR) on the pretext that his name was  founds in the diary of a woman presumed to be connected with the  rebels.   According to information Georges Kazimbika was arrested because  the members of the ANR were unable to get hold of the man in charge of  the CNONG/Development. Having been warned of the arrival yesterday in Kinshasa of Felicien Malanda, executive secretary of the CNONGD/Development, the agents of the ANR arrested him at his office  on Friday June 2nd at 13 : 00  hours.   According to information received M. Georges Kazimbika and Felicien  Malanda cannot have any visitors, not even a lawyer, and the food  parcels brought by their families are rejected.
