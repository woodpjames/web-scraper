Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel (PCATI), a member of the OMCT network, of the arbitrary arrest and incommunicado detention of Mr. Saadi Ibrahim Abed Elashi, in Israel.  According to the information received, on May 20th, 2001, 42 year-old Mr. Saadi Ibrahim Abed Elashi, a resident of Gaza, was arbitrarily arrested by Israeli border guards at the Kfar Darom checkpoint. He has been detained incommunicado since then in the GSS Interrogation Unit at the Shikma Detention Center in Ashkelon. On May 23rd Mr. Elashi's attorney was informed by GSS Attorney Shai Nitzan than an Order Prohibiting Meeting with Counsel (OPMC) had been imposed against Mr. Elashi, lasting until May 29th.  On May 23rd, PCATI filed an urgent appeal, through its attorney Nael Zahalke, with the High Court of Justice, demanding that the OPMC be lifted and that Mr. Elashi be allowed to meet with his lawyer. PCATI also demanded that Mr. Elashi be informed that he is being represented by an attorney, and that action is being taken on his behalf. On May 24th the High Court of Justice rejected the appeal during a hearing. The conditions of Mr. Elashi's arrest and subsequent detention in Askelon prison's interrogation unit are a blatant violation of his rights, including his right to access to legal representation.   OMCT is gravely concerned for Mr. Elashi's physical and psychological integrity, and condemns the GSS' systematic use of arbitrary arrests, incommunicado detentions. OMCT fears that Mr. Elashi may be being tortured, as the OPMC and incommunicado detentions are reportedly sometimes used by the GSS as cover for violations of this type.   Action requested  Please write to the authorities in Israel urging them to:  -	take all necessary measures to guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Elashi; -	order his immediate release in the absence of valid legal charges or, if such charges exist, bring him before an impartial and competent tribunal and guarantee his procedural rights at all times; -	order a thorough and impartial investigation into the circumstances of his arrest  in order to identify those responsible, bring them to trial and apply the penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions as provided by law; -	intervene with the appropriate authorities in order to secure that allow Mr. Elashi be allowed to meet with his lawyer; -	guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
