The International Secretariat of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) requires your urgent intervention in the following situation in Sri Lanka. Brief description of the situation: The International Secretariat of OMCT was informed by a reliable source and Antenna International, a member of SOS-Torture network, of the abduction and killing of Mr. Karthakesu Chandramohan (26) and Mr. Sinnarasa Shanmugalingam (32), two volunteers of the Sri Lanka Red Cross (SLRC), based in Batticaloa. According to the information received, at approximately 6:45 am on 1 June 2007, six employees of the SLRC, among whom Mr. Karthakesu Chandramohan and Mr. Sinnarasa Shanmugalingam, gathered at platform 4 at the Colombo Fort Railway Station in order to return to Batticaloa after attending a five-day workshop in the city of Mount Lavinia. They were then approached by four to five men dressed in civilian clothing who asked them for their National Identity Cards (NIC).The SLCR employees were interrogated at the platform collectively and individually in Sinhala - allegedly the only language the interrogators could speak fluently. It is reported that interrogators asserted being from the Criminal Investigation Department (CID). They asked only Mr. Chandramohan and Mr. Shanmugalingam to accompany them to the police station, on the grounds that they needed more information on them both. One of the other colleagues volunteered to translate for them from Tamil to Sinhala since the two victims were not able of holding a conversation in the latter, to which proposition the interrogators agreed. They then boarded their vehicle, and as their co-worker was about to get in, the vehicle took off. However, he managed to take the registration number (No. 252 - 6432) of the tinted-windows-white van, as described by him. He subsequently met up with his other colleagues and called the head of SLRC in Colombo. On 2 June 2007, the bodies of Messrs. Karthakesu Chandramohan and Sinnarasa Shanmugalingam were found in Kiriella near the central town of Ratnapura, 60 miles (40 Km) south east of Colombo. They were identified at the Ratnapura Base Hospital. Further investigations have shown that they died from gun shot injuries. Actions requested: Please write to the authorities in Sri Lanka urging them to:  Order a thorough and impartial investigation into the abduction and subsequent assassination assassination of Mr. Karthakesu Chandramohan and Mr. Sinnarasa Shanmugalingam, in order to identify all those responsible, bring them before a civil competent and impartial tribunal and apply to them the penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions provided by the law; Guarantee that adequate reparation is provided to their families; Guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
