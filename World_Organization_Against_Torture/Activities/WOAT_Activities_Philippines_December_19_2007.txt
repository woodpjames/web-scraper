Casoon, Monkayo in Compostela Valley, on 12 December 2007, by alleged elements of the Scout Rangers, in Purok 4. According to the information received, on 12 December 2007, at around 7:00 am, Mr. Renante Rumagos was walking towards his farm to make charcoal and harvest bananas, when he was reportedly called by alleged members of the Scout Rangers who were concealing themselves in an elevated area. As Mr. Renante Rumagos approached, one of the soldiers reportedly blindfolded him and covered his mouth. He had also reportedly his hands tied up behind his back.
