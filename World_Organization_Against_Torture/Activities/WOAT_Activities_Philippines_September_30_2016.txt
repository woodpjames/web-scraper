Geneva, 30 September 2016 – Max de Mesa, a leading
anti-torture activist in the Philippines and a member of the World Organisation
Against Torture’s General Assembly, passed away on Wednesday. OMCT’s SOS
Torture network will miss him terribly, as his country faces challenging times
in the protection of human rights.
 
Max was an inspiration to many of us, a
gifted individual who shaped the fight against torture and for justice in his
country including in OMCT's two member organizations, the Philippine Alliance of
Human Rights Advocates (PAHRA) and the Task Force Detainees of the
Philippines (TFDP),
providing fundamental support to victims of torture.
 
We will always remember his commitment to
fight torture and his solidarity in advocating the release of fellow human
rights defenders, including through a mission we undertook together to
Bangladesh in 2013. 
 
Max used to speak not only in the name of
his own country, but of the whole region. He always offered pertinent advice
and his unwavering friendship, and we were looking forward to seeing him again
at our upcoming General Assembly meeting and 30th anniversary
celebration on 24–25 November. 
 
Our thoughts go to his family, and also to
our friends, partners and colleagues in the Philippines.
