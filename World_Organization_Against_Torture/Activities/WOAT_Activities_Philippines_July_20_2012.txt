The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of
the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and the International Federation
for Human Rights (FIDH), requests your urgent intervention
in the following situation in The
Philippines.
 
Brief
description of the situation:
 
The Observatory has been informed by
Task Force Detainees of the Philippines (TFDP) of the killing of Mr. Moises C. Fuentes, a human rights
defender from Maramag, Bukidnon. The victim is a member of the Bukindon chapter
of Human Rights Defenders Pilipinas. Since 1999, he was also a
local leader of the farmers’ organisation Kuya Christian Farmers Association,
in Barangay Kuya, Maramag, Bukidnon. His organisation, along with other
farmers' groups, has been struggling to keep the land they till, which is
located within the area controlled by the Ocaya cattle ranch in Bukidnon, and
later granted to them in 2011 under a government land reform programme (see
background information).
 
According to
the information received, on June 16, 2012, Mr. Fuentes was gunned down by an
unknown assailant at his residence in Barangay Kuya, Maramag, Bukidnon at about
1 p.m. in the afternoon. He was shot in front of his wife and died on the spot.

 
Background information:
 
A few months
before Mr. Fuentes' killing in June 2012, a message had reportedly been read on
a local radio station in Maramag, Bukidnon, listing the names of persons to be
killed. The list contained the names of leaders of farmers’ groups, including
the Kuya Christian Farmers Association that had successfully petitioned the
government to place the Ocaya ranch under the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform
Program (CARP), a state policy that allows the government to acquire and
redistribute farmland. 
 
The farmers’
groups have been struggling for three decades to secure entitlement to the land
they have been farming on, which is located in a former forest area
subsequently converted into a ranch and occupied by the powerful Ocaya family.
The land was originally leased in 1986 to a company represented by the late
Bukidnon Governor Timoteo Ocaya, under a Forest Land Grazing Lease Lease
Agreement (FLGLA), but the Department of Environment and Natural Resources
(DENR) cancelled the agreement in 2008 after discovering violations of the
terms. 
 
In
2007-2009, several people’s organisations also applied for Community Based
Approach Forest Management (CBFM) in the area, which led the DENR to publish
detailed maps of the entire area controlled by the Ocaya ranch. After
discovering that almost ninety hectares of the area were already available as
Alienable and Disposal, people’s organisations, including the Kuya Christian
Farmers Association, filed a petition with the office of the Department of
Agrarian Reform (DAR).
 
On February
22, 2010, DAR distributed fifty hectares out of the 820-hectare Ocaya ranch to
the farmers and representatives of five people’s organisations, including the
Kuya Christian Farmers Association which was awarded a total of 9.8 hectares..
In May 2010, however, these farmers were forced to leave the area awarded to
them after reportedly being harassed by armed guards of the ranch. In December
2011, these farmers were re-installed in the area by the Provincial Agrarian
Reform Officer (PARO) of the DAR.
