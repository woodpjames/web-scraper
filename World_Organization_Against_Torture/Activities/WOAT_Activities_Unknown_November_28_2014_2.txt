The World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), the principal global civil society coalition against torture, is launching its Campaign “10 days of Activism against Torture and Ill-Treatment” for the third year in a row.On the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the UN Convention against Torture, the OMCT is going to present during ten days human rights defenders from different parts of the world who are committed to making a difference in the fight against torture.“The struggle against torture can only succeed thanks to the courageous advocates who work on the implementation of the Torture Convention”, recalled Gerald Staberock, OMCT Secretary General.Each day, OMCT is showing a video featuring one human rights defender responding to a question in relation to torture and impunity. Each of them discusses from a different perspective the importance of the Convention against Torture and its implementation in their respective country.Human rights defenders are the voices of those who are deprived of it. However, those who courageously defend human rights may risk threats, harassment, arbitrary arrest and detention, torture or enforced disappearance. At a time when defenders around the world are stigmatized or threatened because of their work these videos remind us of the essential role of human rights defenders in the fight against torture.The videos will be available each day on the OMCT’s website as well as on its social media (Facebook, Twitter, Youtube).You can already watch the teaser of the Campaign: http://youtu.be/U0sL1HVIJJg For further information, please contact:Marina Gente, +41(0) 22 809 49 39, mg@omct.org* * *This Campaign is realised with the financial support of the Swiss Confederation and the European Union.
