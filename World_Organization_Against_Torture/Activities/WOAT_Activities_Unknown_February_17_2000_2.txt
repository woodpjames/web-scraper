According to the information received, a number of prisoners in Palestinian State Security Forces' prisons are still being held despite decisions issued by the High Court of Justice to release them.   The prisoners are:     1. Ameen Shafieq Diab – the Court decision to release him was issued 10 June 1999, and he is still being held in the Central Gaza Prison.    2.
