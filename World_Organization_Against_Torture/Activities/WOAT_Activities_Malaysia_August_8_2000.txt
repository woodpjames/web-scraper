New Information  The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned by the sentencing of Anwar Ibrahim, deputy prime minister, to 9 years jail for sodomy.  This sentence is to be added to a previous sentence of 6 years for alleged misuse of power.  Anwar’s foster brother, Sukma Dermawan, also charged with sodomy, was sentenced to six years in jail and four strokes of rotan.  According to Aliran, a member of the OMCT network, it seems that the so-called victim had admitted on three occasions in an earlier trial that he was not sodomised and there was no corroborating evidence to sustain the allegation (see below).  Furthermore, a crowd of around a thousand people had reportedly gathered in support around the HongKong & ShangHai Bank building (at the banks of the river facing the High Court), in spite of the arrest of 7 people a few days ago. (See Cases MYS 040800/1)  OMCT was informed that the crowd was waiting patiently for Wan Azizah (Anwar Ibrahim’s wife) to address them.    At 9:30 am, Tian Chuan and Abdul Malek Hussein were arrested.  Both were previously arrested during a demonstration following the sentencing of Mr Anwar Ibrahim for corruption on 14th April 1999. (Case MYS 230998.6)  At around 12.30pm., the police and FRU moved in to disperse the crowd.  It was estimated that more than 10 people were arrested at that point. Witnesses reported that 2 of the arrested persons, Mona Suffian (previously arrested on 4th August 2000 – See Case MYS 040800/1) and Sabran were beaten by the police during their arrest.  Others arrested are Mat Jasni b. Rosli, Norsuria b. Ismail, Monas Suffian Putra b. Zulkarnain, Sabran b. Hamzah, Mohd. Jasni Zakaria, Nekmat b. Abu, Amran.  Another 4 women were also reportedly arrested.   The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned over the deterioration of the human rights situation in Malaysia.  Brief reminder of the situation  The International Secretariat was informed by a reliable source of the arrest, on September 20th 1998, of twelve persons (including Mr Anwar Ibrahim) under the Internal Security Act (ISA) which allows for indefinite detention without trial.  Also, Dr Wan Azizah, the wife of Mr Anwar Ibrahim was the object of intense harassment and intimidation.  On 14th April 1999, the High Court in Kuala Lumpur found Mr Ibrahim guilty of corruption and sentenced him to 6 years imprisonment.  Many sources, including Param Cumaraswamy, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Independence of Judges and Lawyers expressed concerns over the fairness of the trial.  On 5th October 1999, OMCT reported that Mr Ibrahim was subjected to ill-treatment while in custody.  He was accused of corruption and of having homosexual relationship with Dr Ahmad Anees.  Dr Ahmad Anees was held in Kuala Lumpur’s Bukat Aman prison.  It was alleged that Dr Ahmad Anees confessed under torture to being sodomized by Mr Ibrahim.  During Mr Ibrahim’s trial, which began on 2nd November 1998, he accused the police of beating him.   Dr Ahmad Anees was released on 26th March 1999.  Action requested  Please write to the authorities in Malaysia urging them to:  i.	take all necessary measures to guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of Mr Anwar Ibrahim and all those taking part in demonstrations on his behalf.   ii.	order the immediate release of those persons arrested in the absence of valid legal charges or, if such charges exist, bring them before an impartial and competent tribunal and guarantee their procedural rights at all times; iii.	put an end to the use of excessive force with regards to those persons exercising their right to freedom of opinion; iv.	guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
