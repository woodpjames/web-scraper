New information: The Observatory has been informed by “Chinese Human Rights Defenders” (CRD) about the deterioration of the health of Mr. Zhang Jianhong, alias Li Hong, founder and editor-in-chief of the website The Aegean Sea (Aiqinhai), which was closed down in March 2006, and a member of the independent writers’ association PEN, who is arbitrarily detained since September 2006 (See background information). According to the information received, Mr. Zhang, who was diagnosed in late May 2007 with a form of muscular dystrophy that could lead to paralysis and even death, did not receive any medical treatment until October 20, 2007. In addition, despite his family’s repeated calls for his release for medical treatment, the authorities have denied his application for release. Likewise, Mr. Zhang has written to the Zhejiang Province Prison Management Bureau, as well as to the Zhejiang Qiaosi Prison and the Zhejiang Prison General Hospital to request release for medical treatment but has received no response. The Observatory expresses its deep concern about Mr. Zhang Jianhong’s physical and psychological integrity, and urges the Chinese authorities to release him immediately and unconditionally since his detention is arbitrary as it merely aims at sanctioning his human rights activities. Background information: On September 6, 2006, Mr. Zhang Jianhong was arrested in his home in Nigbo, Zhejiang province, and detained for “incitement to subvert State power”. The policemen produced a search warrant and seized the hard drives of two of his computers and an address book. They also interrogated his wife on her husband’s acquaintances and the articles calling for democratic reforms that he was posting on websites based abroad. More specifically, in these online articles, Mr. Zhang criticised the human rights abuses of the Chinese government against dissidents, journalists and other Chinese citizens in the run-up to the Olympic Games[1]. His family was officially informed of his arrest on October 12, 2006. On March 19, 2007, Mr. Zhang was sentenced to six years in prison for “inciting the subversion of state power” by the Intermediate Court of Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province. On June 24, 2007, after Mr. Zhang was examined at the Medical Centre of Huzhou City, Zhejiang Province, which issued a letter evaluating Mr. Zhang’s condition and his need for release for medical treatment, he was transferred from Changhu Prison (Zhejiang Province) to Ningbo City Detention Centre in Zhejiang. Since then, Mr. Zhang has been transferred from Ningbo City Detention Centre to Qiaosi Prison in Zhejiang. In a letter to his family, Mr. Zhang said that after his transfer from Ningbo, he had not received proper treatment for three months and in consequence his condition worsened. During this period, he was also denied other rights, including access to his family. Actions requested: Please write to the authorities in the People’s Republic of China, urging them to:  Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Zhang Jianhong, alias Li Hong; Ensure his immediate release since his detention is arbitrary as it merely aims at sanctioning his human rights activities; Guarantee unconditional access to any medical treatment he may require; Put an end to the harassment against all human rights defenders in the People’s Republic of China; Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, and Article 12.2, which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration; Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by the People’s Republic of China.
