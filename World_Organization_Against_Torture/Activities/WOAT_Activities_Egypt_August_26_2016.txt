The Observatory for the Protection of
Human Rights Defenders, a partnership of FIDH and the World
Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), has received new information and requests
your urgent intervention in the following situation in
Egypt.
 
New information: 
 
The
Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the Court's decision to release Mr. Malek Adly, a human rights lawyer
working for the Egyptian Centre for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and
co-funder of the Front of Defence for Egyptian Protesters (FDEP) who has been detained without
formal charges and in solitary confinement in Mazraah Prison in Torah since May
5, 2016. 
According
to the information received, on August 25, 2016, the South Benha Criminal Court
ordered the release without bail of Mr. Malek Adly, pending the outcome of
investigations. The prosecution appealed the court's decision and a review
session is set for August 27, 2016. Meanwhile, Mr. Malek Adly will remain in
prison until the final decision. 
 
The Observatory welcomes the
decision to release Malek Adly and requests the judicial authorities to uphold
the decision and immediately and unconditionally release Mr. Malek Adly.
 
The Observatory further urges the
authorities to drop all the charges against him and stop his harassment as it
only seems to merely aim at sanctioning his legitimate human rights activities.

 
Until Mr. Malek Adly is released, the Observatory further urges the
authorities to ensure that the proceedings and his conditions of detention are
in compliance with international law standards.
 
Background information:
 
On May 5, 2016, Mr. Malek Adly was
arrested by the Egyptian Security Forces in Maadi, Cairo based on an arrest
warrant issued on April 23, 2016. The arrest warrant related to a call to
protest on April 25, 2016, condemning the recent government decision to
transfer the sovereignty of two Red Sea islands to Saudi Arabia (Tiran and
Sanafir) and against President Al Sissi's policies, human rights abuses and
crimes committed by the Egyptian security forces. On April 11, 2016, Mr. Malek
Adly had also filed a lawsuit against such government’s decision on the
islands.
 
Mr. Malek Adly was brought to Maadi
police station and questioned. During his interrogation, he was beaten, struck
with firearms, blindfolded and stripped of his shirt by police officers. He was
then transferred to the Shubra Al-Khaimah public prosecution where he was
questioned again for four hours from 3 am to 7 am. 
 
On May 6, 2016, the prosecutor
ordered his detention for 15 days, pending investigation on several charges,
including of “joining a group to obstruct the law”, “spreading false news”,
“plotting to overthrow the government and alter the Egyptian Constitution”,
“hindering the official duties of government institutions”, “promoting
publications that disrupt national unity”, “inciting the anti-government
protests that took place on April 25” and “using violence and force against
national security agency officers”. The detention was extended several times
until August 25, 2016.
 
On June 28, 2016, the ECESR filed a
complaint against the Minister of Interior, Public Prosecutor, Head of Egypt's
Prison Authority and Officer of Mazraah Prison in Torah regarding Mr. Malek
Adly’s poor detention conditions. Mr. Haitham Al-Harir, a member of Parliament,
also filed several complaints to the Ministry of Interior regarding his conditions
of detention. The latest was filed on July 14.
 
On July 18, 2016, Mr. Malek Adly’s
lawyers requested the court to appoint an investigative judge for the case,
arguing that the prosecution had committed several violations of the right to
due process and fair trial. More particularly, Mr. Malek Adly’s lawyers
complained that they had not received a formal copy of the court's case, that
the court had refused to open an investigation for allegations of torture and
ill treatment during his detention, and that, on several occasions, the
prosecution refused visit requests by the lawyers. Following the latest renewal
of the detention, Mr. Malek Adly’s lawyers declared their withdrawal from the
prosecution investigation session to protest violations of the right to a fair
trial by the prosecution committee.
 
Mr. Malek Adly is detained in a 6x8
foot cell, without lighting or ventilation. He is unable to leave except for
court sessions or visits with his wife and lawyers. Mr. Adly has also been
denied the right to furnish his cell with a bed and mattress, deprived of his
right to exercise and recreation, barred from visiting the prison library and
mosque or receiving reading material. Though, Mr. Malek Adly is suffering from
high blood pressure and aching joints, he does not have access to medication or
a doctor.
 
Actions requested:
 
Please write to the authorities of Egypt
asking them to:
 
i. Guarantee in all
circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Malek Adly,
including by putting an end to all acts of torture and ill-treatment against
him, as well as of all human rights defenders in Egypt;

ii. Release
immediately and unconditionally Mr. Malek Adly, as well as all human rights
defenders currently in arbitrary detention, as it seems to only aim at
curtailing their human rights activities;
 
iii. Carry out an
immediate, thorough, impartial and transparent investigation into the
allegations of torture and ill-treatment against Mr. Malek Adly, in order to
identify all those responsible, bring them before an independent tribunal, and
sanction them as provided by the law;
 
iv. Put an end to the harassment -
including at the judicial level - against Mr. Malek Adly, as well as against
all human rights defenders in Egypt;
 
v. Comply with all the provisions of
the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, in particular with
its Articles 1, 6(b)(c), and 12.2;
 
vi. Ensure in all circumstances
respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with
international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by
Egypt.
