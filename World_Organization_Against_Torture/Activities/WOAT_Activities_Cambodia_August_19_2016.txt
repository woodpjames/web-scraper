Geneva, 18 August 2016,
Re:
Call on the Human Rights Council to adopt a resolution addressing Cambodia's
gravely deteriorating human rights situation
Your Excellencies,
We, the undersigned international, regional, and
Cambodian non-governmental organizations (NGOs), urge your delegation to
support the adoption of a resolution addressing Cambodia's gravely
deteriorating human rights situation at the 33rd session of the
Human Rights Council (13-30 September 2016). 
This resolution should highlight and condemn the ongoing
and systematic human rights violations in the country and impunity for their
perpetrators; build on the concerns expressed by a number of States at the
Council's 32nd session[1]; and
urge the Cambodian Government to urgently take corrective action to preserve
the legacy of the Paris Peace Agreements,[2] ahead
of their 25th anniversary and of key municipal and general elections
(2017-2018). The resolution should also request the United Nations (UN) Special
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Cambodia, Ms. Rhona Smith, to
assess the status of implementation of the recommendations made to Cambodia by
various UN bodies and mechanisms, including by her and her predecessors,[3] and
to identify benchmarks for progress and priority areas for reform with a view
to putting an end to the ongoing and systematic human rights violations
committed in the country.
The mandate of the Special Rapporteur on Cambodia was
extended for an additional two years at the Coun­cil’s 30th session.
This unique practice of bi-annual country-specific resolutions provides
important continuity to the monitoring of, and public reporting on, the
situation in the country and helps streamline the work of the Council. However,
this should not prevent the Council from exercising its responsibility to take
more de­cisive action given the grave circumstances in Cambodia. 
Latest developments on the ground
Since we expressed deep concern about Cambodia's human
rights situation in a letter sent to your and other delegations prior to the
Human Rights Council's 30th session,[4] our
fear that the country risked “falling deeper into a pattern of institutionalized
human rights violations, including political violence”[5] and
the alarm ex­pressed by the Special Rapporteur that the country was reaching a
“dangerous tipping point,”[6] have
materia­lized.
Indeed, since the adoption of Human Rights Council resolution
30/23[7] on 2
October 2015, the Cambodian Government has taken steps to further restrict the
rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and association, limit the
political opposition's ability to meaningfully engage in policy-making and
campai­gning, and prevent civil society organizations from operating freely and
independently. Legislation that unduly restricts human rights and fundamental
freedoms continues to be in force, including the Law on Association and NGOs
(LANGO), which the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR)
has described as falling “significantly short of international human rights
laws and norms” and as “threatening the existence of a free and independent
civil society in Cambodia,”[8] with
increasing concerns that the government is prepared to use it to arbitrarily
de-register civil society organizations it labels as vio­lating the concept of
“political neutrality.” A Trade Union Law imposing new restrictions on the
right to freedom of association[9] has
also come into force, marking a further downward slide for labor rights in the
country. Security forces continue to suppress peaceful protests, and in recent
months, instances of judicial harassment and unwarranted legal attacks against
human rights defenders, community activists, trade union­ists and political
opposition members and their supporters have multiplied, with no end in sight.
On 12 May 2016, four UN Special Rapporteurs jointly
called on the Government of Cambodia to “stop tar­geting civil society, human
rights defenders, parliamentarians and UN personnel and to take effective mea­sures
to protect civil society and respect fundamental freedoms in the country.”[10] They
highlighted the case of the Cambodian Human Rights and Development Association
(ADHOC), one of Cambodia's oldest, lar­gest, and most-respected human rights
NGOs, whose four senior staff members have been targeted along with a former
staff member, now Deputy Secretary-General of the National Election Committee
(NEC). They have been subjected to a judicial investigation and arbitrary
detention on charges that have all the hall­marks of being
politically-motivated of “bribing a witness” in connection with the provision
of advice and legitimate reimbursement of food and transportation costs to a
woman alleged to have had an extra-marital relationship with the deputy
opposition leader, Kem Sokha. The continued detention of the five defenders, as
well as the threats and intimidation of those who have spoken out in their
defense, including through a cam­paign on social media,[11] has
led to an increasingly repressive environment for freedom of expression and
sent a chilling message to the critics of the government.
On 10 July 2016, prominent Cambodian political analyst
and social justice activist Kem Ley was shot dead in broad daylight at a
convenience store in a petrol station in central Phnom Penh. Following the
attack, five UN Special Rapporteurs jointly stated that “[t]he circumstances of
Mr. Kem Ley's death have given rise to deep concerns in view of his standing as
a critic of the government and his regular comments in the media highlighting
governance and human rights concerns.” They added that his shooting
“exemplifie[d] an alarming negative trend in Cambodia whereby political
activists and human rights defenders are facing in­creasing restrictions […]”
and that his killing is “likely to have a chilling effect on the pursuit of
democracy and human rights in Cambodia.”[12] The
“prompt, thorough and impartial investigation into this crime” by “an independent
body with no ties to the government” they have called for has yet to be
conducted.
These developments have taken place in a context of
increased political tensions, as the country's two oppo­sition leaders, Mr. Sam
Rainsy and Mr. Kem Sokha, President and Vice-President of the Cambodia National
Rescue Party (CNRP) respectively, have been targeted with a series of criminal
allegations that have preven­ted them from effectively participating in
Cambodia's public life.[13] In
addition, 26 political prisoners, inclu­ding human rights defenders,[14] are
currently in detention in Cambodia. Prime Minister Hun Sen and other high-level
officials have threatened several opposition politicians, political
commentators and civil society representatives with legal proceedings,
including for “defamation.” Amid the attacks against civil society and other
critical and independent voices and the increased harassment of the media,
these mounting political tensions threaten to make the elections planned for
2017 and 2018 neither free nor fair.
Suggested language for a strengthened Council
response
In the face of Cambodia's rapidly deteriorating
human rights situation as well as government policies and practices that go
against the spirit and purpose of the Paris Peace Agreements and UN engagement
in the country since, the Human Rights Council should adopt a resolution that: 
- Condemns
threats to, and attacks against, human rights defenders and other critical
or indepen­dent voices; violations of the rights to freedom of peaceful
assembly, association and expression; the lack of independence of the
judiciary; violations of land and housing rights; violations of women's and
indigenous peoples' rights; the erosion of fundamental democratic principles
and institutions; and ongoing impunity for perpetrators of human rights
violations and abuses[15];

- Urges
the Cambodian Government to put an end to these serious violations, abide by
its domestic and international human rights obligations, and implement key
legal and institutional reforms that UN bodies and mechanisms have highlighted
as essential;
- Urges
the Cambodian authorities to immediately release all activists, human rights
defenders, and opposition members and supporters who have been arbitrarily
imprisoned or detained in relation to the exercise of fundamental rights and
freedoms and to drop all charges that have been pressed against any person for
such exercise; 
- Calls
on the Cambodian authorities to carry out prompt, thorough, effective,
transparent, impar­tial and independent investigations into instances of
violence, including the October 2015 assault by three of the Prime Minister’s
bodyguards on two opposition members of the National Assembly and the 10 July
murder of political analyst Kem Ley, and bring perpetrators, including anyone
who may have instigated or orchestrated these acts, to justice in fair trials; 
- Calls
upon the Cambodian Government to repeal laws that are not in line with
international law and standards on the rights to freedom of expression, peaceful
assembly and association, or amend them with a view to bring them into line
with international standards, including the Law on Asso­ciations and NGOs, the
Trade Union Law and the Telecommunications Law; and refrain from adopting
additional legislation that falls short of international standards;
- Calls
upon the Cambodian Government to amend the three “judicial reform laws” (on
the Orga­nization of the Courts, the Statute of Judges and Prosecutors, and the
Organization and Function­ing of the Supreme Council of the Magistracy) that
infringe on the independence of the judiciary, in contravention of
international standards and Cambodia’s Constitution; 
- Calls
on the Cambodian Government to establish a time-bound action plan for the
implement­ation of recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur and by
previous mandate holders, as well as by UN bodies and mechanisms, including
treaty monitoring bodies, thematic special proce­dures of the Human Rights
Council, the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), the OHCHR and the UN
Secretary-General;
- Urges
the Cambodian Government to ensure the transparency and credibility of the
electoral pro­cess and to create the necessary conditions for the upcoming
municipal and general elections to be free, fair, credible, inclusive, peaceful
and transparent, in accordance with the international com­mitments of the
Cambodian Government; in this regard, urges the government to provide
for an expansion of political space and to ensure respect for human rights and
fundamental freedoms, inc­luding the freedoms of expression, online and
offline, peaceful assembly and association; 
- Calls
upon the Cambodian Government to establish an independent, well-resourced
National Hu­man Rights Institution in accordance with the principles relating to
the status of national institu­tions for the promotion and protection of human
rights (the “Paris Principles”); 
- Calls
on the Cambodian Government to fully cooperate with the UN Special
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Cambodia, as well as with other
UN human rights bodies and mecha­nisms;  
- Requests
the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Cambodia to assess
the status of implementation of the recommendations made to Cambodia by various
UN bodies and mecha­nisms, including her and her predecessors, and to identify
benchmarks for progress and priority areas for reform with a view to putting an
end to the serious and systematic human rights viola­tions committed in the
country; 
- Invites
thematic special procedure mandate-holders to engage fully and to coordinate
with the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Cambodia; and 
- Decides
to remain actively seized of the matter. 
We also call upon your Government to express its
support to the renewal of the mandate of the OHCHR country office in Cambodia
through the prompt signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the
Government of Cambodia and the OHCHR, and to underline the importance of the
complementarities between the work of the Special Rapporteur, other UN bodies
and mechanisms and the OHCHR country office. 
*   *   *
 Twenty-five years after the signing of the Paris Peace
Agreements, this resolution should reaffirm the UN’s historical responsibility
to support the Cambodian people's quest for justice, democracy, human rights
and the rule of law. As it examines the situation in Cambodia for the last time
before the country's municipal elections (4 June 2017), the Human Rights
Council should make clear its intention to continue to closely monitor and
address the situation in the country by adopting a resolution that highlights
the abovementioned concerns and urges the Cambodian Government to urgently take
corrective action in this regard.

We thank you for your attention to these pressing issues and are available to
provide your delegation with further information as required.
