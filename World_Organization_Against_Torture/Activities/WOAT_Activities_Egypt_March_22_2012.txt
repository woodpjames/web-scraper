FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION IN JEOPARDY
THE EURO-MEDITERRANEAN HUMAN RIGHTS NETWORK AND THE OBSERVATORY FOR THE
PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENDERS CONCERNED ABOUT THE DETERIORATION OF THE
CONDITIONS FOR THE ENJOYMENT OF FREEDOMS OF ASSOCIATION AND PEACEFUL ASSEMBLY
IN EGYPT
After a fact-finding and advocacy mission on
freedom of association and the situation of civil society organisations
conducted in Egypt from February 11 to 14, 2012, the Euro-Mediterranean Human
Rights Network (EMHRN) and the Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights
Defenders - a joint programme of the International Federation for Human Rights
(FIDH) and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) - are publishing today
the findings of the mission, and note that one year after the Revolution, the
conditions for the enjoyment of freedoms of association and peaceful assembly
in Egypt have significantly deteriorated. Our organisations are particularly
concerned about the direct attacks by the government against Egyptian and
international human rights NGOs.
The delegation was composed of Kamel Jendoubi, EMHRN President and
member of OMCT Executive Council; Raji Sourani, FIDH Vice-President; Khadija
Cherif, FIDH Secretary General on behalf of the Observatory; and Abdessatar Ben
Moussa, President of the Tunisian League for Human Rights (Ligue Tunisienne des Droits de l’Homme - LTDH, a member organisation of EMHRN, FIDH
and OMCT), and met representatives of Egyptian human rights organisations, the
government and Parliament, as well as the EU, other European countries and the
United States.
 
The delegation found that:
1.     
The
media and political campaign aimed at discrediting human rights NGOs by
accusing them of ‘representing foreign interests’ is particularly harmful and
virulent, and serves to undermine the public support enjoyed by these civil
society organisations, which played an important role in the revolution and in
denouncing the violations perpetrated under the regime of former President
Hosni Mubarak;
2.     
Direct
attacks against NGOs are continuing. Following the December 2011 raids in the
offices of several Egyptian and international NGOs, legal proceedings were
initiated against 43 employees of U.S. and German NGOs on February 26, 2012,
for having opened offices in Egypt illegally and having received funds from
abroad. The intimidation is targeting not only these foundations but all human
rights NGOs in general, in an attempt to hinder their activities. Since the
February 2011 revolution, these organisations have been denouncing the abuses committed
by the military council, in particular the severe crackdowns on demonstrations
which resulted in many protesters being killed, and the ongoing attempts to
curtail the rights to freedom of expression, assembly and association;
3.     
Although
they denied that a final draft legislation on associations has been prepared,
government representatives made it clear that they intended to ensure that the
reformed legislative framework will maintain civil society organisations under
tight control, by forcing them to obtain prior authorisation to conduct their
activities, by exerting greater control on funding from outside sources and by
prohibiting them from carrying out any ‘political’ activities, a measure that
is clearly aimed at restricting the human rights associations'  activities of civil vigilance and of
denunciation of abuses;
4.     
In
2011, several demonstrations were violently suppressed, and some of the
defenders covering the human rights violations perpetrated in that framework
were arrested and subjected to judicial harassment.
The EMHRN and the Observatory express their
solidarity with Egyptian human rights organisations, which are conducting their
activities of civil vigilance in increasingly difficult conditions and are
facing the threat of prosecution in the exercise of their legitimate
activities.
Our organisations reiterate their concern about
the deteriorating environment for the enjoyment of the rights to freedom of
association and peaceful assembly, and call upon the Egyptian authorities to
comply with their international and constitutional obligations in this regard -
and in particular to immediately put an end to all judicial proceedings and
acts of harassment against human rights defenders and non-governmental
organisations - and to initiate a genuine democratic transition process, which
is a prerequisite for the development of a diverse, independent civil society.
Our organisations also call upon the Egyptian
government to accede as soon as possible to the requests to visit Egypt made by
the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Rights to Freedom of Peaceful
Assembly and Association, and the UN Special Rapporteur on the Situation of
Human Rights Defenders, especially in light of the intervention made by the
Egyptian mission on the occasion of the interactive dialogue with the Special
Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights Defenders during the 19th
session of the United Nations Human Rights Council.
In particular, the EMHRN and the Observatory
urge the newly elected representatives of the Egyptian people in Parliament to
break with past practices and to encourage the development and expression of an
active and autonomous civil society. This requires the adoption of a
legislative framework on associations compatible with international standards in
this area, in consultation with civil society organisations, some of which have
submitted a proposal in that regard. It is useful to remind that the
implementation of international standards on freedom of association and of good
financial management practices favour transparency in the administration of
associations without requiring interference and prior control by the
authorities.
The EMHRN and the Observatory call
upon the European Union to engage in the active promotion of the rights to
freedom of association and peaceful assembly in Egypt, to implement the
instruments designed to support civil society created in the framework of the
European Neighbourhood Policy and the Guidelines on Human Rights Defenders, and
to make any future cooperation with the Egyptian government conditional upon
the achievement of genuine democratic progress and respect for public freedoms.
Our
organisations call upon the UN Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights Defenders, the UN
Special Rapporteur on the Rights to Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and of
Association, and the Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights
Defenders in Africa of the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights to
call upon the Egyptian authorities to guarantee the physical and psychological
integrity of all human rights defenders in Egypt, to prevent and put an end to
violations of fundamental rights and freedoms, and to investigate all such
violations when they occur, and bring all those responsible to justice.
