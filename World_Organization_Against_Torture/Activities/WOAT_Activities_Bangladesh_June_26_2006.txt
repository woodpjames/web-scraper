The information provided is based on fact-finding investigations carried out by ODHIKAR with local people, the police and hospital authorities.  According to two eyewitnesses, Mr. Sajidur Rahman, a medical representative of a pharmaceutical company who lived in D Aid Road, was seized from the moor of Markaja Mosjid near Gaibandha Railway station by two men in civil cloth on the evening of 18 May 2006. Local people and shopkeepers gathered around, followed by the arrival of two police vans from Gainbandha Sadar police station. When the police started to ask Mr. Sajidur Rahman questions, he allegedly handed them something wrapped in paper. It is reported that the police unwrapped the packet and found a black object, which looked like a pistol and some bullets. Mr. Sajidur Rahman was then taken to the police station.   According to Md. Nure Alam, the officer in charge of Gaibandha Sadar police station, Mr. Sajidur Rahman was arrested for the possession of a gun. Sub Inspector (SI) Masud Rana filed a case (no. 19, 18/05/2006) under section 19 (a) of the Arms Act 1878 at the Gaibandha Sadar police station. On 19 May 2006, the police applied for 10 days remand but 7 days were granted by the Court. SI Abu Yusuf, the investigating officer, made enquiries and questioned Mr. Rahman while he was under remand. On 21 May 2006, Md. Nure Alam reported that Mr. Sajidur Rahman hung himself with his Lungi (traditional Bangladeshi dress for the lower part of the body) and that an unnatural death suit was filed in this regard. Police handed over the dead body to his family at noon on 22 May 2006 after post mortem. He was buried that afternoon with heavy police security presence at the funeral.  It is reported that Mr. Nure Alam added that SI Fahmida Khatun, who was the duty officer at Gaibandha police station that day, and Constable Dulal Sarkar were temporarily suspended for neglecting their duties as they were both present at the police station at the time the incident occurred and were therefore responsible for the welfare of Mr. Sajidur Rahman.  According to the information received, local people reacted on the incident by demonstrating and protesting, a hunger strike and by besieging the office of the Superintendent of police. On 27 May 2006, the authorities, allegedly finding no other alternative to reduce the tension, transferred SI Sajjad, SI Abu Rahyan and SI Masud Rana, all Sub Inspectors at Gaibandha Sadar police station, and Md. Nure Alam to different police stations within the district. Moreover, SI Abu Yusuf, investigating officer of the case, was arrested in connection with Mr. Sajidur Rahman’s death and sent to prison.   Furthermore, an inquiry committee had been formed with Kaem Uddin, Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP), acting as the convener. The contents of the report of the inquiry committee have so far not been made public. Yet, ODHIKAR was informed by the officer in charge of Gaibandha Sadar police station that the case of Sajidur Rahman is under the process of being sent to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID). On the day of fact-finding, ASI Mousumi Sultana, duty officer of Gaibandha Sadar police station that day, declined to say anything about the death of Mr. Sajidur Rahman, as she was not on duty the day of the incident.   It is alleged by family members that Mr. Rahman died under torture. They reported to have noticed a black stain across Mr. Rahman throat and red rings covering his body. Moreover, Mr. Rahman’s elder brother, Majid, met his brother on 21 May 2006 at around 3.30 pm, and found that his brother looked quite normal. He added that his brother was the only person in custody at the police station at that time. However, during the fact-finding investigation at the Gaibandha Sadar police station, ODHIKAR came to know that there was an accused person in another cell.   Mr. Sajidur Rahman’s post mortem report which was prepared by a medical board of three members - including at its head the resident medical officer of Gaibandha Sadar Hospital, Mr. Aminul Islam - states that no marks were found on Mr. Rahman’s body apart from a black stain on his throat. This was confirmed by the Dome (the person who is assigned to dissecting dead bodies in the hospital) to ODHIKAR.  Action requested Please write to the authorities in Bangladesh urging them to: i.	Order a thorough and impartial investigation into these events, in order to identify all those responsible, bring them to trial and apply the civil penal and/or administrative sanctions as provided by law; ii.
