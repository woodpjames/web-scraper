Description of the situation: The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources, including Adalah, Al-Haq, Defence for Children International - Palestine Section (DCI-PS), and the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel (PCATI), about the arbitrary detention of Mr. Mohammad Bsharat, Executive Director of the Nafha Society for the Defence of Prisoners and Human Rights, in Nablus. According to the information received, on August 2, 2007, late at night, Israeli soldiers arrested Mr. Mohammad Bsharat without an arrest warrant in Nablus. He was then detained and interrogated at the Huwara detention centre in Nablus, which is known for its poor conditions of detention. Since then, no charges have been brought against Mr. Bsharat. According to his lawyer, he would have been questioned about his human rights activities. On August 12 and again on August 19, 2007, Mr. Bsharat’s detention was extended. During the last hearing on August 26, 2007, the Salem military court ordered that he be detained administratively, without any precision regarding the duration of the detention, nor any official reason. The Observatory recalls that according to the Israeli law, the status of administrative detention denies all civil and political rights to the detainees. Therefore, the authorities do not have to charge the prisoner, nor to bring him to trial. Legally established and registered with the Palestinian Authority in 2006, Nafha is one of several NGOs representing Palestinian detainees in Israeli courts and advocating on behalf of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli prisons and detention centres. It also works with released prisoners to help ease them back into daily life and offers prisoners’ families, in particular their children, psychological and social support. The Observatory expresses its deep concern at the arbitrary detention of Mr. Mohammad Bsharat as it seems to merely aim at sanctioning his human rights activities. Moreover, the Observatory fears for his physical and psychological integrity, as Mr. Bsharat suffers from chronic hyper-sensitivity and severe renal spasms as a result of kidney stones and as he is not getting proper medical attention. The Observatory recalls that Israel must conform with the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 9, 1998, especially its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, article 9.3.c which states that “Everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to offer and provide professionally qualified legal assistance or other relevant advice and assistance in defending human rights and fundamental freedoms” and Article 12.1 (“everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to participate in peaceful activities against violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms”). Actions requested: Please write to the authorities in Israel urging them to:  Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Mohammad Bsharat; Release Mr. Mohammad Bsharat since his detention is arbitrary as it merely aims at sanctioning his human rights activities; Ensure that he has access to adequate medical treatment; Put an end to any kind of harassment against all human rights defenders in Israel; Comply with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly on December 9, 1998, in particular with above-mentioned Articles 1, 9.3.c and 12.1; More generally, ensure in all circumstances the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with international human rights instruments ratified by Israel.
