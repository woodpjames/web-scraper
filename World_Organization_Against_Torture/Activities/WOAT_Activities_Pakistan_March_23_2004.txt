Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Asian Human Rights  Commission, a member of the OMCT network, of the killing in the name of honour of Ms. Shahul on February 21, 2004 in Pakistan.  According to the information received, Ms. Shahul, a 25 year old woman, was killed by her husband, Mr. Manthar Ali Shar, on February 21, 2004 around 8:30 pm. Reports from relatives indicate that Mr. Manthar Ali Shar had accused his wife of having illicit sexual relations (karo kari), classifying this killing as one perpetrated in the name of "honour."  According to the First Information Report filed by the victim's brother, Mr. Khair Bux Shar, at the Dakhan Police Station, the victim and her husband got married about 9 years ago and lived in a joint family environment (together with the brother and other relatives). The report claims that on the night in question the couple had had a “minor domestic quarrel.” At 8:30 pm that night, the brother and his two cousins were awoken by a gun shot in the dairy farm, where Mr. Manthar Ali Shar and Ms. Shahul were staying. They went to the dairy farm and found Ms. Shahul bleeding seriously from her left shoulder, and Mr. Manthar Ali Shar was seen fleeing the scene with a pistol in his hand. Ms. Shahul died later that night from the gunshot wound.  The information received indicates that the case may be disposed compoundable under the Ordinance of Qisas and Dayat (whereby the offender can escape punishment by providing compensation to the victim's family). It is reported that the family seems likely to make an arrangement of this sort, as they live in a joint family environment and do not want the perpetrator to receive too heavy a punishment. The information suggests that police have been bribed to treat this case as a “minor domestic quarrel,” rather than a case of killing in the name of honour.   OMCT expresses its grave concern that killings in the name of honour reportedly take place on a regular basis in Pakistan, despite national laws which prohibit this practice (See OMCT appeal PAK 120204.VAW). In this case, OMCT is particularly concerned that the police may not fully investigate the case if the perpetrator pays the family a sum of money. The information received cites another human rights organization in Pakistan, which reports that in September 2003, at least 631 women and 6 girls had been killed by their relatives in the name of honour since January 2003. It is suspected that the number of victims of this form of violence against women is much higher, as these numbers only represent the cases that had been reported in the newspapers.   In Pakistan, husbands, fathers, boyfriends or brothers have gone unpunished after murdering wives, daughters, girlfriends or sisters in order to defend the honour of the family or their own honour. The killing normally occurs when a woman allegedly steps outside of her socially prescribed role, especially but not only, with regard to her sexuality and to her interaction with men outside her family.   OMCT firmly condemns these killings in the name of honour and calls upon the government of Pakistan to investigate, prosecute and punish the perpetrators with due diligence. OMCT recalls that the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women, in article 4(c), states that States should "exercise due diligence to prevent, investigate and, in accordance with national legislation, punish acts of violence against women, whether those acts are perpetrated by the State or by private persons."  Action requested  Please write to the authorities in Pakistan urging them to:  i.	order a thorough and impartial investigation into the circumstances of this killing, in order to identify those responsible, bring them to trial and apply the penal and/or administrative sanctions as provided by law; ii.	ensure that the prohibition of killings in the name of honour is strictly respected and that all law enforcement authorities react to such killings with appropriate vigour to hold the responsible parties accountable iii.	guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
