This decree states that  "representatives of non-governmental associations can be  representatives of physical persons in civil trials in general courts  only in cases the law allows them to represent and protect the rights  and interests of the members of those associations and other persons  in courts". Moreover, in his yearly message to the Parliament, the  President noted that the practice for representatives of NGOs to  represent the interests of citizens damages the institution of  advocacy. According to Belarus Helsinki Committee, this decree  contradicts Article 62 of the Belarus Constitution, which does not  limit the right of citizens to choose their representatives in  courts. It also contradicts Article 73 of the Civil Procedural Code,  which lists limitations to this right only regarding minors, disabled  or partially disabled persons, as well as judges, investigators and  prosecutors. The aim of this Decree is obviously to prohibit NGOs to  represent the interests of citizens in civil trials, thus hindering  their activity. The Observatory insists that this Decree violates  Article 9 (3) (c) of the U.N. Declaration on Human Rights Defenders  of 9 December 1998. This article states that "...everyone has the  right, individually and in association with others... to offer and  provide professionally qualified legal assistance or other relevant  advice and assistance in defending human rights and fundamental  freedoms".  Furthermore, Human Rights Defenders, as well as non-governmental  organisations, are subject to constant pressure, which takes many  forms: judicial liquidations of NGOs, check-ups and threats of check- ups of NGOs' premises, warnings, etc.  The Observatory notes with deep concern that an increasing number of  NGOs are liquidated for alleged administrative irregularities. In  April, "Ratusha", a regional NGO, was liquidated for non-permitted  editorial activity. The Agency of Regional Development "Varuta" was  liquidated because only its shortened name appeared on internal  documents. "Youth Christian Union" in Minsk was liquidated for  activities that allegedly contradicted its statutes (e.g. support to  refugees) and non-presentation of the list of its members to the  Ministry of Justice. In May, "Civil initiatives" was liquidated for,  among others, purposeless use of equipment received as free  assistance, and distortion of its name. On 31 July, Vitsebsk Regional  Court ordered the liquidation of the Centre of Youth Initiatives  "Kontur" because since August 2000, its office had moved, and was not  situated at its registered address any more. The Court also claimed  that Kuntur used the financial support of foreign non-profit  organisations without the appropriate authorisation.   On 2 August, judicial proceedings started in the Minsk City Court for  the liquidation of "Legal Assistance to Population". According to the  Civil Code, the Law about Public Associations, and Presidential  Decree n° 13, this activity requires a licence, which the NGO did not  have, because it was previously deprived of it by the Justice  Ministry. It is worth mentioning that Legal Assistance to Population  provides the families of the missing Belarus political opponents with  legal assistance. The organisation head, Oleg Volchek, is the  representative of Yuri Zakharenko. He also represented the interests  of the families of the children who died at a pedestrian underground  crossing in Minsk, in May 1999. The accident, at the occasion of  which 53 people died, was reportedly due to police negligence.  Moreoever, Viasna, a Human Rights NGO, has also lately experienced  check-ups, or threats of check-ups, of five of its offices. The first  check-up concerned the regional office in Brest. It was conducted by  the Justice Board of Brest Regional Executive Committee (REC) in  March 2003, immediately after the election to local Deputy Soviets. A  report was sent to the Ministry of Justice subsequently to the check- up, alleging accountancy irregularities. To this day, however, the  Minister of Justice has not reacted to the report. The Justice Board  of Minsk REC was also planning to carry out a check-up of the office  in Minsk. It did not take place, however, because the office had been  liquidated in the meantime. At the end of June, check-ups of the  offices of Vitebsk and of Gomel were still ongoing. The Observatory  thus fears that Viasna may be the next victim of governmental  repression.  In July the Justice Board of Minsk City Executive issued a warning to  the local Human Rights NGO "Independent Association of Juridical  Research", because it had  represented the interests of Ratusha during the liquidation trial in  Hrodna. According to the warning, the organisation infringed the Law  on public associations by carrying  out an activity outside the city of Minsk where it is registered. On  29 July, the "Belarus Organisation of Working Women" was warned for  violation of the rules concerning  production and keeping of seals, and creation of bodies that were not  mentioned in its Statutes. It also allegedly printed a wrong  registered address on some documents.  Finally, the Observatory would like to insist on the situation of  Professor Yuri Bandazhevsky. He is in jail since two years, serving  an eight years' imprisonment sentence  thought to be linked with the fact that he openly criticised the  reaction of the State authorities to the disastrous impact of the  Chernobyl catastrophe on population's health.  On 7 July 2003, the UN Human Rights Committee declared that Mr  Bandazhevsky's communication for consideration under the Optional  Protocol to the International  Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was admissible. The Committee  requested the State of Belarus, in its capacity as State party to the  Protocol, to submit written  explanations clarifying the matter, and expose measures that have  been taken. On several occasions, the Observatory expressed its  concern that the conditions of  imprisonment may severely impact on his health in the long term. In  December 2002, the Observatory requested from the authorities the  authorisation to organise an  investigative mission on Mr Bandazhevsky's conditions of detentions.  The authorities did not follow up on this request (see press release  on 17 April 2003). The Observatory  is deeply concerned about the current condition of Mr Bandazhevsky,  and is calling for his immediate and unconditional release.    The Observatory notes that all these facts contradict the principles  of freedom of association and of freedom of expression. Furthermore,  they constitute grave and blatant  violations of the U.N.  Declaration on Human Rights Defenders,  especially Article 1 which states that "everyone has the right,  individually and in association with others, to  promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human  rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international  levels". According to Article 2, "each  State has the prime responsibility and duty to protect, promote and  implement all human rights and fundamental freedoms". Article 5  guarantees the right to "meet or  assemble peacefully; to form, join and participate in non- governmental organisations or groups; to communicate with non- governmental or intergovernmental organisations",  for the purpose of promoting human rights and fundamental freedoms.  In light of the above, The International Federation for Human Rights  (FIDH), and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) within the  framework of their joint  programme, the Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights  Defenders, urge the Belarus authorities:  - To cease harassment and intimidation of non-governmental  organisations and individuals engaged in the protection of Human  Rights; - To take all necessary measures to ensure that human rights  defenders can exert their activity free from State interference; - To release individuals detained for their commitment to the  protection of human rights; - To comply with the request of the UN Human Rights Committee, and to  release Yuri Bandazhevsky immediately and unconditionally; - To implement international and regional instruments for the  protection of human rights binding on Belarus, and to comply with  Resolution on the situation of Human Rights  in Belarus adopted by the UN Commission on Human Rights on 17 April  2003; - To invite Mrs. Hina Jilani, Special Representative of the UN  Secretary-General on Human Rights Defenders, and the UN Working Group  on Arbitrary Detention, to go to Belarus in order to assess the  situation.
