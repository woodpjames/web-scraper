Ms. Mohammadi’s lawyer was not allowed to defend her and was denied access to the court file. After her arrest on September 3, 2018 (see background information), Ms. Rezvaneh Mohammadi was kept in solitary confinement and interrogated for 26 days in the notorious Ward 209[1]of Tehran’s Evin prison, before being transferred to a women’s dormitory ward on September 29, 2018. She was released on bail on October 20, 2018, upon deposit of 1,500,000,000 Iranian Rials (approximately 11,000 Euros). The Observatory recalls that Ms. Rezvaneh Mohammadi’s arrest is part of a broader crackdown against gender rights activists by Iran’s security forces. For example, Ms. Maryam Azad[2], an LGBTI rights activist from the city of Shiraz, Fars Province, was arrested on September 25, 2018, when she attempted to board a flight at Tehran airport bound for Turkey. The Observatory expresses its deepest concern about the continuing judicial harassment against Ms. Rezvaneh Mohammadi, which seems to be only aimed at sanctioning her for her legitimate human rights activities, and notes that it is the first time a human rights defender has been charged and tried for “normalising same-sex relations” in the country. If convicted, Ms. Mohammadi’s case would constitute a dangerous precedent for gender equality defenders.  The Observatory urges the Iranian authorities to end any act of harassment, including at the judicial level, against Ms. Rezvaneh Mohammadi and all Iranian human rights defenders. Background information:  Ms. Rezvaneh Mohammadi was arrested on September 3, 2018[3], at her home in Tehran, and taken to the Intelligence Ministry-run Ward 209 within Evin prison. Her phone and other electronic devices were confiscated and she was held incommunicado for two days. At that time, the authorities did not provide any reason for her arrest and she was denied family visits for the whole duration of her detention. This was not the first time she had suffered from judicial harassment. In March 2018, Ms. Rezvaneh Mohammadi was also arrested by the morality police in Gorgan, Golestan Province, for not wearing “Islamic clothing”. She was held for one night in a police detention centre and released on bail. She was then acquitted by the Gorgan city court. Actions requested: Please write to the authorities of Iran asking them to: ii. Guarantee in all circumstances the physical integrity and psychological well-being of Ms. Rezvaneh Mohammadi, as well as that of all other Iranian human rights defenders.; iii. Drop all charges pending against Ms. Rezvaneh Mohammadi and meanwhile ensure that all judicial proceedings against her are carried out in full compliance with her right to a fair trial, as protected under international law; iv. Put an end to all acts of harassment, including at the judicial level, against Ms. Rezvaneh Mohammadi as well as that all other human rights defenders arbitrarily detained in the country, and ensure they are able to carry out their activities without hindrance; v. Conform to all the provisions of the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 9, 1998, in particular its Articles 1, 6, 9, 11 and 12; vi. Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by Iran. Addresses:• Leader of the Islamic Republic, H.E.
