The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), has received new information and requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in the Russian Federation.
New information:
The Observatory has been informed by the Human Rights Centre Memorial about the confirmation on appeal, by the Moscow City Court, of the conviction for “defamation” of the Memorial Human Rights Centre and Mr. Oleg Orlov, Chairman of the Board.
According to the information received, on January 21, 2010, the Moscow City Civil Court heard the appeal lodged both by Mr. Oleg Orlov together with the Memorial Human Rights Centre and by the representative of the Chechen President, Mr. Ramzan Kadyrov. The Court confirmed the previous decision of October 6, 2009 of the Tverskoy District Court of Moscow, which had found the Centre and its Chairman guilty of defamation in a civil action initiated by Chechen President Ramazan Kadyrov for damaging his “honour and dignity” and ordered Memorial Human Rights Centre to pay 50,000 rubles (about 1,194 Euros) and Mr. Orlov to personally pay 20,000 rubles (about 450 Euros) in damages. At the same time, the Court rejected Mr. Kadyrov’s request to increase the amount of the fines imposed on Mr. Orlov and the Memorial Human Rights Centre.
Mr. Oleg Orlov intend to appeal the decision before the presidium of the Moscow City Court and the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation and, if necessary, to bring the case to the European Court.
In addition, the Observatory recalls that on October 20, 2009, the Moscow Central Directorate of Internal Affaires (GUVD) opened a criminal investigation against Mr. Orlov, following a complaint lodged by Mr. Kadyrov. However, no charges have been brought against him so far.
Even though Memorial Human Rights Centre and Mr. Oleg Orlov have been sentenced to symbolic fines, the Observatory deplores the civil court’s ruling, which takes place in a context where the harassment of human rights defenders has reached an unprecedented and worrying level.
The Observatory believes that Mr. Oleg Orlov and Memorial Human Rights Centre are being judicially harassed merely due to the exercise of their right to freedom of expression, which is guaranteed by the Constitution of the Russian Federation and international instruments ratified by the Russian Federation. On October 29, 2009, the Representative for the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) on Freedom of the Media, Mr. Milklos Haraszti, pointed out that “statements like Orlov’s are perfectly legitimate in a democracy and should be subject neither to civil-law nor to criminal-law sanctioning”[1].
The Observatory reiterates its deepest concern regarding the safety of human rights defenders in the Russian Federation, and recalls that in 2009, four human rights defenders covering human rights violations committed in Chechnya were killed: Mr. Stanislav Markelov, a prominent human rights lawyer, and Ms. Anastacia Baburova, freelance journalist, in Moscow; Ms. Natalia Estemirova; Mrs. Zarema Sadulayeva and her husband Mr. Alik (Umar) Dzhabrailov, respectively Head of the office and member of the NGO “Save the Generation” in Grozny.
Background information:
On July 15, 2009, Mr. Oleg Orlov had published a statement in which he indicated he believed that President Kadyrov, or his administration, was “vinoven” (literally “guilty”)[2] for the murder of the Head of Memorial’s office in Grozny, Ms. Natalia Estemirova. Following Mr. Oleg Orlov’s statement, President Ramzan Kadyrov lodged a civil complaint of libel against him and asked for 10 million rubles (approximately 238,932 Euros) in damages.
On October 6, 2009, the Tverskoy District Court of Moscow ordered Mr. Oleg Orlov to retract his statement and ordered Memorial Human Rights Centre to pay 50,000 rubles (about 1,194 Euros) and Mr. Orlov to personally pay 20,000 rubles (about 450 Euros) in damages[3] .

[2] The word “vinoven” (literally “guilty”) bears a double meaning in Russian. The word can indeed be used in a legal manner, but also in a way that is close to the idea of “responsibility”. Mr. Orlov argues that he used the word “vinoven” in the sense of a “political guilt”, not a legal one.
[3] The Observatory had sent an international judicial observation to this trial, which took place on September 25 and October 6, 2009. For more information, see the judicial observation mission report, which is available in English on the following weblinks:
