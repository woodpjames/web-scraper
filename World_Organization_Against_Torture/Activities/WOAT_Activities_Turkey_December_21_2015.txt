The Observatory for the Protection of Human
Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the International Federation for Human Rights
(FIDH) and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent
intervention in the following situation in Turkey.
 
Brief description of the situation:
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable
sources about the continuous harassment of the Human Rights
Association (İHD) members, orchestrated in the context of a broad wave of
arrests targeting human rights defenders in Turkey.
 
According to the
information received, on December 10, 2015 early in the
morning, the police arrested Mr. Atilla Yazar, İHD Şanlıurfa branch co-president, at his house. He was
released later in the afternoon. Mr. Yazar was arrested for allegedly violating
the Law on Public Meetings and Demonstration (No. 2911) because he was
participating in a protest that took place in Şanliurfa, following the October
10 tragedy that left scores of people dead and wounded in Ankara.
 
Several
other NGO representatives were also arrested or harassed by the police. Among
others, Ms. Nalan Durdu, İHD Şanlıurfa
branch co-chair, who was at that time in Istanbul, was notified an arrest
warrant on the same day and was asked to appear before the prosecution office
as soon as she would be back to Şanlıurfa, which she did. At this occasion, she
was questioned about her involvement in the protest and eventually released.
 
While no formal charges have yet been filed against them, both Mr. Yazar
and Ms. Durdu are under investigation and face prosecution. 
 
The Observatory condemns the continuous harassment of IHD members, which
are only
an illustration of a wider trend of repression against human
rights defenders in Turkey. It further denounces that the Turkish authorities
are overstepping the law, which increasingly threatens freedom of association,
assembly and expression, further shrinking space for civil society. 
 
The
Observatory recalls that on September 30, 2015, three İHD members were also
arrested during a police operation launched against Kurdish political parties
and non-governmental organisations in Siirt province in South-East Turkey. The
operations resulted in the arrest of at least ten people. During the illegal
raid, the police confiscated books, reports and other documents, as well as
computers belonging to İHD[1].
 
More
recently, on November 28, 2015, Mr. Tahir Elçi, President of the Bar
Association in South-East Diyarbakir province and member of İHD, was shot in
the face by unidentified men in a gun attack, after delivering a statement
along with other lawyers at a press conference organised by the Bar Association
in Diyarbakir[2].
 
The Observatory therefore calls upon the Turkish authorities to end the
widespread crackdown against human rights defenders in the country and
guarantee in all circumstances their physical and psychological integrity. 
 
Actions requested:
 
Please write to the authorities of Turkey,
urging them to: 
 
i.   
Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and
psychological integrity of all İHD members as well as of all human rights defenders in Turkey;
 
ii.  
Put an end to any act of harassment - including
at the judicial level - against Mr. Atilla Yazar and
Ms. Nalan Durdu, all IHD members as well as against all human rights defenders
in Turkey;
 
iii. Put an end to the crackdown
on civil society under the pretext of countering terrorism and recognise the
legitimate role of human rights defenders in line with universal human rights
standards;
 
iv.  Comply with the
provisions of the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted
by the UN General Assembly on December 9, 1998, especially:
-  Article 1, which
states that “everyone has the right, individually or in association with
others, to promote the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental
freedoms at the national and international levels”,
-  and Article 12.2
which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the
protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in
association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto
or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a
consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the
present Declaration”; 
 
v. More generally, ensure in all circumstances the respect for human rights
and fundamental freedoms in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights and with international and regional human rights instruments ratified by
Turkey.
