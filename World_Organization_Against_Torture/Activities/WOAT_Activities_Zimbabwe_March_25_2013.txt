The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), has received new information and requests your urgent intervention on the following situation in Zimbabwe.
 
New information:
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources of the release on bail of Ms. Beatrice Mtetwa, human rights lawyer and board member of Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights (ZLHR).
 
According to the information received, on March 25, 2013 in the morning, High Court Judge Joseph Musakwa finally decided to grant bail to Ms. Mtetwa, under three conditions: that she deposits $500, that she resides at the given address and that she does not interfere with the ongoing investigations.
 
At 1.40 pm on March 25, Ms. Beatrice Mtetwa finally walked out of Prison Bondage.
 
The Observatory recalls that Ms. Mtetwa was arrested on March 17, 2013, while attempting to provide legal assistance to Mr. Thabani Mpofu, Legal adviser of Zimbabwean Prime Minister, Morgan Tsvangirai, who was arrested the same day[1]. Soon after her arrest, Ms. Mtetwa's lawyers filed an urgent chamber application before the High Court, requesting for her immediate release on the grounds that her arrest was unlawful. While the High Court subsequently ordered her immediate release, Ms. Mtetwa remained in police custody, in complete disregard for the court's ruling.
 
On March 19, 2013, Ms. Mtetwa was brought to the Magistrate Court in Harare where she applied for another bail, given the police non-compliance with the High Court order. On March 20, the Magistrate Court in Harare ruled against the bail application for Ms. Mtetwa, remanding her to April 3, 2013.
 
At the March 20 hearing, Magistrate Marehwanazvo Gofa had indeed told the court that Ms. Mtetwa was facing serious charges of “obstructing the course of justice” under the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act, section 184(1)(g), after she reportedly rebuked the Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) officers who searched - without a search warrant - the house of her client, Mr. Thabani Mpofu. Ms. Mtetwa's lawyer reminded the court that a High Court order providing for the immediate release of Ms. Mtetwa had been issued to the police a few hours after her arrest, and that it had been disregarded. Magistrate Gofa reportedly dismissed Ms. Mtetwa's bail application on the basis that if granted bail, she would interfere with police investigations.
 
Ms. Mtetwa's lawyers had then decided to file an appeal asking the Higher Court to set aside the dismissal of her bail application by Harare Provincial Magistrate Marehwanazvo Gofa. While the High Court bail application hearing was initially scheduled for March 22, it was eventually postponed to March 25, 2013.
