 main goal of this sponsorship project is to 
protect the defenders who have become victims of persecution and acts of
 harassment as a result of their activities in defense of fundamental 
rights and freedoms. By encouraging Swiss and international 
personalities to rally around these defenders, the project has created a
 chain of solidarity which extends beyond the restricted circle of 
“specialists” and aims at mobilising public opinion, the only real 
counterweight to the arbitrary power of States.
