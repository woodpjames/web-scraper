Judicial harassment
Bahrain
November 3, 2015
The Observatory for the Protection of
Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the International Federation for
Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), has
received new information and requests your urgent intervention in the following
situation in Bahrain.
New information:
The Observatory has been informed by
reliable sources about the continuing judicial harassment of Ms. Ghada
Jamsheer, Head of the Women's Petition Committee, an organisation which
campaigns for the rights and dignity of women in the Shari'ah family courts.
According to information received, on October 1, 2015,
the Second Lower Criminal Court held its first hearing against Ms. Ghada
Jamsheer on charges of “verbal and physical confrontation with a police woman”.
The Court then adjourned the hearing to November 11, 2015. The
Prosecution alleges that Ms. Jamsheer assaulted a police officer while she was
detained in September 2014.
Besides, Ms. Jamsheer is facing other charges in
appeal in a trial before the High Criminal Court of Appeal, related to a
separate case for allegedly “assaulting a police officer”, for which she has
been sentenced in first instance to one year in prison, suspended for three
years (see background information). On October 29, the High Criminal Court of
Appeal refused the requests filed by Ms. Jamsheer[1]
and adjourned the hearing to November 23 for the verdict. 
The Observatory strongly condemns the continuous
judicial harassment of Ms. Ghada Jamsheer, which seems to merely aim at
sanctioning her human rights activities, and calls upon the Bahraini
authorities to immediately and unconditionally drop all charges against her.
Background information:
Over the past years, Ms. Jamsheer has come
under permanent surveillance with a 24-hour presence of plainclothes Public
Security officials of the Ministry of the Interior in front of her home.
On September 14, 2014, Ms. Jamsheer was
arrested and arbitrarily detained for more than three months on allegations of
defamation, in connection with messages posted via her Twitter account
criticising corruption in the management of King Hamad Hospital in Bahrain,
which is run by members of the ruling family. Various charges were brought
against Ms. Jamsheer based on the above-mentioned Twitter posts resulting in
twelve criminal cases. 
Hearings in a total of 12 criminal cases
against Ms. Jamsheer have been regularly adjourned without any reason, in
violation of Ms. Jamsheer’s right to be tried within a reasonable time.
On October 29, 2014, the Third Criminal
Court acquitted Ms. Jamsheer in one case, fined her 100 BHD (approx. €210) in
another case, and granted bail upon the payment of 50 BHD pending the decision
on the other Twitter cases. However, Ms. Jamsheer had to wait until November 27
to be released, and was again rearrested only 12 hours later on new charges of
“assaulting two police women”. She was again released on December 15, 2014, and
further put under house arrest until January 15, 2015. 
On May 5, 2015, the Bahrain High Criminal Court sentenced Ms. Jamsheer to a one year prison term, suspended for
three years on charges of “assaulting a police officer”. 
On
June 9, 2015, the Third Lower Criminal
Court sentenced Ms. Jamsheer to one year and eight months imprisonment on charges of defamation in connection
with messages posted via her Twitter account criticising alleged corruption in
the management of King Hamad Hospital in Bahrain. Ms. Jamsheer paid a bail of
400 BHD (approx 1,200 USD) and filed an appeal. 
The Observatory recalls that on December
29, 2014, UN
experts urged the government of Bahrain to drop
charges against Ms. Jamsheer, as she was sentenced “purely for [her]
criticism of government authorities. [...] Such criticism is not only fully
legitimate according to Bahrain’s obligations under human rights law; it is also
essential to the free and public debate necessary for a healthy civil society”
they added.
Furthermore, Ms. Jamsheer has faced other
acts of harassment. For instance, on March 14, 2015, Ms. Jamsheer was denied
the right to board on a plane at Bahrain International Airport by the airport's
security office as she attempted to travel to France to receive medical
treatment. Ms. Jamsheer, who did not receive any prior notification, was not
given any reason for the travel ban. On March 23, 2015, Ms. Jamsheer complained
to the Public Prosecutor's office regarding the travel ban and was informed
that she should submit a travel request to the High Criminal Court. The Court
reviewed her request on April 12, 2015 and decided to waive the travel ban,
stating that there was no solid reason for such a restriction. Nonetheless, on
April 15, 2015, the office of the Public Prosecutor was still unable to provide
Ms. Jamsheer with a formal authorisation to travel, stating that the file was
now in the hands of the immigration office.
