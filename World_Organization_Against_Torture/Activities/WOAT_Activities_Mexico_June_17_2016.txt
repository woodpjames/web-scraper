Brussels/Mexico City – June 17, 2016
We, the undersigned European and Mexican civil society
organisations look forward to the 4th EU-Mexico Civil Society (CSO)
Seminar scheduled for next Monday 20 June, prior to the 6th high
level Human Rights Dialogue between the European Union and Mexico. 
In a global context of shrinking space for civil society,
our organisations stress the importance of meaningful consultation and
participation of civil society in the context of political, legislative and other
decision-making processes, as well as in bilateral agreements and cooperation
projects. In this sense, our organisations value the opportunity to have an
open exchange on the human rights situation in Mexico as well as within the
European Union, and to provide constructive recommendations to the authorities
on how to better tackle human rights violations.
Within this framework, we strongly encourage Mexico and the EU
to take into serious consideration the recommendations of the CSO Seminar and
to ensure their concrete implementation and follow-up the following year. This
is a crucial commitment to give substantial meaning to this annual practice of
civil society consultation, especially considering that many of the
recommendations issued by civil society in the past years unfortunately
continue to be valid in 2016. Therefore, we strongly encourage Mexican and EU
authorities to use this 6th Human Rights Dialogue to guarantee the
effective respect, protection and fulfillment of human rights, including by
implementing the recommendations of civil society.
This year’s human rights dialogue takes place against the
backdrop of a severe financial crisis affecting the Inter-American Commission
of Human Rights (IACHR). In the spirit of joint commitment to human rights in
the Americas, we urgently call on both sides to work toward a strong and stable
funding structure to guarantee the protection and promotion of human rights
throughout the region and to foster impactful exchanges between regional human
rights mechanisms.
Finally, to promote a climate of constructive cooperation, we
encourage the European and Mexican authorities to allow the attendance of CSO
representatives during the high level Human Rights Dialogue, in order to
enhance transparency, cooperation and accountability throughout the process.
Our organisations would like to recall that the EU set some best practices in
this direction within the framework of other Human Right Dialogues, such as the
Tripartite Dialogue among EU, Tunisian authorities and Tunisian CSO
representatives, as well as during the Human Rights Dialogues with other third
states such as Brazil (2014) and Moldova (2016).
