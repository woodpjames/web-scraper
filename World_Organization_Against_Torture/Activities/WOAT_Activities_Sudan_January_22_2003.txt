Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Sudanese Organisation Against Torture, a member of the OMCT network, of the arbitrary and incommunicado detention and corresponding risk of torture faced by Mr. Donato Dimo Wol in Sudan.  According to the information received, at 10.00pm on 15 January 2003, members of the security forces arrested Mr Donato Dimo Wol, the President of the Southern Sudanese Student Unions of Bahr Algazal University. Mr. Donato Dimo Wol is a student at the university’s Faculty of Education.   Mr. Donato Dimo Wol was taken from his house in Alhaj Yousif, in Khartoum North. He has been taken to an unknown location. The security forces accused Mr. Donato Dimo Wol of being one of the organisers of student demonstrations that took place in October 2002.   The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned for Mr. Donato Dimo Wol’s personal integrity, given that his whereabouts are not currently known and that he runs a significant risk of being subjected to torture, notably since many other students who have been arrested recently who were involved in the October demonstrations have allegedly been subjected to torture by the Sudanese authorities.  OMCT calls on the Sudanese authorities to immediately locate Mr. Donato Dimo Wol’s whereabouts, guarantee his physical and psychological integrity and order his unconditional release.  Action requested  Please write to the authorities in Sudan urging them to:  i.	take all necessary measures to guarantee Mr Donato Dimo Wol’s physical and psychological integrity; ii.	immediately locate Mr Donato Dimo Wol’s whereabouts; iii.	intervene with the appropriate authorities in order to secure that Mr Donato Dimo Wol  is allowed to meet with his relatives and legal representation; iv.	order Mr Donato Dimo Wol’s immediate and unconditional release; v.	guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout Sudan in accordance with international human rights standards.
