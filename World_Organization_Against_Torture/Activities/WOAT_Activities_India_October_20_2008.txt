New Information The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by Banglar Manabadhikar Suraksha Mancha (MASUM), a member of OMCT SOS-Torture network, about the unlawful detention and the threats faced by Mr. Sentu Mondal’s father, Mr. Ershad Mondal, in order to withdraw the complaint he had lodged following his son’s death. According to the information received, on 14 August 2008, Mr. Ershad Mondal lodged a petition under section 156 (3) of the Indian Code of Criminal Procedure (order to investigate) with the Chief Judicial Magistrate (CJM), Berhampore, Murshidabad, as no investigation had been launched against the alleged Border Security Force (BSF) perpetrators, including Mr. Ganeshan, D.I.B. of Singhpara BSF Camp, Battalion no.90, Company-C. The Court reportedly accepted the petition and ordered the Jalangi Police Station to investigate into the events. The police eventually opened a case, and later summoned the witnesses to the event, namely Mr. Kuran Mandal, Mr. Kazim Mandal, Mr. Tamirul Mandal and Mr. Uttam Mandal, all resident of Chakmathura village, to the police station on 11 October 2008 at 8:00am. Once all were at the police station, they were reportedly violently detained and verbally insulted by Mr. Tuhin Biswas, Sub-Inspector of Jalangi Police Station. He reportedly threatened them to withdraw the petition against the BSF. All five remained detained for 12 hours, allegedly without water or food. It is further reported that Sub-Inspector Mr. Tuhin Biswas already had visited Mr. Ershad Mondal at his house and threatened him to withdraw the case before he later summoned the witnesses. The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned about these events and calls on the authorities to ensure that adequate protection is granted to Mr. Ershad Mondal and the witnesses against ill-treatment or intimidation as a consequence of the complaint or any evidence given. OMCT wishes to reiterate is concern with regard to the death in BSF custody of Mr. Sentu Mondal, the alleged torture and ill-treatment, and the reported lack of proper investigation into the events. OMCT recalls that “Every human being has the inherent right to life. This right shall be protected by law. No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his life” as stipulated in article 6 1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. OMCT calls on the authorities to order a thorough, independent and impartial investigation into the circumstances of this death, in order to identify those responsible, bring them to trial and apply the penal and/or administrative sanctions as provided by law. Furthermore, OMCT calls on the authorities to ensure that the Border Security Force Act (1968) and the Border Security Force Rules (1969) comply with international human rights treaties as well as take into account the Declaration of Basic Principles of Justice for Victims of Crime and Abuse of Power and the Basic Principle and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation for Victims of Gross Violations of International Human Rights Law and Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law. Brief reminder of the situation OMCT had been informed about the death in Border Security Force (BSF) custody of Mr. Sentu Mondal, 19 year old residing at village-Chakmathura, District-Murshidabad, in West Bengal. According to the information received, on 17 June 2008 around 11pm, Mr. Sentu Mondal was arrested by BSF officials near Out-Post no. 1 of Udaynagar Colony after having been caught smuggling cattle. While the other individuals involved along with him in the smuggling managed to flee, Mr. Sentu Mondal was reportedly brought to the BSF Out-Post no. 1. There, he was reportedly so severely beaten (including causing severe injuries to his genitals) by BSF, including Mr. Ganeshan, D.I.B. of Singhpara BSF Camp, Battalion no.90, Company-C, that he lost consciousness in front of Out-Post no. 1. Mr. Sentu Mondal’s body was allegedly later drowned in Padma River, near Out-Post no. 1. According to the same information, on 19 June 2008 at around 4pm, Mr. Sentu Mondal’s body was recovered from the river.
