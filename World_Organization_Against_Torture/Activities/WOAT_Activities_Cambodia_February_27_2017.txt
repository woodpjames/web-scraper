The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint partnership
of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and FIDH, has received new
information and requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in
Cambodia.
 
New information:
 
The
Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the sentencing of land
rights defender Ms. Tep
Vanny.
 
According to
the information received, on February 23, 2017, the Phnom Penh Municipal Court
convicted Ms. Tep Vanny on charges of “intentional violence with aggravated
circumstances” (Article 218 of the Criminal Code) and sentenced her to two years and six months’
imprisonment for participating in a protest held by members of the Boeung Kak Lake
community in March 2013 in front of Prime Minister Hun Sen’s house in Phnom
Penh. Ms. Tep Vanny
was also ordered to pay a fine of five million riel (about EUR 1,150), as well
as compensation payments of four million riel (about EUR 920) to the first
plaintiff and five million riel to the second plaintiff, both of whom are
members of Daun Penh district para-police. During the trial, no credible
evidence was presented to either justify the charges brought against Ms. Tep
Vanny or to prove that any violence was committed against the para-police.
 
Ms.
Tep Vanny’s trial before Phnom Penh Municipal Court was due to be held on
February 3, 2017 but resumed only on February 23, after
nearly three weeks’ postponement.
 
The
Observatory recalls that this case is just one of
three cases which were re-activated in August 2016 while Ms. Tep Vanny was
awaiting trial on separate charges stemming from her participation in a
peaceful ‘Black Monday’ protest (see background information). Ms. Tep Vanny has
remained in pre-trial detention since August 2016 in Prey Sar’s Correctional
Centre 2 (CC2) prison in Phnom Penh.
 
The
Observatory strongly condemns Ms. Tep Vanny’s sentencing and ongoing arbitrary
detention, which only aims at sanctioning her legitimate human rights
activities, and calls upon the Cambodian authorities to
immediately and unconditionally release her.
 
The Observatory is also concerned that para-police
violently dispersed a group of supporters who had peacefully gathered outside the Phnom Penh Municipal
Court to show solidarity with Ms. Tep Vanny. Para-police
tried to forcibly disperse the supporters. When the supporters resisted the
violent removal, para-police attacked them and dragged them across the floor,
injuring three women.
 
Background information:
 
Ms. Tep
Vanny played a prominent role in mobilising communities around Boeung Kak Lake
to fight against an eviction order agreed upon by the Government and a private
corporation, in order for the corporation to carry out development plans which
would include filling 90% of the lake to build tourism infrastructure. She is
one of the 13 women human rights defenders (the Boeung Kak 13) who were charged
and sentenced to two years and six months’ imprisonment in 2012 as a result of
their work resisting these development plans.
 
On August
15, 2016, Ms. Tep Vanny and Ms. Bov
Sophea, another defender from the Boeung Kak Lake community, were
arrested while participating in a peaceful protest
held by the Boeung Kak Lake community in Phnom Penh to mark the 15th
week of the ‘Black Monday’ campaign. The campaign involved weekly peaceful
protests, held on Mondays, where participants wore black clothing to call for
the release of human rights defenders Messrs. Ny Sokha, Yi Soksan, Nay Vanda, Ny Chakrya, and Ms. Lim Mony,
as well as for justice for the murder of prominent political analyst and ‘Black
Monday’ supporter Kem Ley[1].
 
Following their arrest, Ms. Tep Vanny and Ms. Bov Sophea were
initially detained at the Daun Penh district police station before being sent
to pre-trial detention in Prey Sar’s CC2 prison in Phnom Penh on August 17,
2016.
 
On
August 17, 2016, both were charged with “incitement” under
Article 495 of Cambodia’s Criminal Code, after a day of interrogation at the
Phnom Penh Municipal Court. They were immediately sent to trial, which was
adjourned until August 22, 2016.
 
On August
22, 2016, following a 90-minute trial and after just 18 minutes of
deliberation, presiding Judge Pech Vicheator unexpectedly changed the charge to
“insult of a public official” (Article 502 of the Criminal Code) during the
delivery of his verdict. After presenting a defence against the original charge
of incitement, the defendants’ lawyers were given no opportunity to prepare a
defence against the new charge. The two
activists were convicted of “insulting a public official” and sentenced
to six days in prison.
 
While Ms.
Bov Sophea was released on the evening of August 22, 2016 after having served
six days in detention, Ms. Tep Vanny was brought back to CC2 prison, after an
additional charge had been brought against her. On August 19, 2016, the Phnom
Penh Municipal Court had charged her with “intentional violence with
aggravating circumstances”. The charge stemmed from Ms. Tep Vanny’s
participation in a protest near Prime Minister Hun Sen’s house in March 2013 to
call for the release of then-jailed activist Ms. Yorm Bopha[2]. The protest turned
violent when State security forces beat 10 of the activists and pushed others
into police trucks.
 
On September 19, 2016, Presiding Judge Ly Sokleng sentenced Ms. Tep Vanny and three other Boeung Kak Lake community
representatives, Ms. Bo Chhorvy, Ms.
Kong Chantha, and Ms. Heng Mom, to six
months’ imprisonment after a three-hour hearing at the Phnom Penh Municipal
Court. The four defenders were found guilty of “obstruction of a public
official with aggravating circumstances” and “insult” relating to a November
2011 protest that turned violent when police and security guards were sent in
to disperse demonstrators[3].
Ms. Tep Vanny was sent back to pre-trial detention in CC2 prison due to her
separate charges stemming from her participation in the 2013 protest. Ms. Bo
Chhorvy, Ms. Kong Chantha, and Ms. Heng Mom, who was tried in absentia, were
not arrested as all appeals had not been exhausted.
 
On January
25, 2017, Supreme Court Judge Kim Sathavy rejected
Ms. Tep Vanny’s second appeal for bail.

Please
write to the authorities of Cambodia asking them to:
 
i. Guarantee in

as provided by the law;
 
iv. Put
an end to all acts of harassment - including at the judicial level - against Ms. Tep Vanny and
all human rights defenders in Cambodia so that they are able to carry out their
work without hindrance or fear of reprisals;

The Observatory for the Protection of Human
Rights Defenders (the Observatory) was created in 1997 by the World
Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and FIDH. The objective of this programme
is to prevent or remedy situations of repression against human rights
defenders. OMCT and FIDH are both members of ProtectDefenders.eu, the
European Union Human Rights Defenders Mechanism implemented by international
civil society.  




[1] The Boeung
Kak Lake community in Phnom Penh is one of the co-implementing partners of the
#FreeThe5KH campaign, launched on August 8, 2016, by civil society groups in
support of the five human rights defenders who are currently in pre-trial
detention and under judicial investigation for allegations of bribery, and who have now spent over 100 days in prison. For
more information, see www.freethe5kh.net as well as Joint Press Releases, issued on July
13, 2016 and January 21, 2017.

Release, issued on September 4, 2013.


[3] During the 2011 protest, the activists were demanding that
94 Boeung Kak Lake families be included in a land plot that Prime Minister Hun
Sen had promised to set aside for displaced members of the community. Violence broke out when police blocked about 100 women from
walking
towards Monivong
Boulevard.
