According to the information received, on Friday 18 January 2002, in the area known as Agua Zarcas, situated at the entry of the El Dorado urban district, different soldiers, belonging to the 7th Brigade of Albán Battalion, had established a checkpoint. According to the report, at 11:45 a.m., soldiers stopped the Transportes Meta bus n. 027 (taxmeta) coming from Villavicencio, and forced two young persons (a young man and a girl) off  the bus detained them. The young girl detained, Johana Bustos, lives in the La Macarena area, in the Medellín district of Arriari, municipality of El Castillo. To date, the name of the other person detained is still unknown.  According to the report the detained persons were kept  there until 4:00 p.m., when the checkpoint was lifted,  and forced into a four  door red car which drove off in the direction of Cubarral. According to the information, the two persons tried to escape, but only the young man succeded. So far, the whereabouts of Johana Vargas Bustos, still remain unknown.  According to the information, on 19 January 2002, Johana Vargas Bustos’ family  went to the office of the mayor of El Castillo, who in tern called the mayor of El Dorado and asked him information concerning Johana Vargas Bustos. The Mayor of El Dorado replied “ everyone had been detained the day before, was released  at 4:00 p.m and I don’t have any information about Johana Vargas Bustos”.   The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned for the security and the physical and psychological integrity of Johana Vargas Bustos.  Background information  According to the information, in the Alto Ariari region the soldiers of 7th Brigade, Albán Battalion, have been carrying out operations against the guerrilla forces. On Friday 11 January 2002, many soldiers arrived at the Medellín del Ariari district, in El Castillo, where they harassed locals, accusing them of collaborating with the guerrilla forces. At 10:35 a.m the soldiers set up a military checkpoint at the exit of the town, in the direction of El Castillo,  and they blocked the cars for one hours approximately.  According to the information, at 12:00 the soldiers left the village and at 12:30 and burst of machine gun were heard for roughly 15 minutes.  The shots came from the region of the cemetery and a bullet reached one of the houses in the neighbourhood. Since this episode soldiers have not returned to the village.  The information also mentioned that the same day, on 11 January 2002, the bus which usually arrives from Villavicencio to Puerta Esperanza district, in El Castillo, was blocked by paramilitaries near the Cubarral municipality. The paramilitaries confiscated the deliveries (food), claiming that the food was for the guerrilla.  From this moment the paramilitaries have been maintaining a checkpoint of all the deliveries to el Castillo. The cars transporting vegetables, cannot enter the village without  paying a fine of 25.000 pesos imposed by the paramilitaries. The information has pointed out that although the militaries, belonging to the 7 brigade, maintain a permanent control in the region situated between the cross-road of Cubarral and the El Dorado municipality, the paramilitaries have exercised restrictions. For example, on 20 January 2002 in the morning, the cars which usually transport vegetables and goods, could not enter Cubarral district due to the blockade by the paramilitaries.
