The Observatory for the Protection of Human
Rights Defenders, a partnership of the World Organisation Against Torture
(OMCT) and FIDH, requests your urgent intervention in the following situation
in Egypt.
Description of the Situation:
The Observatory has been informed by reliable
sources about the travel ban imposed on Ms. Aida Seif El-Dawla, Director
and one of the founders of El Nadeem Center for the Rehabilitation of Victims
of Torture and Violence.
According to the information received, on
November 23, 2016 Ms. Seif El-Dawla was informed by airport officials about the
travel ban imposed against her. When she asked for explanation she was told to
go ask the Prosecution for the reasons of this ban, since she is “either a
defendant or wanted [to testify] in a criminal case”. No more information was
given to her.
The Observatory recalls that both the
imposition of travel bans and of assets freezes against human rights defenders
and organisations is a common pattern of harassment increasingly used by the
Egyptian authorities against human rights defenders in the country.[1] 
Moreover, the decision to impose a travel ban
on El Nadeem Center’s Director comes at a time of rising government pressure on
independent human rights groups in Egypt, in the context of a dramatic
deterioration of the human rights situation in the country, marked namely by a
grave crackdown on civil society and a notable increase in cases of torture,
deaths in detention and enforced disappearances.
The Observatory is extremely concerned about
this new act of harassment against a member of El-Nadeem Center, only one week
after an attempt to freeze the Center’s assets  under administrative order[2] (the order
was reversed on November 14, 2016), as these actions only aims at sanctioning
their legitimate human rights activities. Moreover, earlier this year El Nadeem
Center has been repeatedly threatened with closure order by the Egyptian
authorities[3].
The Observatory urges the
Egyptian authorities to immediately and unconditionally lift the travel ban
against Aida Seif El-Dawla and put an end to all acts of harassment against El
Nadeem Center as well as against all human rights organisations in the country,
and to comply with its constitutional obligations (in particular Article 78 and
Article 93 of the 2014 Egyptian Constitution which respectively recognise the
right to freedom of association and Egypt’s compliance with international human
rights conventions ratified by Egypt) as well as its international legal
obligations (in particular Article 22 of the International Covenant on Civil
and Political Rights – ICCPR).
Actions requested:
Please write to the authorities of Egypt
asking them to:
i.
Guarantee in all circumstances Ms. Seif El-Dawla’s freedom of movement, by immediately and unconditionally lifting the
travel ban imposed against her, as it aims only at sanctioning her legitimate
human rights activities;
ii. Put an end to all forms of harassment
against El Nadeem Center as well as against all human rights organisations and
defenders in Egypt;
iii. Comply with all the provisions of the
United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, in particular with
Article 1; Article 5(b) and Article 12.2.
iv. Ensure in all circumstances respect for
human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human
rights standards and international instruments ratified by Egypt.
