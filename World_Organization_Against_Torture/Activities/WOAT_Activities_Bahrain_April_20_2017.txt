Our organisations write to urge you to reiterate
Bahrain’s obligations under the Convention Against Torture («the Convention») and
give
immediate attention to:




           the systematic
use of torture against political detainees ;       the use of
torture to obtain false confessions ;       reliance
upon evidence obtained through torture to achieve convictions, including death
sentences ;       the refusal
to investigate allegations of torture in detention facilities;       the
deteriorating conditions of detention for activists and Human Rights Defenders;       the government’s continued refusal to ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention Against
Torture («OPCAT») and allow the UN Special Rapporteur on torture to visit the
country.Next week, Bahraini authorities will appear before your Committee in Geneva, as part of the Committee’s regular review of
the Bahraini government’s record under the Convention. Over the years, Bahrain’s government has failed to implement most of the CAT’s recommendations, especially those related to its systematic failure to hold
torturers accountable, particularly members of the security forces. By specifically
pushing
the Bahraini delegation to acknowledge the systematic use of torture, you would be making a valuable
contribution toward genuine
accountability for torture victims in Bahrain.
As documented by our organisations, torture is a
constant presence in Bahrain’s judicial system, used systematically to coerce confessions
during pre-trial interrogations and threaten and punish detainees whilst they
are imprisoned in detention facilities. The Bahraini government has launched an
intensified crackdown on civil society in the past year, and in January it
broke a seven-year executions
moratorium by executing three torture victims, all of whom were convicted based
on confessions they claimed
were extracted through torture. 
Moreover, the Bahraini
human rights institutions purportedly tasked with carrying out independent and
Istanbul Protocol-compliant investigations of torture complaints have instead
done the opposite,
acting to cover up torture allegations and refusing to investigate them. This
continues to exacerbate
the near-total impunity afforded to
members of Bahraini security forces accused of torture. Compounding this
culture of impunity is the refusal of Bahrain’s European allies, some of whom
have invested millions in the training of these human rights institutions, to
acknowledge that such technical assistance and international support should be
made conditional upon demonstrable improvements in torture accountability—such as
ratifying OPCAT and allowing a visit by the Special Rapporteur on torture.These developments demonstrate how important it
is for the Committee to urge Bahrain to acknowledge and address the
country’s abysmal record on torture. Specifically, we ask that you urge the
Bahraini government to:- Take immediate action to halt the inhumane treatment and harassment of detained human
rights defenders and activists like Abdulhadi Al -Khawaja[1] and Nabeel Rajab[2];- Provide information about the
treatment of Mr Al-Khawaja and Mr Rajab;- Immediately stay all death
sentences in cases where the accused alleges he was tortured into providing a
false confession, pending full investigation by an independent body;- Establish new, demonstrably
independent accountability mechanisms empowered to conduct
investigations into allegations of torture and other ill-treatment of detainees
and prisoners, with the recognition that
future international support will be linked to Bahrain’s ratification
of OPCAT and agreement to a visit from the UN Special Rapporteur on torture
