New information: The Observatory has been informed by the Human Rights Association (İnsan Haklari Derneği - İHD) that Ms. Filiz Kalayci, a lawyer and İHD Executive Committee member who remains arbitrarily detained since May 28, 2009, was summoned to appear before the 11th District High Criminal Court of Ankara on November 9, 2009 at 10 am. The Observatory recalls that Ms. Filiz Kalayci was arrested on May 28, 2009 on the basis of an allegation of “aiding illegal organisations" (See background information). Since then, she has remained detained in the women prison of Ankara. The Observatory calls upon the Turkish authorities to release Ms. Filiz Kalayci, immediately and unconditionally as her detention seems to merely aim at sanctioning her human rights activities, and therefore contravenes the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 9, 1998. Besides the Observatory urges the Delegation of the European Commission in Ankara and embassies of European Union member States to attend the hearing due to take place before the 11th District High Criminal Court of Ankara on November 9, 2009 at 10 am, in accordance with the Guidelines of the European Union on Human Rights Defenders. Background information: On May 12, 2009, in Ankara, the offices and homes of Ms. Filiz Kalayci, Mr. Hasan Anlar, Mr. Halil İbrahim Vargün and Mr. Murat Vargün, lawyers linked to IHD and involved in the defence of the rights of prisoners, were raided by officers of the Anti-Terror Unit of the police, who were in possession of a search warrant and a detention order against them. They were immediately arrested, placed in police custody in the Anti-Terror Forces Unit detention centre, and released in the night of May 14, 2009. According to their lawyers, the Public Prosecutor brought Ms. Filiz Kalayci, Mr. Hasan Anlar, Mr. Halil Ibrahim Vargun and Mr. Murat Vargun before the 11th District High Criminal Court of Ankara and requested that they be remanded in detention. However, the court decided to release Ms. Filiz Kalayci, Mr. Hasan Anlar, Mr. Halil Ibrahim Vargun and Mr. Murat Vargun, but imposed a travel ban on them, on the basis of Article 109 of the Code of Criminal Procedure or CMK No. 5271 dated 2004, which is still in force except for Mr. Murat Vargun. The Public Prosecutor appealed the decision, and issued a warrant of arrest against Ms. Filiz Kalayci on May 25, 2009. On May 28, 2009, Ms. Filiz Kalayci was arrested on the basis of an allegation of “aiding illegal organisations". These arrests intervened after the publication by İHD of a report on human rights violations in prisons of Turkey on February 6, 2009 and made it public to draw attention on these violations. İHD had shared this report with the authorities. In addition, Ms. Filiz Kalayci, Mr. Hasan Anlar, Mr. Halil İbrahim Vargün and Mr. Murat Vargün had been working on cases of human rights violations that occurred in detention, and as a consequence they often received letters of complaint from prison inmates.
