Brief description of the situation The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by The Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy (TCHRD), a member of OMCT SOS-Torture network, about the enforced disappearance of Mr. Wangdue (one name only), a Tibetan HIV/AIDS activist, since 14 March 2008. According to the information received, the whereabouts of Mr. Wangdue remain unknown to his family members since he was arbitrarily arrested by the Lhasa City Public Security Bureau (PSB) officials from his home on 14 March 2008 in Lhasa. No reason for his arrest was reportedly given to his family. According to the same information, Mr. Wangdue is a former political prisoner initially arrested for his involvement in the March 1989 protest in Lhasa and was later sentenced to three years to Re-education Through Labour (RTL) in Sangyip prison. His prison sentence was further increased by four years by the Lhasa city Intermediate People’s Court for his involvement in a protest in Sangyip, and he was later transferred to the notorious Drapchi prison in Lhasa where he completed his prison term. Mr. Wangdue was released in 1995. Mr. Wangdu reportedly later came in contact with the Burnet Institute, an Australian NGO working on an HIV/AIDS awareness program in Lhasa city and worked to create HIV/AIDS awareness in various brothels around Lhasa city, in schools in neighbouring counties and towns, and organised talk series in various nightclubs mushrooming in the holy city. In March 2008, a severe crackdown by Chinese security forces had followed protests in Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) and Tibetan areas of neighbouring provinces. The peaceful protests had started on 10 March 2008, when monks had demanded the easing of a government-imposed campaign which forces monks to write denunciations of the Dalai Lama and subjects them to government political propaganda. The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned for the safety of Mr. Wangdue as his whereabouts remain unknown, giving rise to fears that he may be subjected to ill-treatment, torture or potentially extra-judicial execution. OMCT calls on the authorities to immediately locate his whereabouts and guarantee his personal integrity at all times. OMCT recalls that China is a State party to the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment which prohibits torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. OMCT urges the authorities to conform with China’s international human rights obligations, commitments that were reaffirmed on the occasion of its election as a member of the United Nations Human Rights Council. Actions Requested Please write to the authorities in the People’s Republic of China urging them to:   Immediately locate the whereabouts of Mr. Wangdue as well as guarantee, in all circumstances, his physical and psychological integrity;  Guarantee immediate and unconditional access to legal representation, his family and any medical treatment he may require;  Order his immediate release in the absence of valid legal charges that are consistent with international law and standards, or, if such charges exist, bring him before an impartial, independent, competent and fair tribunal and guarantee his procedural rights at all times;  Order a thorough and impartial investigation into these events in order to identify all those responsible, bring them to trial and apply the penal and/or administrative sanctions as provided by law;  Guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
