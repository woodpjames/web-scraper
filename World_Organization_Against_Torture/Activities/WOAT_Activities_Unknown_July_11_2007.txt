According to the information received, on July 10, 2007, Mr. Mansour Osanloo was abducted by unidentified assailants as he was leaving a Vahed Company bus near his home at around 7 pm. According to witnesses, Mr. Osanloo’s assailants beat him severely, and continued to beat him as they took him away in a metallic grey Peugeot to an undisclosed location. Mr. Osanloo had apparently been followed all day by the unmarked Peugeot car. Such vehicles are well known as being associated with the Iranian Security Forces.  The Observatory expresses its deep concern for the safety of Mr. Osanloo and fears that his abduction might be directly linked to his trade union activities. As a matter of fact, Mr. Osanloo and leaders of Sherkate Vahed are regularly subjected to acts of reprisals (See Observatory Annual Report 2006 and background information). In addition, only a week ago, Mr. Ebrahim Madadi, Vice President of the union, was detained for a short period by the police before being released following global trade union protests. Background information: On August 9, 2006, Mr. Mansoor Osanloo, who was detained in the Evin prison (Tehran) since December 22, 2005, was released after being detained incommunicado for more than seven months in the Evin prison. His release was reportedly conditional on a 150 million toman bail (125,000 euros), which was paid by his colleagues, friends and family. On November 8, 2006, Mr. Osanloo was once again detained for several hours by the Tabriz police, along with nine representatives of Sherkat-e Vahed. At the time, they were on their way to Tabriz for a workshop organised by the International Labour Organisation. On November 19, 2006, Mr. Osanloo and Mr. Ebrahim Madadi were arrested on the street by policemen in plain clothes. The policemen refused to show their police card or an arrest warrant. Both men were on their way to the Ministry of Labour in Tehran and were allegedly physically and verbally assaulted by the policemen. One of them reportedly pointed a gun towards Mr. Madadi, before firing in the air. The officers finally forced Mr. Osanloo to get into their car and left. Mr. Osanloo was placed in detention in section 209 of the Evin prison, which is reserved for prisoners accused of political offences. He was unable to get access to his lawyer before December 5, 2006. On November 26, 2006, Mr. Osanloo appeared before the 14th Chamber of the Revolutionary Court along with 17 other trade unionists to answer the pending charges against him, the exact nature of which was not known. A few days later, the Minister of Justice and the spokesperson for the Ministry reportedly declared that Mr. Osanloo had been arrested again for not reporting to the penitentiary authorities after the issue of an arrest warrant and summons. However, his lawyer certified that Mr. Osanloo never received a warrant or summons requiring him to return to prison, but only a summons requiring his presence at a hearing before the fourth chamber of the Special Civil Servants Court on November 20, 2006. On December 5, 2006, the judge set an additional bail of 30 million toman for his release (his bail then amounting to about 150,000 euros), stating that only his wife was authorised to pay it. On December 19, 2006, Mr. Osanloo was finally released after only paying 150 million toman in bail, which was related to his detention from December 22, 2005 and August 9, 2006.
