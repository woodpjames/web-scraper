Brief description of the situation: The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Committee of Human Rights Observers (Comité des observateurs des droits de l’homme - CODHO) and the African Association for the Protection of Human Rights (Association africaine de défense des droits de l’homme - ASADHO), members of the SOS torture network, of the kidnapping of Reverend Khutino Fernando by members of the security service of the national Congolese police, under the command of Colonel Raus, in Kinshasa.  According to the information received, on 14 May 2006, Reverend Khutino Fernando was kidnapped by members of the security police said to be from “Kin Maziere” while he was at the office of his Church "Army of the victory" (Armée de la victoire), located in the municipality of Kasa-Vubu, after having participated in a religious service at the stadium “Tata Raphaël”, municipality of Kalamu. During his kidnapping, Mr. Khutino Fernando was brutalised and threatened with dead. He was furthermore undressed. The place and the conditions of the place of detention of Reverend Khutino Fernando remain unknown.  During the sermon that he had held in the stadium, Reverend Khutino Fernando called upon the main political actors to prevent a political crisis that might arise with the end of the transition that is planned for 30 June 2006. Indeed, according to the elections calendar that was issued by the independent electoral commission, the election should begin on 30 July 2006 and the transition will not end anymore on 30 June 2006 as scheduled by the constitution of transition.   In the evening of the same day the governor of Kinshasa, Mr. Kimbembe Mazunga, accused on the public television channel RTNC (National Radio–Television of Congo - Radio-Télévision Nationale du Congo) Mr. Khutino of calling for, while preaching, hate and division. He also reported to have found weapons in the house of the Reverend.    Reverend Khutino Fernando came back from Europe only on 6 May 2006 after an exile of three years in France. He had fled the country in the same circumstances, because of death threats he received.  On 15 May 2006, a march was organised in Kinshasa by the followers of Reverend Khutino Fernando as well as by others who protested against his illegal arrest, as well as against ill-treatment, death treats and acts of violence against the followers of his church. The demonstrators, who were heading towards the cabinet of the vice-president of the Republic, Mr. Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo, were violently dispersed by members of the national police, who used firearms as well as teargas. Several followers of Mr. Khutino Fernando would have been arrested.  The International Secretariat of OMCT expresses its grave concern over the kidnapping and over the continuing risk of torture of Reverend Khutino Fernando, and calls on the Congolese government to launch thorough and impartial investigation into these events. Action requested:Please write to the Congolese authorities and ask them to: 1.	Locate the whereabouts of Reverend Kuthino Fernando and guarantee his physical and psychological integrity; 2.	Order his immediate release in the absence of valid legal charges,  or if such charges exist, ensure that he is given a prompt and fair trial, in which his procedural rights are guaranteed at all time; 3.	Order a thorough and impartial investigation into these events, in order to identify all those responsible, bring them to trial and apply to them the civil, penal and/or administrative sanctions provided by law; 4.	Guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
