The Observatory for the
Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the International
Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation Against Torture
(OMCT), requests your urgent intervention in the following
situation in the Iran.
 
Description of the situation:
 
The Observatory has been
informed by the Iranian League for the Defence of Human Rights (LDDHI) about
the arbitrary detention and judicial harassment of Mr. Saeed Madani, an
Iranian sociologist and human rights activist. 
 
According to the
information received, on February 19, 2014, Branch 54 of the Appeals Court
upheld a first-instance decision issued in June 2013 by Branch 26 of Islamic
Revolution Court to sentence Mr. Saeed Madani to six-year imprisonment (two
years in Evin prison in Tehran, and four years in exile in Bandar Abbas prison,
although exile in prison does not exist in Iranian law) as well as to 10-year
life exile in Bandar Abbas, a city 1,500 km away from Tehran, which is Mr.
Madani’s home town. Mr. Madani is currently detained in Ward 350 of Evin prison
in Tehran.
 
Mr. Madani was sentenced
for collaborating with organisations such as the Defenders of Human Rights
Centre (DHRC) - whose offices were shut down in 2008 -, and for having
published books and articles drawing a dark picture of social conditions in
Iran.
 
Mr. Madani was arrested on
January 7, 2012, probably on the pretext of his previous conviction in 2003 in
order to serve the remainder of his sentence (see below), and spent one year in
Detention Centre 209 of the Ministry of Intelligence, in Tehran. He suffered
prolonged solitary confinement and was denied contact with his family or
lawyer. He was transferred to Ward 350 of Evin prison for one day in early July
2012 and for five days in November 2012, before being returned to Detention
Centre 209. On December 16, 2012, he was transferred for the third time to Ward
350 where he completed his sentence in January 2014. However, he has been kept
in Ward 350 since then, reportedly on the basis of the new above-mentioned
sentence.
 
Mr. Saeed Madani has been
detained several times since 1994 for his work as a sociologist and for his
collaboration with Iranian human rights organisations. In early 2003, he was
sentenced to a six-year imprisonment and a 10-year ban on social activities.
The prison sentence was then reduced to three and a half years and the 10-year
ban was upheld on appeal by Branch 29 of the Appeals Court. He had already
served one year of his sentence in pre-trial detention in 2000 and served the
rest from January 2012 to January 2014, when his sentence was completed.
 
The Observatory expresses its concern about the
decision of the Appeal Court to uphold the six-year prison and 10-year exile
sentence against Mr. Saeed Madani, as it merely aims at sanctioning his human
rights activities. The Observatory denounces this
decision as means to infringe freedom of expression in Iran, in violation of
international law. 
 
Actions requested:
 
Please
write to the Iranian authorities and ask them to:
 
i. Guarantee
in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Saeed
Madani, as well as of all human rights
defenders in Iran;
 
ii. Release Mr. Saeed Madani
immediately and unconditionally as his detention
is arbitrary since it only aims at sanctioning their human rights activities;
 
iii. Put
an end to any kind of harassment - including at the judicial level - against
Mr. Saeed Madani and all human rights defenders in Iran;
 
iv. Conform
in any circumstances with the provisions of the Declaration on Human Rights
Defenders, adopted on December 9, 1998 by the United Nations General Assembly,
in particular its article 1, which states that “everyone has the right,
individually or in association with others, to promote the protection and
realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and
international levels”, and its article 12.2 which provides that “the State
shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent
authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against
any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination,
pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her
legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”;
 
v. Ensure
in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in
accordance with international human rights standards and international
instruments ratified by Iran.
