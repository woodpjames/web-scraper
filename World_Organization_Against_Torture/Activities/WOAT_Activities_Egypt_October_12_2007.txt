New information: The Observatory has been informed by the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) about the sentencing of Mr. Kamal Abbas, General Coordinator of the Centre for Trade Unions and Workers Services (CTUWS), and his lawyer, Mr. Mohamed Helmy, following a lawsuit for alleged “slander and defamation of character”, which was filed against Mr. Abbas by Mr. Mohamed Ibrahim, Chairman of the board of directors of a youth centre in 15 May City (Cairo) and a member of the ruling National Democratic Party (NDP). According to the information received, on October 11, 2007, Mr. Kamal Abbas and Mr. Mohamed Helmy were sentenced to one year imprisonment by an Egyptian court. Both men were taken to court after publishing a report in the CTUWS magazine Kalam Sinai’ia (Workers’ Talk) about an investigation into financial and administrative irregularities in the running of the youth centre. The allegations of corruption against Mr. Ibrahim were in fact corroborated by an internal investigation conducted by the Youth Centre, whose Board of Directors was subsequently dissolved by the Governor of Cairo. The Observatory expresses its deep concern at the sentencing of Mr. Kamal Abbas and Mr. Mohamed Helmy, which seems to merely aim at sanctioning their human rights activities. To that extent, the Observatory recalls that several branches of CTUWS were closed down in March and April 2007 (See background information), then clearly violating freedom of association. The Observatory further recalls that according to the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 9, 1998, “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels” (Article 1) and “The State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the [...] Declaration” (Article 12.2). Background information: On March 29, 2007, the Naj-Hamadi section of the Centre for Trade Union and Workers Services (CTUWS), in the Qena Governorate (Upper Egypt), was closed down by an administrative decision issued by the Mayor of the town. The CTUWS section was in particular accused of inciting demonstrations and strikes that took place in the Delta region in December 2006 and January 2007, which CTUWS denied. Furthermore, on April 10, 2007, the Governor of El-Gharbiya ordered to shut down the CTUWS section in the town of Mahalla. Lastly, on April 22, 2007, the police went to the CTUWS headquarters in Helwan (Cairo) and ordered the closure of the office on the basis of an administrative order issued by the Ministry of Social Affairs. In addition, in recent months, the CTUWS has been targeted by a smear campaign organised by the Egyptian Trade Union Federation (ETUF), which has consistently accused CTUWS of inciting the workers’ strikes. Action requested: Please write to the Egyptian authorities and ask them to:  Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Kamal Abbas and Mr. Mohamed Helmy; Ensure that they be granted a fair and impartial trial when appealing their sentencing, so that the charges against them be dropped as they seem to merely sanction their human rights activities and as such are arbitrary; Put an end to all forms of harassment against CTUWS’ activities, repeal the administrative decision to close down its headquarters in Cairo and its two offices in Naj-Hamadi and Mahalla, and ensure in all circumstances that its members are able to carry out their work freely without any hindrances; Put an end to all forms of harassment against human rights defenders in Egypt; Conform with the provisions of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 9, 1998, in particular its above-mentioned Articles 1 and 12.1; Promote and ensure freedom of association in Egypt and ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by Egypt.
