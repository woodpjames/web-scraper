The Observatory for the Protection of Human
Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the  
World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and the International
Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), requests your urgent
intervention in
the following situation in The Philippines.
 
Description
of the situation
 
The
Observatory has been informed by reliable sources, including the Task Force
Detainees of the Philippines (TFDP), of the death
threats against Mr. Benito E. Molino,
a human rights defender who campaigned for an end to mining operations in
Zambales Province due to concerns over environmental degradation and the
negative impact on the community members’ health and livelihood. Mr. Molino has lately been at the
receiving end of criticism from supporters of mining companies in the province.
Some mine workers blamed him for the suspension of mining activities that cost
them their jobs.
 
According to
the information received, on October 28, 2014, Mr. Molino
received a death threat via a private message to his Facebook account, which
was posted by a certain Dexter Movilla, also known as Mark Minimo, on October
15, 2014 at 10:35 a.m. The message which was in Tagalog dialect read as
follows: "You’re a meddler. People
lose their jobs because of you. Keep in mind that one bullet can kill you.
Beware, one day you’re dead."
 
Another
message was sent on October 12, 2014 at 8:08 p.m. It was also in Tagalog and it
said: "People lose their jobs
because you coerced the mining company to stop. Do you know, because of what
you did, many are angry with you, you will not have peace because of what you
did, you stopped all mining operations."
 
The
Observatory strongly condemns these acts of harassment against Mr. Molino, and
calls upon the competent authorities to carry out a prompt,
effective, thorough, independent, and impartial investigation into the death
threats against Mr. Molinois harassment case, and ensure that adequate,
effective and prompt action protection is given to Mr. Molino.
 
Background information:
 
Mr. Molino
and his group, the Concerned Citizens of Sta. Cruz, Zambales (CCOS), has been
actively campaigning for an end to mining operations in Zambales Province  to concerns over environmental degradation and
the negative impact on the community members’ health and livelihoodthe vast
amount of destruction in the environment that would eventually affect the
health and livelihood of the people. 
According to Mr. Molino, nickel laterite (soil layer rich in nickel
compound) has clogged the natural flow of water from rivers, creeks, fishponds,
shorelines, and farmlands. Apparently, more than 300 hectares of farmlands have
already been destroyed which has caused farmers of Sta. Cruz and Candelaria great income losses.
 
On July 15, 2014, the Mines and Geosciences Bureau (MGB)
regional office in Central Luzon suspended the operations of four mining
companies that extract nickel laterite in Zambales Province, citing their “unsystematic
mining or stripping method.” And from what I understand, the suspension order
is only an initial victory for Sta. Cruz residents since they have been
struggling to revive their sources of livelihood, which are mostly farming and
fishing.
 
In addition
to his activities in the anti-mining movement, Mr. Molino is currently working
with the Medical Action Group (MAG), in partnership with the Task Force
Detainees of the Philippines (TFDP) for the protection of human rights
defenders in the country. Mr. Molino is an expert in medical investigation and
documentation of torture cases. and is also involved in the investigation and
documentation of alleged cases of enforced disappearances, particularly in
exhumations.
