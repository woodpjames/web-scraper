Brief description of the situation  The Observatory has just been informed by the Latin-American Commission on the Rights and Freedoms of Workers and Populations (CLADEHLT), a member of the OMCT network, of an attempt to assassinate Sr. Edwin Rafael Fuentes López, on  4th May 2000, and of the death threats uttered against him and Sres. José E. Pinzón and  Rigoberto Dueñas Morales; respectively Secretary-General and Deputy  Secretary- General of the Central General de los Trabajadores de Guatemala (CGTG).  According to the information, on 4th May 2000, Sr-Edwin Rafael Fuentes López, a trade union leader and representative of the workers of the Palo Gordo sugar factory, was the victim of an attempted assassination on the part of Mario Varcia, foreman of the above-mentioned sugar refinery.   The attempt having failed, its author proferred death threats against the trade-union leader.  The reports of the CLADEHLT also add that landholder circles on the South coast have threatened trade-union leaders Sres. José E. Pinzón and  Rigoberto Dueñas Morales with death.  The same reports attribute responsibility for this to Sres. Fermín Viejo, of the El Tesoro, S.A. and  San Román plant, and  Francisco Zúñiga Fumagally, of the San Rafael Panama and Ofelia, S.A. plant.    The Observatory shares the concern of CLADHELT for the safety and physical and psychological integrity of those who work to promote and defend human rights in Guatemala, including trade-unionists, especially the trade-union activists mentioned above.  Action requested  Please write to the Guatemalan authorities urging them to:  i.	adopt all necessary measures to guarantee the safety and physical and psychological integrity of Edwin Rafael Fuentes López, José E.  Pinzón and  Rigoberto Dueñas;  ii.	carry out a thorough and impartial investigation into the facts referred to above in order to identify those responsible, bring them to justice and impose upon them the penal and/or civil sanctions provided by law;   iii.	ensure the implementation of the provisions of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9th 1998, in particular the duty of the State to guarantee "...the protection by the competent  authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure  adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration."
