The International Secretariat of the World Organization Against Torture
(OMCT) requests your URGENT intervention in the following situation in Indonesia.
Brief description of the
situation
The International
Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by TAPOL, a member organisation of OMCT
SOS-Torture Network, about the arbitrary detention and torture of Mr. Alfares Kapisa and Mr. Yali Wenda, two students from Papua,
24 and 21 years old respectively, while participating in a demonstration at
Cenderawasih University in Jayapura demanding the unconditional release of Papuan
political prisoners and the opening of democratic space in Papua. 
According to the
information received, on 2 April 2014, the police arrested Mr. Yali Wenda,
member of Student Solidarity for Political Prisoners, and Mr. Alfares Kapisa,
field coordinator of the aforementioned demonstration. Mr. Yali Wenda and Mr.
Alfares Kapisa had approached the police to negotiate after the demonstration had
become tense. They were dragged into a Jayapura police crowd control truck,
where they were forced to lie facedown while they were beaten with rifle buts,
kicked with jackboots, and beaten with rattan sticks. Mr. Yali Wenda reported
that his head was beaten repeatedly against the truck and that his toes were
stamped on with jackboots. He also reported that when the police noticed that
he had a small wound on his foot, they stamped on it. The police also reportedly
administered electric shocks to the two men using electric stun batons. After
around 1.5 hours in the truck, Mr. Yali Wenda and Mr. Alfares Kapisa were
brought to the Jayapura police station. 
According to the same information
received, once at the police station, Mr. Yali Wenda and Mr. Alfares Kapisa
were taken to the criminal investigation unit (Reserse Kriminal, reskrim) and put in a cell. Afterwards, the
police called a doctor, who allegedly forced Mr. Kapisa and Mr. Wenda to hand
over their jackets and clothes which were covered with blood. The police
provided them with other clothes while their own ones were being washed clean.
Then, the doctor cleaned the wounds and stitched up the ear of Mr. Wenda with
three stitches without using any kind of anaesthetic, causing severe pain. It
is believed that Mr. Alfares Kapisa and Mr. Yali Wenda were tortured to deter
them from carrying out any further action critical to the government. 
On 3 April 2014, between 8
and 11 a.m. the police investigator at Jayapura police station interrogated Mr.
Alfares Kapisa and Mr. Yali Wenda. During the interrogation, the police reportedly
falsified the investigation report stating, among others, that Mr. Alfares
Kapisa and Mr. Yali Wenda had never been submitted to torture and that they had
attacked the police at the demonstration. They were also forced to sign a
statement that they would not carry out any other demonstrations. During their
detention, the authorities denied Mr. Kapisa and Mr. Wenda their right to access
a lawyer. 
On 3 April 2014, at noon, Mr.
Kapisa and Mr. Wenda were finally released and taken to Dian Harapan Hospital
in Waena, in Jayapura. At the time of issuing this urgent appeal, Mr. Kapisa
and Mr. Wenda were still receiving medical treatment. 
OMCT is also concerned
about information indicating that Mr. Yali Wenda has been intimidated on two
occasions by police intelligence agents since his release. 
The International Secretariat of OMCT expresses its
deep concern about the safety and physical and psychological integrity of Mr.
Alfares Kapisa and Mr. Yali Wenda, and urges the competent authorities to
guarantee their safety at all times, as well as to ensure that they receive
appropriate medical treatment and redress.  
OMCT recalls that the
authorities have to fulfil their obligations under international human
rights law to protect the right not to be subjected to torture or other
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and the right to liberty
and security, to consider seriously any allegations of ill-treatment and
arbitrary arrest, and to undertake a prompt, effective, thorough,
independent and impartial investigation in this regard, in order
to identify all those responsible, bring them to trial and apply adequate
sanctions. OMCT also recalls that victims must be ensured the right to an
effective remedy for the human rights violations suffered as well as the right
to full redress, including compensation and rehabilitation.
OMCT also urges the Indonesian authorities to guarantee
the rights to peaceful assembly and freedom of expression protected under the
Indonesian constitution and international law.
