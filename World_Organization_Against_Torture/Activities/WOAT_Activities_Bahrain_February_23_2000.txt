Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Bahrain Human Rights Organisation (BHRO), a member of the network, of the presumed arbitrary arrest of a student and arrest and fear of torture of seven others in Bahrain.  They have been identified as Seyyed Jalal Alawi Ahmed, Hassan Al Saqq'ai, Zuhair Al Sahir, Seyyed Hussain, Hussain Darwish, Seyed Hassan Adnan.  According to the information received, on 16th February 2000, security forces arrested Seyyed Jalal Alawi Ahmed, 19 years, a student at the University of Bahrain.  It is reported that security forces attacked his house at dawn, ransacking it and arresting him, as well as taking his computer and some personal possessions.  When the family enquired about him at Budaya police station, they were told that nothing was known of him as it was "Isa Town" police station that had arrested him.  The reason for his arrest is still unknown, although in light of his arrest by Isa Town Police, where some University buildings are, it is suspected that it may be because of Seyyed Jalal Alawi Ahmed's activities at his University.  Elsewhere, on the evening of Monday 14th February 2000, Hassan Al Saqq'ai, 23, Zuhair Al Sahir, 20, along with two other persons, were arrested in the Daih area and taken to Al-Khamis police station.  No reason was given for their arrest.  Other arrests have also reportedly taken place in the Daih and Karzakan area.  Amongst those persons, are Seyyed Hussain and Hussain Darwish, 23 and Seyed Hassan Adnan, 25.  There are fears that they are being subjected to torture and intimidation.  The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned for the physical and psychological integrity of these persons.  Action requested  Please write to the authorities in Bahrain urging them to:  i.	take all necessary measures to guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of the above-mentioned persons; ii.	order their immediate release in the absence of valid legal charges or, if such charges exist, bring them before an impartial and competent tribunal and guarantee their procedural rights at  all times; iii.	guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
