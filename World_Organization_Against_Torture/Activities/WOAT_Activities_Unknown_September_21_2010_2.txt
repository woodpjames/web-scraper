The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in Iran.
Description of the situation:
The Observatory has been informed of confirmation in appeal of the sentencing of Mr. Madjid Tavakoli, member of the student alumni group ADVAR TAHKIM, a pro-reform organisation involved in the defense of human rights.
According to the information received, on September 18, 2010, Mr. Madjid Tavakoli was sentenced in appeal to eight years and a half of imprisonment, including five years in prison for “participating in an illegal gathering”, one year for “propaganda against the system”; two years for “insulting the Supreme Leader” and six months for “insulting the President”[1].
Background information
On December 7, 2009, Mr. Madjid Tavakoli was arrested during the student protests over the disputed Presidential Election of 2009. His lawyer was not permitted to attend his trial, which took place in January 2010. Mr. Tavakoli was sentenced to five years in prison for “participating in an illegal gathering”, one year for “propaganda against the system”; two years for “insulting the Supreme Leader” and six months for “insulting the President”. The verdict also included a five-year ban on participating in political activities, as well as a ban on his leaving the country. In Evin Prison, he was held in solitary confinement on numerous occasions. On 22 June, he was moved to Section 350 of the prison, where conditions are said to be very poor.
Actions requested:
Please write to the Iranian authorities and ask them to:

 Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Madjid Tavakoli as well as all other union human rights defenders in Iran;
 Release Mr. Madjid Tavakoli immediately as his detention seems merely at punishing him for his human rights activities;
 Put an end to acts of harassment - including at the judicial level - against them as well as against all human rights defenders in Iran;
 Conform in any circumstances with the provisions of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted on December 9, 1998 by the United Nations General Assembly, in particular its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually or in association with others, to promote the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, its Article 5(c), which reads that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, at the national and international levels, [...] to communicate with non-governmental or intergovernmental organizations”, and its Article 12.2 which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”;
 Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by Iran.
