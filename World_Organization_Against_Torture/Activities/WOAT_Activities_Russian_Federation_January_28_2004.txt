Brief description of the situation:  The Observatory has been informed by the Information Centre of the Society of Russian-Chechen Friendship (SRCF), that Mr. Imran Ezhiev, a former kidnap victim and head of the Russian-Chechen Friendship Society's Information Centre in the Northern Caucasus and the regional coordinator of the Moscow Helsinki Group, has growing fears for his safety.   On January 26, 2004, Mr. Ezhiev told his colleagues at SRCF that unidentified individuals were watching his house and workplace in Ingushetia, where he currently lives. He also told SRCF’s staff that he was being followed by unidentified individuals driving four cars (a gray, 10-model "Zhiguli", two silvery "VAZ-21099" and a blur "VAZ-2107") that did not bear license plates. According to the information received, cars without license plates have been used in the past to kidnap Chechen refugees. The same sources report that “the fact that the road police don’t stop the car without any number plate proves the assumption that it might belong to the security service of the pro-Moscow president of Chechnya Akhmad Kadyrov.”  Mr. Ezhiev has been investigating the kidnapping and extra-judicial execution of Mr. Aslan Sheripovich Davletukaev, a SRCF volunteer documenting human rights abuses in Chechnya, who was kidnapped and executed by members of the armed forces of the Russian Federation at his residence in Chechnya. Mr. Davletukaev’s body was found on January 16, 2004, bearing evidence of torture and mutilation (see Observatory Urgent Appeal RUS 001/0104/OBS 006).   Background information:  On March 15, 2003, Mr. Imran Ezhiev was kidnapped in Chechnya by unidentified individuals wearing masks. Because of the appeals made by different international organizations, he was released on March 18, 2003. The kidnapping was allegedly related to the activities conducted by Mr. Ezhiev in the Shali district, where he gathered information for the annual SRCF report on human rights in Chechnya. He was also conducting research for OMCT on violations of economic, social and cultural rights in Chechnya, which was to be presented at the 31st session of the United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in November 2003 (see Observatory Urgent Appeal RUS 001/0303/OBS 012.1).  The Observatory strongly condemns these acts and calls on Russian authorities to fulfil their obligations under international and regional human rights standards, allow non-governmental organizations to freely continue their work in defending human rights and ensure their protection under any circumstances.  Actions requested:  Please write to Russian authorities urging them to:  i. guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Imran Ezhiev in all circumstances and put an end to the harassment directed towards all human rights defenders in Ingushetia and Chechnya, and ensure that they are allowed to carry out their work without hindrance;  ii. ensure the implementation of the provisions on the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders adopted by the UN general Assembly on December 9, 1998, in particular article 1, which states that “every person has the right, individually or collectively, to promote the protection and fulfilment of human rights and fundamental liberties at the national and international level”, as well as its article 12.2 which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats or retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”;  iii. guarantee the respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and other international instruments ratified by the Russian Federation.
