The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint
programme of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World
Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), has received new information and requests
your urgent intervention in the following situation in Bahrain.
 
New information:
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the
continuous travel ban of Mr. Nabeel
Rajab, President of the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights (BCHR),
FIDH Deputy Secretary General and a member of the Advisory Committee of Human
Rights Watch’s Middle East Division. 
According to the information received, on December 3, 2015, Mr. Rajab's lawyers submitted a second petition to
the Attorney General requesting the lift of the travel ban imposed on Mr.
Nabeel Rajab on July 13, 2015 (see background information). Previously, Mr.
Rajab’s lawyers had filed appeals to the travel ban with the investigating
prosecutor on September 2, 2015, the Attorney General on September 16, and the
Office of the Public Prosecution on October 1, 2015. They received no response
to such petitions.
 
In the written request filed to the Attorney
General, Mr. Rajab's lawyers raised the issue of urgency, as Mr. Rajab's wife
health is continuously deteriorating and needs treatment outside of Bahrain,
accompanied by Mr. Rajab. 
 
The Observatory denounces the continued travel ban imposed against Mr.
Nabeel Rajab and considers that Mr. Rajab is targeted solely for his human
rights activities. The Observatory calls on the Bahraini authorities to
immediately lift the travel ban, and drop all charges against Mr. Nabeel Rajab.

 
The Observatory, more generally, urges the Bahraini authorities to put
an end to all acts of harassment against Mr. Rajab, and to comply with
relevant international human rights standards and instruments, in particular
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of 1966, and the UN
Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the UN General Assembly on
December 9, 1998.
 
Background information:
 
Mr. Rajab has faced continuous judicial harassment for his
legitimate human rights work since his first arrest in June 2012.
Mr. Rajab was sentenced to three months imprisonment for allegedly
libelling the residents of Al Muharraq via several tweets posted on his twitter
account. On August 23, 2012, Mr. Nabeel Rajab was acquitted by the Higher
Appeal Court.
 
On August 16, 2012, the Lower Criminal Court sentenced Mr. Nabeel
Rajab to three years of imprisonment in relation to three cases related to his
participation in peaceful gatherings in favour of fundamental freedoms and
democracy. In December 2012, the Appeals Court reduced the sentence to two
years of imprisonment. Mr. Nabeel Rajab completed his sentence and was
released in May 2014.
 
On October 1, 2014, Mr. Nabeel Rajab was summoned and remanded in
detention by the General Directorate of Anti-corruption and Economic and
Electronic Security of the Criminal Investigation Department for “insulting a
public institution” under Article 216 of the Bahraini Penal Code. The case related to a tweet he published in September 2014, in which he
criticised the military institutions for generating extremist ideologies (the
“terrorism tweet” case). On November 2, 2014, the Third
Lower Criminal Court ordered Mr. Rajab’s release but barred him from leaving
the country.
 
On January 20, 2015, the Third Lower Criminal Court sentenced Mr. Nabeel
Rajab to six months imprisonment on the charges of “insulting public
institutions and the army”. 
 
In 2015, two other sets of criminal charges have been brought against
Mr. Rajab. On February 26, 2015, Mr. Rajab was summoned for investigations
for charges of “inciting hatred towards the regime” in relation to a speech he
made in February 2011 during a funeral (the “funeral speech case”). To date,
the police investigation is ongoing.
 
In addition, on April 2, 2015, at 4:00 pm, over twenty police cars
surrounded Mr. Rajab’s house and policemen arrested him. Mr. Rajab
was then sent to the General Directorate of Anti Corruption Economic and
Electronic Security to be interrogated and placed in detention in solitary
confinement in Isa Town Police Station. On April 3, 2015, Mr. Rajab was
interrogated by the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) regarding two new
charges brought against him under criminal case No.
2015/38288. The first charge was “insulting a statutory body” (Article
216 of the Bahraini Criminal Code) referring to the Ministry of Interior in
relation to tweets he posted denouncing the torture of detainees at Jaw Prison
(the “Jaw torture tweets” case). The second charge was “disseminating false
rumours in time of war” (Article 133 of the Bahraini Criminal Code) in relation
to tweets he published about the Saudi-Arabia led coalition air strikes in
Yemen (the “Yemen tweets” case). If sentenced on the second charge,
Mr. Rajab could be facing up to 10 years imprisonment. Mr. Rajab
refused to sign the police minutes of the investigations. On April 4, 2015,
Mr. Rajab was brought before the Public Prosecution. The Prosecution
ordered seven days detention pending investigation. On April 5, 2015, security
police confiscated all electronics devices belonging to Mr. Rajab and
members of his family.
 
On April 11, 2015, the prosecution ordered an additional fifteen days in
detention for Mr. Rajab. On April 26, 2015, the Public Prosecution
officially charged Mr. Rajab under Articles 133 and 216. The Public
Prosecution subsequently extended his detention for an additional fifteen days.
On May 11, the Bahraini High Court extended Nabeel Rajab´s preventive detention
for 15 days.
 
On May 14, 2015, the Bahrain Criminal Court of Appeal upheld the
six-month prison sentence (the
“terrorism tweet” case). 
 
On July 13, 2015, the King of Bahrain Hamad Ben Issa Al-Khalifa ordered
through Royal Pardon the release of Mr. Nabeel Rajab for health reasons. Mr.
Rajab had already served three of the six months jail sentence. 
 
Moreover, on the same date, the Public Prosecution imposed a travel ban
against Mr. Rajab in relation to criminal case No. 2015/38288 related to the
Jaw torture and Yemen tweets cases.
