The Observatory for the
Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the International
Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation Against Torture
(OMCT), requests your urgent intervention in the following
situation in Iran.
 
Description of the situation:
 
The Observatory has been
informed by the League for the Defence of Human Rights in Iran (LDDHI) about the
arbitrary detention and judicial harassment of Ms. Mahnaz Mohammadi, an
Iranian documentary film maker and women’s human rights defender. 
 
According to the
information received, on June 7, 2014, Ms. Mahnaz Mohammadi was summoned to
Evin prison and arrested to serve a five-year imprisonment sentence. Ms.
Mohammadi was tried by Branch 28 of the Islamic Revolution Court of Tehran in
October 2012 and sentenced on November 13, 2012 after being convicted for
“gathering and collusion against the national security”, and “spreading
propaganda against the State”, through cooperation with foreign media including
the BBC, and supporting the
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women
(CEDAW). Her sentence was upheld by Branch 54 of Appeals Court of Tehran
sometime in early 2014.
 
Ms. Mohammadi is a an award
winning documentary film maker and a women’s rights defender, who has been
active in the framework of the Campaign for Equality (aka One Million
Signatures Campaign), ever since it was established in 2006. This Campaign is a
movement of women rights activists who have been fighting against legalised
discrimination against women. 
 
The Observatory expresses its deep concern about
the decision of the authorities to uphold the five-year prison sentence against
Ms. Mahnaz Mohammadi, as it merely aims at
sanctioning her activities as a documentary film
maker and women’s human rights defender. 
Accordingly, the Observatory strongly
denounces her detention as arbitrary and as means to infringe freedom of
expression in Iran, in violation of international law. 
 
Background
information:
 
On March 4, 2007, Ms.
Mahnaz Mohammadi was detained for a few days, together with 32 other women’s
rights activists, who were protesting outside the building of the Islamic
Revolution Court in Tehran. 
 
On July 30, 2009, she was
detained, together with other film makers and artists, for 24 hours after
attending commemoration ceremonies at the graves of protestors, who had been
killed during the unrest following the 2009 presidential elections.
 
On June 26, 2011, Ms.
Mohammadi was again arrested by security forces at her home and was held in
incommunicado detention until July 27, 2011 in Ward 2A of Evin prison, which is
administered by the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps. 
 
Ms. Mohammadi suffers from
an incurable disease with symptoms similar to Multiple Sclerosis, for which she
must regularly take medicine to avoid strong muscular pains and local
paralysis. During the one month in detention in 2011, she was hospitalised for
a few days and was only granted bail because doctors considered her continued
detention too risky and refused to take responsibility for it.
 
Actions requested:
 
Please
write to the Iranian authorities and ask them to:
 
i. Guarantee
in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Ms. Mahnaz Mohammadi,
as well as of all human rights defenders in Iran; 
 
ii. Ensure that she received adequate medical care and her regular supply
of essential medicines; 
 
iii. Release Ms. Mahnaz Mohammadi immediately and unconditionally as
her detention is arbitrary since it only aims at
sanctioning her human rights activities;
 
iv. Put
an end to any kind of harassment - including at the judicial level - against Ms. Mahnaz Mohammadi and all human rights defenders in Iran, and release them all;
 
v. Conform
in any circumstances with the provisions of the Declaration on Human Rights
Defenders, adopted on December 9, 1998 by the United Nations General Assembly,
in particular its article 1, which states that “everyone has the right,
individually or in association with others, to promote the protection and
realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and
international levels”, and its article 12.2 which provides that “the State
shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent
authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against
any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination,
pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her
legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”;
 
vi. Ensure
in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in
accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments
ratified by Iran.
