New information The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by The Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy (TCHRD), member of the SOS-Torture network, about the sentencing of Tibetan artist named Kunkhen on 20 November 2007. According to the information received, Kunkhen was sentenced to nine years of imprisonment on charges of “carrying out splittist activities” by the Kardze Intermediate People’s Court on 20 November 2007. There are concerns that the trial was unfair. There is currently no information available on his physical condition and where he was taken after the court’s verdict was delivered. Moreover, the location and conditions of his detention prior to his sentencing remain unknown. As of issuing this urgent appeal, the fate of Mr. Lobsang Phuntsok remains unclear. The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned for the physical and psychological integrity of Kunkhen as well as for his sentencing which seems to merely aim at sanctioning his right to freedom of expression and thought. OMCT is also very much concerned about the fate of Mr. Lobsang Phuntsok. OMCT recalls that China is a State party to the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment which prohibits torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. OMCT urges the authorities to conform with China’s international human rights obligations, commitments that were reaffirmed on the occasion of its election as a member of the new United Nations Human Rights Council. Reminder of the Situation Mr. Lobsang Phuntsok, a 30 years old monk of Lithang Monastery, was arrested on 15 September 2007 following a sudden raid carried out in his monastery residence by Lithang County Public Bureau Security (PSB) officials. Mr. Lobsang Phuntsok was allegedly arrested because of his close link with artist Kunkhen who was also arrested on 22 August 2007 by the Lithang County PSB officials reportedly for having taken pictures of Mr. Ronggay A’drak when he staged the open protest during the Lithang Horse Race on 1 August 2007 (See OMCT Urgent appeal CHN 310807).
