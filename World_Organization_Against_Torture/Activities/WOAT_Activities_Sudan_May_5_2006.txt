Brief description of the situationThe International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Sudan Organisation Against Torture (SOAT), a member of the OMCT network, of the attack on 13 April 2006 by the armed militias on Karamagay village, North East Nyala, Sudan.   According to the information received, armed militias on horses and camels, numbering more than five hundred, attacked and looted Karamagay village, Southern Dafur State. Besides killing 15 people and wounding 11 others, the militias also looted over 517 cows, 850 sheep, 720 goats, 22 horses, 60 donkeys and 8 camels. According to the villagers, who belong largely to the Birgid tribe, the attackers originate from Niteaga, Shearia province, Southern Darfur state and are alleged to belong to the Janjaweed militias.  According to the information received, Shearia town emerges as the new front for confrontations between government forces and the rebel opposition groups in Darfur since November 2005. It is alleged that the government adopted a strategy to shift the war to Shearia in early September 2005, following the attack of the Sudan Liberation Army (SLA) on this town in which reportedly 18 civilians were killed and 1000 camels were looted. The government in response encouraged armed militias to amass in the area and implicitly allowed the Janjaweed militias to loot the local population property with impunity. In the first week of November 2005, the militias working with government forces attacked and looted the market of Shearia. Following the attack and looting, persons belonging to the Zaghawa tribe fled Shearia town to El Fahal, Otash and Dereig Internally displaced Camps, adding to the already large IDP population in Southern Darfur. The remaining population, largely from the Birgid tribe set up a camp near the African Union Camp in Shearia.    Reportedly, the Commander of the Armed Forces Commander in Shearia town is a Mr. Asim Torobora. Due to continuing fighting between government forces and the SLA and the continuing presence of armed militias, access for aid agencies to the area has been almost impossible. The population in the surrounding areas are in desperate need of food and water, shelter and medicine.   The details of the persons killed during the attack on 13 April 2006 are:1.
