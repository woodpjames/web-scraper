Bin Salman of Saudi Arabia makes his first visits to Western capitals since
being appointed as the Kingdom’s heir apparent, we the undersigned human rights
organisations would like to draw the attention of his hosts and of the
international community to the continued imprisonment of many prominent human
rights defenders and other prisoners of conscience in Saudi Arabia as a result
of their peaceful activism.
Abdulaziz
Al-Shubaili, Essa Al-Hamid, Abdulrahman Al-Hamid, Fowzan Al-Harbi, Saleh
Al-Ashwan, Sheikh Suliaman Al-Rashudi, Abdullah Al-Hamid, Mohammed Al-Qahtani,
Abdulkareem Yousef Al-Khoder, Mohammed Saleh Al-Bajadi and Omar Al-Said, all members of the Saudi
Civil and Political Rights Association (ACPRA), faced unfair trials, and were
sentenced to a total of nearly 200 years in prison sentences and travel bans
for their peaceful activism. The independent non-governmental organization
ACPRA was established on 12 October 2009 to promote civil and political rights
in the country and to call for peaceful democratic reforms including a
constitutional monarchy, an elected parliament, an independent judiciary and
fair trials. ACPRA also reported on human rights violations, helped victims and
their relatives file legal claims against the responsible authorities and communicated
cases of human rights violations to UN human rights bodies. However, the
organisation was banned by the Saudi authorities five years ago today, on 9
March 2013.
In London and
Washington Mohamed Bin Salman is promoting his ambitious plans for economic and
social change in the Kingdom as a bold agenda for reform. We believe that
genuine reform must start with respect and safeguards for basic human rights
and freedoms. While the Crown Prince has promised that women in Saudi Arabia
will soon be allowed to drive for the first time in three decades, prisoners of
conscience who dared to advocate for women’s right to drive, such as Alaa Brinji and Essam Koshak, remain in jail serving lengthy sentences. Another
prominent campaigner for women’s rights is human rights lawyer Waleed Abu al-Khair, the founder of
Monitor of Human Rights in Saudi Arabia, who was tried under counter-terrorism
legislation and sentenced in July 2014 to 15 years in prison. Saudi campaigners
for women’s rights regard the right to drive as only a first, small step toward
equality and freedom for women, and are calling for a far more significant measure:
ending the guardianship system that allows Saudi men to control many aspects of
their daughters’, wives’, sisters’ and mothers’ lives.
However, all those
within the Kingdom who challenge Saudi Arabia’s human rights record, or
peacefully demand basic freedoms, face arbitrary detention, unfair trials and
lengthy prison sentences.
We the undersigned call
once again on the Saudi authorities to release immediately and unconditionally
all the members of ACPRA who are still in prison, as well as all other
prisoners of conscience, and ensure a safe and conducive environment for human
rights defenders. We appeal to the Western leaders and officials meeting Crown
Prince Mohamed Bin Salman and his delegation to urge them to release those who
have been detained for peacefully exercising their right to freedoms of expression,
association and assembly, drop all outstanding charges related to their human
rights activities, and guarantee human rights and freedoms in Saudi Arabia as
the basis for all other reforms.
