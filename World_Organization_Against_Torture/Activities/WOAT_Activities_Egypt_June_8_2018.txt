Judicial harassment

The Observatory for the Protection of
Human Rights Defenders, a partnership of the World Organisation Against Torture
(OMCT) and FIDH, has received new information and requests your urgent
intervention in the following situation in Egypt.
 
New information:
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable
sources about the ongoing arbitrary detention of Ms. Amal Fathy, a woman human rights
defender known for being vocal against human rights violations, in particular
arbitrary detentions of activists in Egypt. Ms. Fathy is married to Mr. Mohamed
Lotfy, Executive Director of the Egyptian Commission for Rights
and Freedoms (ECRF), and a former member of the now banned “April 6 Youth
Movement”.
 
According to the
information received, on June 7, 2018, the Maadi Prosecutor extended for the
third time Ms. Amal Fathy’s preventive detention for a further 2-week period, without providing any
reason. She is
accused of “broadcasting a video harming national
security”, “posting a
video inciting to overthrow the regime and spreading false rumors”, and “misusing social
media” within the Case No. 7991 of 2018.
 
The Observatory strongly condemns the ongoing
arbitrary detention of Ms. Amal Fathy, which seems to merely aim at punishing her
for her peaceful and legitimate human rights activities and those of her
husband, Mr. Mohamed Lotfy. Indeed, this is not the first time that ECRF and
its members are subjected to harassment, due to their documentation of cases of
torture in prisons, enforced disappearances as well as their legal
support in Giulio Regeni’s
case. The raid on Mr. Mohamed Lotfy’s house and
the arrest of his wife Amal Fathy actually took place one week before the visit of the Italian technical
team to review video footage in connection with the 2016 torture and killing of
the Italian researcher.
 
The Observatory urges the
Egyptian authorities to release Ms. Amal Fathy immediately and unconditionally, to drop all charges against her
and to put an end to all forms of harassment against her, including at the
judicial level.
 
Background information:
 
On May 9, 2018,
Ms. Amal Fathy posted a 12-minute video on Facebook criticising the
Egyptian Government for failing to protect women against sexual harassment as
well as over a general deterioration in living conditions in the country.
 
The next day,
pro-government and State-owned media outlets released articles citing the
video, identifying Ms. Fathy as an “April 6 Youth movement” activist and the
wife of Mohamed Lotfy and accusing her of insulting Egypt and Egyptian
institutions. This was followed by a wave of harassment and threats on social
media against Ms. Fathy.
 
On May 11, 2018, at around
2.30 am, Egyptian security forces broke into the house in Cairo of Ms. Amal
Fathy and Mr. Mohamed Lotfy and started searching the house. Their mobile
phones were seized and they were denied the right to communicate with a lawyer
or their relatives. The two activists were brought to Maadi police station, in
the south of Cairo, along with their three-year-old son.
 
Around three hours later,
Mr. Lotfy and his son were released. The Maadi Prosecutor subsequently placed
Ms. Amal Fathy under preventive detention for 15 days within the Criminal case
No. 7991 of 2018.
 
On May 12, 2018, Ms. Amal Fathy was transferred to Qanater women’s prison. 
 
On May 13, 2018, Ms. Amal Fathy was questioned by
the High State
Security Prosecution
about the “April 6 Youth Movement”, ECRF and the activities of her
husband. She was then ordered to be placed under preventive detention for an
additional 15 days in the
framework of another case, Criminal case No. 621 of 2018, under which she is
facing new charges of “membership of
an illegal organisation”, “using the
Internet to disseminate ideas that seek to call for terrorist acts” and
“broadcasting false news to disrupt public security and harm national interest”
in relation to the posting of the same video. 
 
On May 24, the Maadi
Prosecutor extended Ms. Amal Fathy’s preventive detention for 15 additional
days within Case No. 7991 of 2018, without providing reason. Ms. Fathy appealed
the decision. On May 30,
2018, Ms. Fathy’s appeal was rejected. 
 
Actions requested:

asking them to:
 
i. Guarantee in all circumstances the physical
and psychological integrity of Ms. Amal Fathy, Mr. Mohamed Lotfy, their

ii. Immediately and unconditionally

Fathy as her detention is arbitrary as it is merely aimed at punishing her
for her human rights activities as well as those of her husband;
 
iii. Put an end to all acts of harassment,
including at the judicial level, against Ms. Amal Fathy as well as against
Mr. Mohamed Lotfy and all human rights defenders in Egypt, and ensure that they are able to
carry out their activities without hindrance; 
 
iv. Conform with the provisions of the UN
Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United
