The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint
partnership of FIDH and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), requests
your urgent intervention in the following situation in Vietnam.
 
Description of the situation:
 
The Observatory has been informed by
reliable sources about the arbitrary detention and imminent deportation of Ms. Debbie
Stothard, Secretary-General of FIDH and Coordinator of the Alternative
ASEAN Network on Burma (ALTSEAN-Burma). 
 
According to the
information received, on September 9, 2018, at approximately 3:00pm, Vietnamese
immigration authorities at Hanoi’s Noi Bai International Airport barred Ms.
Stothard from entering the country upon her arrival and detained her. Authorities
justified the restrictions by invoking Article 21(9) of the 2014 Law On
Foreigners’ Entry Into, Exit From, Transit Through and Residence in Vietnam.
Article 21(9) bars individuals from entering Vietnam “for national defense,
security or social order and safety.”  

Ms. Stothard was traveling to Vietnam in order to attend the World Economic
Forum on ASEAN (WEF), which is scheduled to take place in Hanoi from September
11 to 13, 2018. Ms. Stothard had been invited to speak at a panel discussion on
“Innovation Under Stress”, scheduled for September 13, 2018.
 
Ms. Stothard was
subsequently informed that she would remain detained at Hanoi’s Noi Bai International
Airport overnight and be deported to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on the morning of
September 10, 2018. Ms. Stothard was not given access to a lawyer.
 
On September 6, 2018, WEF
staff members were informed by Vietnam’s Deputy Prime Minister’s Office that
Ms. Stothard had been blacklisted because of her human rights work.
 
The
Observatory strongly condemns Ms. Stothard’s detention and imminent
deportation, which seems aimed at punishing her for her legitimate human rights
activities in the region.
 
The
Observatory also recalls that the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary
Detention (WGAD) has considered “arbitrary” the deprivation of liberty of human
rights defenders who seek to enter a third country to peacefully exercise their
rights to freedom of expression, freedom of assembly, and freedom of
association.[1]
 
Actions requested:
 
Please write to the authorities of Vietnam
asking them to:
 
i. Immediately and unconditionally release Ms. Debbie Stothard and guarantee, in all circumstances, her
freedom of movement and that of all human rights defenders in Vietnam;
 
ii. Put an end to any harassment against all human rights defenders in
Vietnam, and ensure in all circumstances that they are able to carry out their
legitimate activities without any hindrance or fear of reprisals;
iii. Conform to the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights
Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9,
1998, in particular with Articles 1, 5(b), and 12.2;
iv. Ensure in all circumstances respect for
human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human
rights standards and international instruments ratified by Vietnam.
