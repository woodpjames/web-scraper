Ms. Svensson-McCarthy and Mr. Sottas presented to the members of COHOM the Study and discussed the Study’s recommendations for effective action against torture through the implementation by EU Institutions and Member States of the EU Guidelines.  The Study had been requested by the European Parliament and had for overall aim the enhancement of the implementation of the EU guidelines and their contribution towards the prevention and eradication of all forms of torture and ill-treatment. The 150 page report was based on field missions to four countries and desk studies of three other countries and on the input from civil society organisations, EU officials and representatives of EU Member States. Following their presentation of the Study to the EU Parliament Subcommittee on Human Rights in June 2007, the COHOM invited Ms. Svensson-McCarthy and Mr. Sottas to meet with them and discuss the relevant issues. Based on the Study’s recommendations, a twelve point proposal for EU action to improve the effectiveness of the implementation of the guidelines was submitted to COHOM.
