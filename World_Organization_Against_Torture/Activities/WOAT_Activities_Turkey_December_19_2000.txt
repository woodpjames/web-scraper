Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned by the current situation in Turkish prisons.  According to the information received, in the early hours of Tuesday morning, 19th December 2000, the army and police attempted to enter prisons across the country, in particular the prisons of Bayrampasa and Umraniye in Istanbul, under operations of “rescue” with the aim of halting the hunger strikes, of approximately 1000 political prisoners protesting against Type-F cellular prisons.  It is further reported that 203 of the hunger strikers are on a “death fast” for the last 61 days.  OMCT has been informed that in the case of Bayrampasa prison, smoke, possibly indicating a fire, can be seen from outside of the prison.  Sporadic gunshots have also reportedly been heard.  Furthermore, helicopters are being used to transport police directly inside the prison.  In Umraniye, it is reported that bulldozers are being used to destroy walls and enter the prison.  Within both prisons, reports have indicated violence between prisoners and government forces, involving the use of Kalashnikovs.  Similar operations have been undertaken in Ulucanlar prison in Ankara, Ceyhan (south), Bursa (north-east), Aydin (west), Buca (west), Usak (west), Canakkale (north-west), Kirsehir (central Turkey), Nigde (south) and Cankiri in the north-east of Ankara.  Of those prisoners carrying out the “death fast”, 50 were forcibly transported to hospital where many have refused treatment and another 200 prisoners, who had participated in the hunger strike but not in the death fast, have also been forcibly transported to hospital. In some case, these prisoners have been reportedly segregated from all other patients in the hospital.  According to the sources, three people had died as a result of setting themselves on fire.  Reports also indicate that others may have died in the prisons in this manner.  Action requested  Please write to the authorities in Turkey urging them to:  i.	guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of all prisoners in Turkey; ii.	order an immediate investigation into these incidents; iii.	guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
