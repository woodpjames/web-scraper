Brief description of the situation  The Observatory reiterates its concern at the insecurity and repression  suffered by defenders of human rights in Colombia and in particular its concern for the life and safety of  Mrs. Rocío Campos y Astrid E. Manrique Carvajal, members of the Consejo Directivo de la Asociación de Familiares de Detenidos-Desaparecidos (Council of the association of families of detained and disappeared, ASFADDES) of  Colombia and the same organisation's section in Barrancabermeja and Cauca respectively and of Mr. Gilberto Agudelo Martínez, President of the University Workers and Employees Union of Colombia (SINTRAUNICOL.).  ASFADDES reports on the persistent threats and harassment of Mrs Rocio Campos  who received various telephone calls from unknown persons between 22nd and 25th May uttering threats, letting off fire arms and asking  about her brother Daniel Campos, victim of  forced disappearance since May 1998. During 1999 she had already been the victim of similar acts and was followed by unknown persons. The reports add that Mrs Rocio Campos  came to know that her name appeared in a list of threatened persons.   They also claim that they have requested repeatedly that the Barrancabermeja section be given a system of communication with other organisations in view of the insecure situation in the region.   ASFADDES has reported that similar actions have been directed against Mrs Astrid E. Manrique Carvajal, who too has been subjected to constant harassment and threats. Moreover, as part of the picture her daughter Juliet Tatiana Manrique was followed by a man who stated that he was a member of the police and claimed to know her mother, her place of work and other personal and professional details and threatened to kill them if she told this story to her mother. Also on May 30th during the commemoration of the   ASFADDES has also reported the forced disappearance since April 7th 2000 of  Sr. Gilberto Agudelo Martínez, aged 48,who has been working since 1986 at the National University of Colombia, Headquarters Medellin, where he also held the post of President of the Union of Workers and Employees of the National University of Colombia, SINTRAUNICOL. According to ASFADDES his disappearance occurred since 7th April, presumably when he was travelling from Bogota to Bucaramanga and that on June 7th 2000 Radio Caracol reported that Sr. Agudelo Martinez had been kidnapped by the Autodefensas.  The  SINTRAUNICOL, on its part, reported that  Sr. Gilberto Agudelo Martínez had been the victim of repeated threats, both direct and indirect, on the part of the AUC (Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia) and that the situation was intensified since February 2000.  The Observatory is gravely concerned by the repetition of acts such as those reported above, which are part of a climate of violence and impunity,  and have grave repercussions for Colombian society, and especially human rights defenders.   Action requested  Kindly write to the Colombian authorities urging them to:  i.	guarantee the safety and physical and psychological integrity of Mrs   Rocío Campos Pérez y Astrid E. Manrique Carvajal and take without delay all appropriate measures to determine the whereabouts of Sr.  Gilberto Agudelo Martínez and guarantee in all circumstances his safety and physical and psychological integrity;  ii.	carry out a thorough and impartial investigation into the facts mentioned above and apply to whoever is found guilty the penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions provided by law;  iii.	ensure the application of the provisions of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 9th 1998, in particular with reference to the protection of the right of everyone "individually and in association with others to promote and to strive for the  protection and the realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels."
