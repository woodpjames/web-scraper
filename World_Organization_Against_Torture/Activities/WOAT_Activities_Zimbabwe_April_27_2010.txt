The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), has received new information and requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in Zimbabwe.
New information:
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the arbitrary arrest and subsequent release of Messrs. Joel Hita, Regional Chairperson of the Zimbabwe Human Rights Association (ZIMRIGHTS) in Masvingo, Lio Chamahwinya, Ms. Olivia Gumbo, ZIMRIGHTS National Programme Manager, and Ms. Cynthia Manjoro, member of ZIMRIGHTS.
According to the information received, during the evening of April 26, 2010, a group of police officers arrested Messrs. Joel Hita, Lio Chamahwinya, Ms. Olivia Gumbo and Ms. Cynthia Manjoro while they were preparing the photo exhibition entitled “Reflections” for the pictorial launch at the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) hall in the city of Masvingo. The “Reflections” exhibition is part of a national healing programme that aims at inciting reflections on the political violence that occurred in 2007.
The police officers stated the exhibition should immediately stop, impounded the pictures and took Messrs. Joel Hita, Lio Chamahwinya, Ms. Olivia Gumbo and Ms. Cynthia Manjoro to the Masvingo Police Station. Mr. Chamahwinya, Ms. Gumbo and Ms. Manjoro remained detained for two hours before being released. As for Mr. Hita, he was released on April 27 around 5 pm, and will appear in court on April 28, 2010, at 9 am, under the charge of “holding a public meeting without notifying the authorities”, although the exhibition launch was a private function.
The Observatory recalls that on March 23, 2010, the Executive Director of ZIMRIGHTS, Mr. Okay Machisa, was arrested at the Gallery Delta of Harare while he was checking on the preparation of the same photo exhibition, and subsequently released (See background information).
The Observatory condemns the arbitrary arrest of Messrs. Joel Hita, Lio Chamahwinya, Ms. Olivia Gumbo and Ms. Cynthia Manjoro, and urges the Zimbabwe authorities to immediately dismiss the charges held against Mr. Joel Hita, as well as to put an end to the continuing harassment - including at the judicial level - against members of ZIMRIGHTS, which seem to merely aim at sanction their human rights activities.
Background information:
On November 2009, several armed men waited at Mr. Okay Machisa home’s gate as he returned from a meeting. They left after Mr. Machisa alerted the police and colleagues.
On February 16, 2010, Mr. Machisa received by email an anonymous message from a person identifying himself as Dzapasi Mumunda warning him to be careful with his work. The message said “Be careful my friend a number of people at my workplace have been assigned to bring you down. I refused to be involved. Be careful especially at your home”. 
On February 25, 2010, Messrs. Nunurai Jena, Netsai Kaitano and Jabilusa Tshuma received different anonymous messages on their cell phones ordering them to put an end to their work on the constitution making process and threatening them with death. The messages also asked them about their motives to work within the association. All the messages were sent from the same number which is now unreachable. Mr. Okay Machisa also received a threatening message telling him to stay out of the country. The message said: “You enjoy flying in and out of the country demonizing your country, why don’t you go and stay there? They monitor, soon you will all stay out”. On March 2, 2010, ZIMRIGHTS filed a police report under number IR 030 117.
On March 17 and 19, 2010, the police interrogated Mr. Okay Machisa and Ms. Olivia Gumbo about the objective and intents of the “Reflections” exhibition, scheduled to open on March 24, 2009. On March 23, 2010, at 11 am, the police took photos of the exhibition. Previously, ZIMRIGHTS had sent a notification letter for the exhibition to the police and had previously acquired an authorisation from the Harare High Court.
On March 23, 2010, at 4 pm, Mr. Okay Machisa was arrested at the Gallery Delta of Harare, while he was checking on the preparation of the exhibition. At around 3.45 pm, two truckloads of uniformed and plain clothes police had descended on the premises of the Gallery Delta in Central Harare and proceeded, without a warrant or justifiable cause, to remove the 65 photographs which formed the exhibition. During the raid, the 20 police officers acted in a threatening and intimidating manner towards Mr. Machisa, who was held in Harare Central Police Station, before being released at 6.30 pm, following the intervention of lawyers from Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights (ZLHR). The Officer Commanding Harare Central District advised that he had “not approved” the launch and gave Mr. Machisa seven days to provide “letters of consent from individuals and organisations” appearing in the photographs, failing which he threatened to launch unspecified criminal charges against Mr. Machisa.
On March 24, 2010, at 3 pm, following an urgent chamber application filed by ZLHR lawyers, the High Court ordered the police to return the photo exhibits to ZIMRIGHTS within an hour, with which the police complied.
