This is one of the main activities of OMCT and is complementary to giving direct assistance to victims. These alternative reports are a valuable source of information for the independent experts who monitor the implementation of the United Nations human rights instruments. With these reports, it is possible to evaluate the situation as objectively as possible and to take a critical look at government action aimed at implementing human rights standards. Recent alternative reports and other relevant information submitted or to be submitted by OMCT to the United Nations treaty bodies include:    Human Rights Committee - HRC   88th session October 2006:  Honduras – Human  Rights Violations in Honduras (in Spanish)    Rwanda -  Human  Rights Situation in Rwanda (briefing note for the list of issues - in French)   89th session March 2007:  Madagascar – report in preparation      Committee Against Torture  - CAT  37th session November 2006:   Tajikistan –  Human Rights Violations in Tajikistan Burundi – Human Rights Violations in Burundi  (in French) Mexico – State Violence  against detained Women in Mexico: The San Salvador Atenco case   38th session May 2007:    Japan –  Report in preparation         Committee  on the Elimination of    Discrimination against Women - CEDAW  36th session August  2006:   Georgia - Violence against Women  Mexico - State Violence  against detained Women in Mexico    Democratic Republic of the    Congo (DRC) - Violence  against Women in the DRC      Committee on the Rights of the Child  - CRC  43rd session September 2006:  Benin - Children's  Rights in Benin (in French)    44th session January 2007:   Kenya -  Rights of the Child  in Kenya  Chile - Children's rights in Chile (in Spanish)        Follow up missions on the implementation of UN Treaty Bodies' Concluding Observations  Press releases    Georgia: Follow up mission and launching of the shadow report in Tbilisi in September 2006 Guatemala: Follow up mission and launching of the shadow report in  Guatemala City in November 2006  Article in  "Prensa Libre" “Si el  torturado fuera hijo del ministro sería otra cosa”    Honduras: Follow up mission and launching of the shadow report in Tegucigalpa in November 2006 (in Spanish)      Article in  "Revistazo" : "Estado   emplazado por Naciones Unidas para dar cuentas sobre Derechos Humanos"        Georgia (CEDAW): Concern for the implementation of measures to combat violence against   women Democratic Republic of Congo - DRC (CEDAW): UN Committee's   concern for violence against women and their status in the DRC      The World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) is  the world’s largest coalition of non-governmental organisations fighting against  arbitrary detention, torture, summary and extrajudicial executions, forced  disappearances and other forms of violence.
