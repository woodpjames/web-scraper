New information: The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources of ongoing harassment and death threats against Mr. Jitman Basnet, a lawyer, journalist and Secretary General of the Lawyer’s Forum for Human Rights (LAFHUR), in Babarmahal, Kathmandu. According to information received, on August 7, 2007, an unknown female resumed threatening phone calls to Mr. Basnet, after an hiatus of approximately two months (See background information). On August 11, 2007, Mr. Basnet was called again by a different individual who, in response to Mr. Basnet’s request that she identify herself, told him: “you are going to be killed, we will also kill your wife”. Following these threatening phone calls, Mr. Basnet filed a complaint at Tinkune police station on August 13, 2007. On August 18, 2007, a caller identifying himself as Khadga Mahato, and then subsequently as Mahat, contacted Mr. Basnet. While no threat was made on this occasion, the caller said that he was named in “Mr. Basnet’s book” (See background information). The Observatory deplores the ongoing intimidation of Mr. Basnet, which appears to be entirely motivated by his human rights activities. The Observatory wishes to point out that even though the situation of human rights defenders in Nepal has improved recently, this case of intimidation may announce further attacks on human rights defenders in the country. Background information: On February 4, 2004, Mr. Basnet was arrested by members of the Bhairabnath Army Battalion, Kathmandu, and then arbitrarily detained incommunicado for 258 days and tortured[1]. After his release, Mr. Basnet was repeatedly harassed by members of the army and, as a result, finally left Kathmandu. He spent some 17 months in India before returning to Nepal. On August 27, 2006, Mr. Basnet filed a writ of mandamus before the Supreme Court, demanding that a High Level Committee be formed to investigate into human rights violations that took place during the recent conflicts in Nepal, as well as into the cases of disappearances that the UN Office of High Commissioner for Human Rights-Nepal (OHCHR-Nepal) submitted to the government in May 2005. He also accused King Gyanendra and army officials for supplying false information to the Supreme Court. King Gyanendra is cited in these cases as he was the Chief of the Royal Nepal Army and therefore bears command responsibility. His request is due to be heard on October 5, 2007. In March 2007, Mr. Basnet published a book entitled 258 Dark Days relating to his prolonged custody in Bhairabnath Battalion’s facilities. The book also covers the stories of many other detainees who were tortured, raped, killed and/or disappeared at the hands of the Bhairabnath Barracks’ personnel, giving an insight into Nepal’s turbulent and bloody recent past, concerning which impunity still prevails. On May 21, 2007, Mr. Basnet had already received an anonymous call from a public telephone booth in Swayambhu, Kathmandu, in which he was threatened to “bear the results” of his engagement in the struggle against impunity in Nepal. Actions required Please write to the Nepalese authorities urging them to:  Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Jitman Basnet; Conduct a fair, impartial and independent inquiry into the above-mentioned events in order to bring the authors to justice and apply them a sentence which is proportional to the gravity of their crimes; Put an end to all acts of harassment and threats against Mr. Jitman Basnet as well as against all human rights defenders in the country; Conform with the provisions of the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its Article 1 that states, “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels” and article 12(2) that states, “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”; Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by Nepal.
