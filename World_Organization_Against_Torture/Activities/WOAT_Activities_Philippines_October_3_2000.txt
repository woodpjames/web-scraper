Brief description of the situation :  The Observatory has been informed by KARAPATAN (Alliance for the Advancement of People’s Rights) and DINTEG (Cordillera Indigenous Peoples Law Center) that the DINTEG and CHRO (Cordillera Human Rights Organization) office was raided for the second time this year on the morning of September 25th 2000. The door to the CHRO room was discovered open at 8:30 a.m with files strewn all over the place. Missing were petty cash worth approx: P1,500.00 (approx. $33) and some diskettes.    The office had previously been broken into by unidentified men on February 7th 2000.  In this incident, all files were carted away.    The Observatory believes that this latest incident and that of February 7th 2000 are a direct attack on the work of DINTEG and CHRO in an attempt to prevent them from carrying out their work for the protection of human rights.  Action requested:  Please write to the authorities in the Philippines demanding that they:  i.	ensure that a full and impartial investigation is carried out into this incident and that DINTEG and CHRO are able to carry out their work as human rights defenders;  ii.	ensure the implementation of the provisions of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 9 1998 (Declaration concerning the rights and responsibilities of individuals, groups and institutions to promote and protect universally recognised human rights and fundamental liberties ) in particular its Article 1 which states that «Everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels» and Article 12.2 which provides that «The State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration.»  iii.	guarantee the effective respect of fundamental rights and liberties in accordance with the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the international and regional Pacts and Covenants ratified by the Philippines.
