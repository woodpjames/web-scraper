Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Kyrgyz Committee for Human Rights, a member of the OMCT network, and the Memorial Human Rights Centre of continuing attacks against Turkmen dissidents in Moscow.  According to the information received, on September 2nd 2003, a part time staff member of the Turkmen Services of Radio "Liberty," Shanazar Berdyev, was attacked in Moscow. According to the victim's father, S. Berdyev was struck on the head while entering his apartment at around 22:00. His attacker was reportedly wearing a police uniform, and afterwards slapped him and said "I don't wish to see you more," before leaving. The next day, S. Berdyev was reportedly not feeling well and sought medical assistance as a result of the injury to his head.   22-year-old S. Berdyev is the son of Turkmen dissident Muhamedgeldi Berdyev, who also works in Moscow with the Turkmen Services of Radio "Liberty." M. Berdyev began openly criticizing the Turkmen authorities on Radio "Liberty" in November 1997 after his brother Meretmuhammet Berdyev, who owned opposition magazine “Turkmen ili” in the Maryi district of Turkmenistan, was forcibly placed in mental hospital and died as a result of the treatment he received there, which, it is thought, included torture. Following this, S. Berdyev left Turkmenistan for Moscow, out of fear of being persecuted by the authorities.   According to the information received, the September 2nd, 2003 incident is not the first attack against the Berdyev family. At around 22:45 on October 23rd, 2002, in Moscow near the station “Kuzminka”, S. Berdyev was reportedly approached by two persons, who called him by his name and were speaking the Turkmen language, and tried to force him into a car – he was able to escape this attempted kidnapping. Separately, on July 29th, 2003, M. Berdyev was reportedly beaten by two attackers on the streets of Moscow.   This was after publication, on July 24th, of an anonymous article on the site "Asia Center," which contained a brief description of Turkmen opposition and the journalists, and named S. Berdyev's name, saying that he "works for Avdy Kuliev by translating gossip articles into English" and that S. Berdyev's involvement in opposition activity could hurt his life. OMCT considers that this amounts to a death threat and is therefore gravely concerned for S. Berdyev's personal integrity. M. Berdyev reports that they have not reported these incidents to the police department out of fear of reprisals.  The International Secreteriat of OMCT is gravely concerned for the physical and psychological integrity of both Shanazar and Muhamedgeldy Berdyev, particularly due to the death threats and attacks to which they have been subjected. OMCT calls upon the Russian authorities to guarantee their physical and psychological integrity at all times, and to launch an investigation into these attacks in order to identify the perpetrators of these acts and to bring them to justice.   Brief reminder of the situation  The attacks against members of the Berdyev family occur against a background in which other exiled opponents of the Turkmen regime have been subjected to attacks. Mr. Avdy Kuliev, a former Foreign Minister of Turkmenistan who, while in exile in Moscow, founded the United Democratic Opposition of Turkmenistan, was brutally beaten near his home on the outskirts of Moscow on the afternoon of August 6th, 2003 by a young man. Three months prior to this attack, Kuliev was publicly threatened by President Niazov who said "Everybody is sick of Kuliev, it is time to send him to another world."
