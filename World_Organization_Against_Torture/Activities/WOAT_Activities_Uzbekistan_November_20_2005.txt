Brief description of the situationThe International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Kyrgyz Committee for Human Rights (KCHR), a member of the network, of the disappearance of Mr. Marsel Isaev, following his arrival at Tashkent airport after being deported from Russia.  According to the information received, Mr. Marsel Isaev, 19 years old, a student from Uzbekistan, was deported from Kazan after refusing to testify that he was a member of a forbidden party “Hizb-ut-tahrir”. As a result, his passport was withdrawn from him and he was deported.  On the morning of 12th October, on the day that Marsel Isaev was to be deported from Russia, the Human Rights Representative of the Russian Federation, Mr. Vladimir Lukin, filed a request with the Commissioner for human rights in Uzbekistan, Saier Rashidova, that Mr. Isaev be allowed to enter Uzbekistan freely. However, friends of Mr. Isaev who went to meet him off his flight could not find him at the airport on the day he was supposed to arrive from Kazan, even though the security service at Tashkent airport confirmed that Mr. Isaev had passed through customs.  OMCT fears that Mr. Isaev was arrested by Uzbek special servicers upon his arrival in Tashkent. According to the information received, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, A. N. Kirichenko, had previously threatened to falsely inform the Uzbek special services of Mr. Isaev’s membership to the organisation “Hizb-ut-tahrir”.  According to the information received, Mr. Isaev had previously applied and been granted refugee status prior to his disappearance by the Office of migration of the Republic of Tatarstan.   The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned for the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Marsel Isaev.  Action requestedPlease write to the authorities in Uzbekistan urging them to: i.	Locate the whereabouts of Mr. Marsel Isaev and take all necessary measures to guarantee his physical and psychological integrity; ii.	Order a thorough and impartial investigation into the circumstances of his alleged disappearance, in order to identify those responsible, bring them to trial and apply the penal and/or administrative sanctions as provided by law; iii.	Guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with international human rights standards.
