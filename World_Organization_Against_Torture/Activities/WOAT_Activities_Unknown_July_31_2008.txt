Brief description of the situation: The Observatory has been informed by the Iranian League for the Defence of Human Rights (LDDHI) of the incommunicado detention of Mr. Saman Rasoulpour, a member of the Human Rights Organisation in Kurdistan (HROK). According to the information received, on July 27, 2008, Mr. Saman Rasoulpour was arrested while at home, in the city of Mahabad, Iranian Kurdistan, by agents from the intelligence services. As of issuing this urgent appeal, no information could be obtained as regards his place of detention and the possible charges pending against him. Mr. Rasoulpour was arrested after organising a peaceful gathering on July 26 to denounce the sentence to death issued against Mr. Farzad Kamangar for “collaboration with the Kurdistan Workers Party” (PKK)[1]. The Observatory expresses its deep concern about Mr. Saman Rasoulpour’s incommunicado detention, which is evidence of the ongoing harsh repression of the Iranian authorities against human rights defenders, in particular those working on minority issues and in minority areas. The Observatory further wishes to insist on the fact that Iran had committed to “uphold the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights” by presenting its candidacy to the Human Rights Council 2006 election and had insisted in this regard on the fact that the country had “continuously put great efforts into safeguarding the status and inherent dignity of the human person as well as the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms”. In order to ensure the continuation of these efforts, the Observatory urges the Islamic Republic of Iran to conform with international human rights standards. Actions requested: Please write to the authorities in Iran urging them to:   Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Saman Rasoulpour;  Take prompt action in order to locate Mr. Saman Rasoulpour, make his whereabouts public, and ensure his immediate and unconditional release since his detention is arbitrary as it only aims at sanctioning his human rights activities;  Put an end to all acts of harassment, including at the judicial level, against Iranian human rights defenders;  Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, Article 6.b, which provides that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others [...] freely to publish, impart or disseminate to others views, information and knowledge on all human rights and fundamental freedoms”, and Article 12.2, which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”;  More generally, ensure in all circumstances the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with international and regional human rights instruments ratified by Iran.
