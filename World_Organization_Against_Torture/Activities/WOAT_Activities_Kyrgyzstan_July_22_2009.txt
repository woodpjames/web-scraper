Brief description of the situation The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Kyrgyz Committee for Human Rights (KCHR), a member of OMCT SOS-Torture Network, about the death following severe beatings of Mr. Almaz Tashiev, an independent journalist, by police, on 4 July 2009, in Osh region. According to the information received, Mr. Almaz Tashiev was severely beaten by about eight policemen from Nookat area in Zhany-Bazar village, when he was at the police station in order to obtain a new passport. He was hospitalised in Osh regional hospital and did undergo a surgery on 10 July 2009, but died, on 12 July 2009, due to his injuries. According to the authorities, one policeman, who was allegedly off duty on the day of the event, confessed his participation in the beatings and was charged with “abuse of power”. According to the same authorities, Mr. Almaz Tashiev was beaten following a private dispute with the above mentioned policeman, version which is contested by Mr. Almaz Tashiev’s family, whom Mr. Almaz Tashiev had reported the events before his surgery, and witnesses to the event. The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned about the death following beatings of Mr. Almaz Tashiev and fears that the perpetrators may enjoy impunity. OMCT is all the more concerned about this event since Mr. Almaz Tashiev is not the first independent journalist and government critic who has faced physical abuse since the beginning of 2009. OMCT recalls that “(…) no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his life” (Article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights) and urges the competent Kyrgyz authorities to carry out a prompt, effective, thorough, independent and impartial investigation into the death of Mr. Almaz Tashiev, the results of which must be made public, in order to bring those responsible before a competent, independent and impartial tribunal and apply penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions as provided by law. Action requested Please write to the authorities in Kyrgyzstan urging them to:   Call upon the competent authorities to carry out a prompt, effective, thorough, independent and impartial investigation into the death of Mr. Almaz Tashiev, the result of which must be made public, in order to bring those responsible before a competent, independent and impartial tribunal and apply penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions as provided by law;  Ensure that adequate, effective and prompt reparation, including adequate compensation, is granted to the victim’s family;  Guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with international human rights standards.
