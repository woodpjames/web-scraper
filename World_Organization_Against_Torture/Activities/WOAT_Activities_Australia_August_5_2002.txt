Bhagwati in relation to human rights and immigration detention in Australia     Monday 5 August  2002    The World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) welcomes the conclusions and recommendations made in the report on human rights and immigration detention in Australia by Justice P.N. Bhagwati, Regional Advisor for Asia and the Pacific of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. The report was released following Justice Bhagwati’s visit to two detention centres in Australia from 24 May to 2 June 2002 and it focuses on the human rights issues related to the conditions of detention and the treatment of persons in the immigration detention facilities rather than on the legality of the detention itself.  OMCT is particularly alarmed by Justice Bhagwati’s assessment of the conditions of detention for persons being held in the Woomera Immigration Reception and Processing Centre where he found that the human rights situation could “in many ways, be considered inhuman and degrading.”  More generally, the report raises concerns relating to: the lengthy periods spent in immigration detention by some individuals; the situation of children in detention, including unaccompanied minors; the absence of proper judicial review of the detention itself; the impact of detention on family unity and family life; the fact that detainees do not receive concise and regular information about their rights and the absence of an institutionalised, independent monitoring and accountability mechanism.  In relation to concerns regarding the absence of an independent, permanent and institutionalised body to conduct ongoing monitoring and reporting activities in detention centres, OMCT would like to express its regret at the recent decision by the Australian government to vote against the UN Economic and Social Council’s adoption of an Optional Protocol to the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment which would provide for the creation of such a mechanism. Considering the seriousness of the human rights situation in Australian immigration detention centres as revealed in the report, OMCT would call upon the government to reconsider its stance on the Draft Optional Protocol and to support the adoption of the document when it comes before the United Nations’ General Assembly in September.  OMCT would like to urge the government of Australia to carefully consider the conclusions and recommendations made in the Bhagwati report and, where necessary, to modify its legislation and policy in line with the report’s findings. In particular, in the case of the Woomera detention centre, OMCT considers that urgent measures must be taken to bring conditions of detention into line with Australia’s obligations under international law.
