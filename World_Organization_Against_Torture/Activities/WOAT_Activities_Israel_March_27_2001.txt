Brief description of the situation:  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel (PCATI), a member of the OMCT network, of the possible use of illegal interrogation methods against Zaid Orsan Hafez Kilani by the General Security Services.  Zaid Orsan Hafez Kilani had been arrested on 14.2.01 at the site of the car bombing in Wadi Arra.  After his arrest he was detained at the Kishon Detention Center in Ashkelon and then transferred to the surgical ward at the Rambam Hospital in Haifa. According to the information received, Mr. Kilani's legs were amputated.   Background information  According to the information received, an order prohibiting meeting with Counsel was imposed against Mr. Kilani from the time of his arrest, on February 14th 2001, through March 13th 2001. On March 13th 2001, a second order was issued. According to the information received, the PCATI and Mr. Kilani's family are concerned that the order prohibiting meeting with Counsel was not issued on a valid and factual basis but in order to prevent an actual meeting from taking place. PCATI and Mr. Kilani's family are equally concerned that the Order’s objective is to conceal from public view the illegal nature of the interrogation.  On 18.3.2001 PCATI, through its attorney Lea Tsemel filed an urgent petition to the High Court of Justice on behalf of Mr. Kilani demanding that the Order Prohibiting Meeting with Counsel be lifted and that Mr. Kilani be allowed to meet with counsel.  On 19.3.2001 the above mentioned petition was withdrawn after an arrangement was made between the petitioners and the GSS and the State Attorney's office whereby Mr. Kilani's attorney and family can visit him for 45 minutes under the condition that they discuss only personal matters and matters of health and not the Wadi Arra bombing. It was also agreed that Mr. Kilani's close family would receive an entry permit into Israel in order to visit him and that a GSS interrogator will be present during the family's visit.  Mr. Kilani is still under detention and hospitalized at the Rambam Hospital in Haifa.   However, OMCT and PCATI remain concerned of the possible use of illegal interrogation methods against Zaid Orsan Hafez Kilani by the General Security Services.   Action requested  Please write to the authorities in Israel urging them to:  1.	take all necessary measures to guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of Zaid Orsan Hafez Kilani; 2.	guarantee an immediate investigation into the alleged use of illegal interrogation methods of Zaid Orsan Hafez Kilani, identify those responsible, bring them before a civil competent and impartial tribunal and apply the penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions provided by law; 3.	order his immediate release in the absence of valid legal charges or, if such charges exist, bring him before an impartial and competent tribunal and guarantee his procedural rights at all times; 4.	ensure Zaid Orsan Hafez Kilani’s right to meet with his lawyer and relatives; 5.	guarantee full respect of the Israeli 6.9.1999 High Court of Justice ruling prohibiting the use of torture during interrogation as well as of the right not to be subjected to torture as guaranteed in the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment; 6.	guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
