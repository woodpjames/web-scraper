of political prisoners in Azerbaijan, there are currently over 150 such prisoners in the country. The exact
number fluctuates given occasional releases and new arrests. The list contains the names of journalists,
bloggers, editors, religious activists, political activists and others who human rights defenders deem have been
deprived of their liberty on politically motivated grounds. This joint submission of the OMCT and the IPHR describe a few selected cases of
individuals who have been prosecuted, arrested and imprisoned in retaliation for their exercise of freedom of
expression, association and assembly and other fundamental rights. It further highlights a number of cases in
which detainees were tortured or ill-treated.
