Description of the situation: The Observatory has been informed by Chinese Human Rights Defenders (CRD) about the sentencing of Mr. Chen Daojun, a cyber activist and freelance writer based in Jintang Township, Chengdu City, Sichuan Province, to three years of both imprisonment and deprivation of political rights. According to the information received, on November 21, 2008, at 11 a.m., Mr. Chen Daojun was convicted by the Chendu Intermediate People’s Court in Sichuan of “inciting subversion of state power” and sentenced to three years’ of imprisonment and three years’ deprivation of his political rights for posting articles on the Internet supporting the March 2008 Tibetan protesters. On June 13, 2008, Mr. Chen Daojun was formally arrested by the Chengdu City Procuratorate on suspicion of “inciting secession”, for the publication of three articles in support of the Tibetans who protested against the Chinese government in March 2008[1]. However, on May 9, 2008, Mr. Chen Daojun had actually been apprehended for having taken part in a peaceful protest to demand the cessation of the activities of a petrochemical plant located in the surroundings of Chengdu. On May 10, he was officially detained for “inciting subversion of state power”. On November 5, 2008, Mr. Chen Daojun was charged with “inciting secession”, but for unclear reasons, on November 21, the court decided to drop the accusation of secession and to convict Mr. Chen of “inciting subversion” for his articles supporting Tibetan protesters. The Observatory expresses its deep concern with the sentencing and arbitrary detention of Mr. Chen Daojun, which seems to merely sanction his activities of promotion of human rights principles and as such is a flagrant violation of the provisions of the United Nations (UN) Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998. The Observatory further points out that in April 2006, the PRC submitted a document to the UN in order to support its candidacy to the Human Rights Council’s first election, in which it affirmed that amendment had been made to the Constitution to aim at “defining the position of human rights in the overall national development strategy”, and that as a member of the Human Rights Council, the PRC “shall uphold the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights”. Actions required: Please write to the Chinese authorities urging them to:   Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Chen Daojun;  Release Mr. Chen Daojun immediately and unconditionally since his detention is arbitrary as it merely aims at sanctioning his activities in favour of human rights;  Put an end to all acts of harassment, including at the judicial level, against Mr. Chen Daojun as well as all other human rights defenders in China;  Conform with Article 33.3 of the Chinese Constitution that states that “the State respects and safeguards human rights”;  Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, article 6(b), which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others (...) to publish, impart or disseminate to others views, information and knowledge on all human rights and fundamental freedoms”, and its article 8(2), which provides that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to submit to governmental bodies and agencies and organisations concerned with public affairs criticism and proposals for improving their functioning and to draw attention to any aspect of their work that may hinder or impede the promotion, protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms”;  Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by the People’s Republic of China.

Chengdu City Procuratorate prosecuted Mr. Chen on the basis of one of three articles: “the Government Forces the People to Rebel - a Tribute to the Tibetans who Staged a Heroic Struggle”, “What to Do after the 17th Party Congress” and “The Background of Those People Who are Against Westernization”. The Procuratorate alleged that certain words and sentences in these articles “incited secession”.
