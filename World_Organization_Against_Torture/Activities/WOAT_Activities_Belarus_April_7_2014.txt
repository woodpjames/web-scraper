The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of
the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation
Against Torture (OMCT), has received new information and requests your urgent
intervention in the following situation in Belarus. 
 
New
information:
 
The
Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the confirmation in
appeal of the ban of a book written by Mr. Ales Bialiatski, President of the Human Rights
Centre (HRC) “Viasna” and FIDH Vice-President, who is serving 4,5 years’
imprisonment in relation to his human rights activities.
 
According
to the information received, on March 31, 2014, the Hrodna Regional Court
confirmed in appeal the decision of the Ashmiany District Court to forbid the
book entitled “Asvechanyia Belaruschunai” (“Enlightened by Belarusianness”)
written by Mr. Ales Bialiatski.
 
The
panel of judges for civil cases reportedly took only three minutes to announce
its decision, which proves that it was made in advance. Moreover, Judge
Kolesnik, who chaired the case, behaved aggressively, and did not allow the
applicants to speak in full and convey their views to the court.
 
The March 31 decision was issued following an appeal which had been
lodged by Ms. Tatsiana Reviaka, member of the HRC “Viasna”, against a
first instance ruling issued on February 11, 2014 (see background information).
The book is a digest of literary articles and essays on Belarusian
literature, and also features four texts written during detention.
 
The Observatory expresses its concern about the confirmation of the
decision to confiscate the copies of Mr. Bialiatski’s book on biased
grounds, and considers it as a means to further sanction his human rights
activities. 
 
Background
information:
 
On July 3, 2013 40 copies
of the book were confiscated from Ms. Tatsiana Reviaka at the
Belarusian-Lithuanian border checkpoint “Kamenny Loh”. 
 
On July 5, 2013, a notice
was sent to Ms. Tatsiana Reviaka informing her that an examination would be
carried out by the head of the chief department for ideological work, youth and
culture of the Hrodna regional executive committee. 
 
On July 15, Ms. Tatsiana Reviaka sent a petition to
request a copy of the examination order, as well as information about the
qualifications of the expert, including his or her level of education, degree,
professional experience and previous experience of conducting similar
examinations, invoking Article 138 of the Customs Code of the Customs Union,
according to which “a customs examination shall be appointed by the customs
authorities and carried out by customs experts as well as experts from other
authorised organisations”, while the expert may be a person who “possesses the
necessary expertise to give expert opinion”. 
 
From July 24 to 30, two scientists of the Hrodna State University,
composing the expert commission, held an examination, the results of which
acknowledged that the book “could damage the image of the Republic of Belarus”.
 
On August 14, 2013, Ms. Tatsiana Reviaka
expressed concerns to the State Customs Committee that 33 days after the
appointment of the examination (i.e. from July 5 to August 7, 2013), the head
of the Ashmiany Customs Department was still unaware of the expert’s name,
although Part. 2 of Article 139 of the Customs Code provides that the period of
an examination may not exceed 20 working days from the date of submission of
the expert materials, and that such materials should be passed to the expert
during the same working day. 
 
On September 5, 2013, Ms. Tatsiana Reviaka
received the conclusions of an expert examination ordered by the Ashmiany
Customs Department, which alleged that Mr. Ales Bialiatski’s book “could
damage the image of the Republic of Belarus”. 
 
On September 9, 2013, the State Customs Committee replied that the examination
had “started on July 24, 2013” and had in reality been “completed on July 30,
2013”.
 
On September 13, 2013, Ms. Tatsiana Reviaka
filed a complaint to the Chairman of the State Customs Committee, urging him to
conclude on the illegality of both the order for the appointment of the
examination and of its conduct. 
 
On
November 13, 2013, Ms. Tatsiana Reviaka received a response to her complaint
from the State Customs Committee. She appealed against the violations of the
customs officials of the Ashmiany Customs Office during the appointment of an
expert examination of the book.
 
On
January 2, 2014, Ms. Tatsiana Reviaka received a message from the Ashmiany Customs Department that the books must be
re-exported from Belarus. Later she received another message that the books
would be destructed if they were not re-exported before January 21. 
 
On
January 29, 2014, a preliminary hearing was held at the Ashmiany District Court
regarding the lawsuit lodged by Ms. Tatsiana Reviaka against local customs
officials who prohibited the importation of the book “Enlightened by
Belarusianness”. On the day of the preliminary hearing, Ms. Reviaka learned that the
re-examination was conducted from November 20 to December 9, 2013.
 
On February 11, 2014, the Judge of Ashmiany District Court, Ms. Tatsiana
Yemelyanovitch, announced the verdict forbidding the distribution on the
territory of Belarus of the book “Enlightened by
Belarusianness”. Ms. Reviaka lodged an appeal against
the verdict.
