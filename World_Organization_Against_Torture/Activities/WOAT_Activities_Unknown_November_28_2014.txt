“Improving protection and ensuring participation
  of Land and Environment Defenders in all business initiatives and
  discussions”



 



3 December 2014, Room IX, Palais des Nations
8.00-9.30



 
Despite
the increased recognition of the important role played by human rights
defenders, and women in particular, when confronting adverse impacts of
investment projects, much remains to be done to enhance their protection and
participation and to put an end to the abuses they face.
Women
and men who promote and protect land and environment-related human rights still
face in return a large range of abuses committed by State and non-State actors
on all continents. In Latin America, Africa and Asia particularly, those
defenders have been under surveillance, criminalised, slandered, attacked,
arbitrarily detained, harassed or otherwise threatened, and in some cases
killed, in a climate of impunity. Because of this growing and worrying trend,
there is clearly a great need for the international community, States and
businesses to seek concrete ways to actively respect and protect land and
environment defenders.
This
side event therefore aims to encourage all stakeholders to take into account
the special situation – in terms of protection and participation - of
those  who advocate on the respect of
land and environmental rights. It will also address challenges faced by women
and men human rights defenders to access remedy when their rights are violated
and the effectiveness of the remedies on offer.
* The Observatory will be presenting its 2014 Annual
Report entitled: ”We Are not Afraid”. Land Rights Defenders : attacked for
confronting unbridled development.
