The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of
the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and the International Federation
for Human Rights (FIDH), requests your urgent intervention on the following
situation in the People’s Republic of
China.
 
Brief description of the situation:
 
The
Observatory has been informed by Chinese Human Rights Defenders (CHRD) that
human rights defender Mr. Zhu Chengzhi, who has been detained since
June 2012, is at risk of enforced disappearance.

According to the information received, on January 4, 2013, Mr. Zhu Chengzhi’s
legal representative was informed that the
Shaoyang Public Security Bureau decided to subject him to six months of
“residential surveillance” at an undisclosed location, beginning on January 4,
in what may be the first use of Article 73 of the revised Criminal Procedure
Law (CPL), which permits subjecting an individual to “enforced disappearance”[1]. Police
in Hunan have merely notified Mr. Zhu Chengzhi’s family of the “residential
surveillance” on the charge of “inciting subversion of State power”, but
without disclosing his whereabouts or indicating exactly how long he will
serve. Moreover, one of his lawyers, Mr. Liu Xiaoyuan, has been blocked from
visiting him. 
 
Mr. Zhu was arrested by the Shaoyang police on June 8, 2012
after refusing to guarantee that he would stop investigating the cause of death
of labour activist Li Wangyang, who died under suspicious circumstances in June
2012. He was formally arrested on July 25, 2012 on suspicion of “inciting subversion of State power”.
 
The
Observatory expresses its deep concern about the arbitrary detention and risk
of enforced disappearance of Mr. Zhu Chengzhi, which seems to be aimed at sanctioning
his human rights activities. The Observatory fears for his physical and
psychological integrity, and calls upon the Chinese authorities to immediately
and unconditionally disclose his whereabouts and to release him.
 
Actions
requested:

Please write to the authorities in the People’s Republic of China, urging them
to:

i. Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr.
Zhu Chengzhi;

ii. Take prompt action in order to disclose the whereabouts of Mr. Zhu Chengzhi, and
ensure his immediate release, since his detention is arbitrary and
seems to only aim at sanctioning his human rights activities;

iii. Put an end to all forms of harassment, including at the judicial level,
against Mr. Zhu Chengzhi as well as against all human rights defenders
in China;

iv. Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights
Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9,
1998, especially its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right,
individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the
protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the
national and international levels”, and Article 12.2, which provides that “the
State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the
competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others,
against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse
discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his
or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present
Declaration”;

v. Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental
freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and
international instruments ratified by the People’s Republic of China.

[1] Article 73 of the revised CPL,
which went into effect on January 1, 2013, authorizes police to “designate a
place for residential surveillance” for certain criminal suspects, such as
those charged with “endangering State security” crimes, but to not inform the
family if doing so could “interfere with the investigation”.
