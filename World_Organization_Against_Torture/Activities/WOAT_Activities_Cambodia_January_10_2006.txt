New information:The observatory has been informed of the arrest of Mr. Pa Nguon Teang, Deputy Director of the Cambodian Centre for Human Rights (CCHR), and Producer of the CCHR Voice of Democracy radio programme.   According to the information received, on January 3, 2006, Mr. Pa Nguon Teang and Mr. Ou Virak, CCHR public relation officer, went to the villages of the north-eastern province of Stung Treng to meet some local people and discuss about human rights. On January 4, 2006, Mr. Pa Nguon Teang and Mr.Ou Virak, along with another friend (whose name is not available), decided to go to the Cambodian-Laotian border as some of the villages they visited were near the border. As they approached the border checkpoint to see around, they were held by the border police, which then arrested Mr. Pa Nguon Teang. The latter said that the police had his name on a list for arrest ordered by their national police officers.  The police brought back Mr. Pa Nguon Teang to Phnom Penh, and went directly to the Ministry of Interior, where Mr. Pa Nguon Teang was detained during the night.  On January 4, 2006, government spokesman Mr. Khieu Kanharith stated that Mr. Pa Nguon Teang had been detained for interrogation regarding his role in the International Human Rights Day celebration on December 10, 2005 but had not been charged. On the same day, Mr. Muth Mao, head of the police in Stung Treng, confirmed that the CCHR Deputy Director had been arrested at the border checkpoint under orders from the Ministry of Interior but gave no further details.  On January 5, 2006, Mr. Pa Nguon Teang was brought to the Phnom Penh Municipal Court and the Investigating Judge questioned him for about two hours about the banner used by CCHR during the December 10 International Human Rights Day celebration. On the same day, he was charged with criminal defamation and brought to Prey Sar prison near Phnom Penh, where Mr. Kem Sokha, CCHR President, and Mr. Yeng Virak, Director of the Community Legal Education Center (CLEC) and a member of the organising committee of the celebration, are also detained. Both were charged with defamation on December 31, 2005, in connection with banners displayed at the International Human Rights Day event (see background information).  Background information:On December 10, 2005, a group of 63 NGOs, including CCHR and CLEC, organised a celebration of the 57th international human rights day with a gathering including booth displays, where participating NGOs displayed their activities and products. Thousands of people participated in the event, which was guarded by police officers and closely monitored by plain-clothes police officers. One of the booths was occupied by CCHR. It was decorated with old banners, which were used in 2003 and had slogans printed in Khmer script: “My vote is my life” and “I don’t vote for any party that sows fear to the people”.  The banners also had handwritings on them written by the people who participated in CCHR public activities in 2003, some of which allegedly criticised the policies of Cambodian Prime Minister Mr. Hun Sen. At around 11:00 a.m., CCHR staff members manning the booth were informed by the steering committee that the police authorities had complained about the banners displayed at the stall. Upon receiving this information, CCHR staff members decided to remove the banners.  After the arrest of Mr. Kem Sokha, Mr. Pa Nguon Teang took over the management of CCHR as the acting president.  On January 4, 2006, the High Commissioner for Human Rights expressed deep regret over the arrests of Mr. Kem Sokkha et Mr. Yeng Virak.
