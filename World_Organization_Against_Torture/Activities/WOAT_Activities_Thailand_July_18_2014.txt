July 18, 2014
 
The Observatory for the
Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the International
Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation Against Torture
(OMCT), has received new information and requests your urgent intervention in
the following situation in Thailand.
 
New information:
 
The Observatory has been
informed by reliable sources about the release of Mr. Prom Jarana, a
member of the Assembly of the Poor, a grass-roots people’s movement that works
for the protection and promotion of land rights. 
 
According to the information
received, on July 17, 2014 Mr. Prom was released at 8:00 pm. No charges were
brought against him and he is no longer under any ongoing investigation. 
 
Mr. Prom Jarana was detained
for about 10 hours at the Somdet Chaopraya Mahakasatsuk military camp and questioned by soldiers from the Thai 2nd Army about
his involvement in the delegation of the “Assembly of the Poor to Bangkok”. The
interrogation, which took place without the presence of counsel or any other
representative, focused on allegations that he had come to Bangkok to join the
delegation of the Assembly of the Poor (see background information) and brought
back some documents issued by the Assembly of the Poor to the villagers of Kao
Baat. Those documents criticized the military coup and the evictions of
villagers in Non Din Daeng District as a result of the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO) orders Nos. 64 and
66. 
 
The Observatory welcomes the
release and the end of the judicial harassment against Mr. Prom Jarana, and
thanks all the persons, institutions and organisations who intervened in their
favour. However, the Observatory regrets that he was arbitrarily detained for 10
hours.
 
Background
information:
 
Between June 27 and July 2, 2014,
soldiers from the Thai 2nd Army entered six villages, Kao Baat, Saeng Sawan,
Talat Khwai, Pa Mamuang, Klong Hin Mai and Sam Salueng villages in Non Ding
Daeng District, Buriram Province, and ordered residents to demolish their own
homes and leave the area. Soldiers spray-painted the relocation deadlines,
ranging from July 7 to July 10, on the villagers’ homes. Soldiers also warned
villagers that they would be forcibly evicted from their homes if they failed
to comply with their eviction orders. 
 
There were about 300 households
with a total of more than 1,000 people in the six villages affected by the
relocation orders. In Saeng Sawan Village, more than 50 households refused to
relocate. Similarly, about 40 people in Kao Baat Village, mostly women and
children, refused to leave their homes. 
 
The Thai Army did not provide any
compensation or assistance to those who agreed under duress to vacate their
homes. The two relocation sites, located in the rubber plantation area of Pa
Yaang Sabkhaning, about six kilometers north of the Pa Mamuang Village, and at
the Lam Nang Rong Buddhist temple grounds, about 15 kilometres south of Talat
Khwai Village, lack adequate temporary shelters and have no access to water. 
 
The forced evictions were
preceded by a string of arbitrary detentions. On June 28 and 29, soldiers from
the Thai 2nd Army detained a total of 10 village leaders from Seang Sawan
Village. The 10 were held incommunicado without being charged for seven days at
the Somdet Chaophraya Mahakasatsuk military camp and were not informed of the
reason of their detention. 
 
On July 4, 2014, about 20
soldiers from the Thai 2nd Army took a village leader from his home in Lam Nang
Rong Village, Non Din Daeng District, Buriram Province, and detained him at the
Somdet Chaophraya Mahakasatsuk military camp. Mr. Sornram was released
after being held incommunicado for about 10 hours. The day before,
Mr. Sornram had approached local military commanders to ask them whether
the NCPO’s announcement that it would crack down on forest encroachments would
apply to the situation of villagers in Non Din Daeng District. On July 12,
2014, Thai Army soldiers in Saeng Sawang Village briefly detained local
activist Mr. Paiboon Soisot and ordered him to leave the community
or face legal action. 
 
It is believed that the Thai
Army’s crackdown stemmed from Order Nos. 64 and 66, issued by the ruling junta,
the NCPO, on June 14 and 17, 2014 respectively. The two orders empowered government
agencies to take action to put an end to encroachment on forest reserves
nationwide. However, villagers claim that the area they inhabited was no longer
classed as ‘forest reserve’ and should be redistributed among local communities
in accordance with the 1964 National Forest Reserve Act. 
 
The area has a long history of
forced relocation of villagers as part of the Thai government’s military
campaign against Thai Communist Party’s guerrilla operating in the area in the
1970s and early 1980s. In the next two decades, successive Thai governments
failed to return the land to the communities who had originally inhabited it.
 
On July 15, 2014, Mr. Prom joined a delegation of
the Assembly of the Poor to Bangkok. The delegation gathered at the Thai Army headquarters
to demand that the ruling junta, the NCPO, put an end to the ongoing forced
evictions of villagers by soldiers from the Thai 2nd Army in six villages of
Non Din Daeng District, Buriram Province. On
July 16, Mr. Prom visited Kao Baat, one of the villages affected by the forced
evictions.
 
On July 17, 2014, at 10.30
am, Thai police and army personnel arrested Mr. Prom Jarana at his home in Baan
Hoo Tam Nob Village, Phakam District, Buriram Province. The arresting officers
informed Mr. Prom that he would be taken to the Somdet Chaopraya Mahakasatsuk
military camp. Mr. Prom was not informed of the reason for his arrest.
