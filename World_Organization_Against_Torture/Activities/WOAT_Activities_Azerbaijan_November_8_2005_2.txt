Brief description of the situationThe International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Human Rights Centre of Azerbaijan, a member of the OMCT network, that Mr. Natik Efendiyev, former head of the police department of Gyandja, and currently the deputy chairman of the opposition Democratic Party, has been tortured and is currently in hospital in Baku.  According to the information received, Mr. Efendiyev was detained on 17th October 2005, on charges of plotting a coup d’état, and reportedly due to his close relationship to Mr. Rasul Guliyev. He reportedly was beaten and electrocuted. He was held at the organised crime unit of the Interior Ministry. His wife stated that when his lawyer went to visit Mr. Efendiyev, he repeatedly fainted during the meeting and could hardly speak. Furthermore, Mr. Efendiyev’s case has been preliminary tried in the Department of Organised Crimes, instead of in court as required by the law.  Mr. Efendiyev is a former political prisoner and received a pardon from the president in 2004. He was arrested on 17th October, along with Mr. Etibar Guliyev, also a member of the Azerbaijan Democratic Party, and previously a political prisoner pardoned by the president in 2004.  Mr. Rasul Guliyev, leader of the Democratic Party of Azerbaijan, has been accused of embezzlement, charges which seem to be politically motivated. Mr. Guliyev has been living in the United States for several years and declared that he would return to Azerbaijan to run in the presidential elections. The prosecutor-general had said that he would be immediately arrested and jailed if he returned to Azerbaijan.
