New information: The Observatory has been informed by the Gambia Press Union (GPU) about the release of the six trade union leaders and journalists convicted on August 6, 2009, namely Mr. Emil Touray, Ms. Sarata Jabbi Dibba, Mr. Pa Modou Faal, respectively GPU Secretary General, Vice-President and Treasurer, Messrs. Pap Saine and Ebrima Sawaneh, Publisher and Editor of The Point newspaper respectively, as well as Mr. Sam Sarr, Editor of the Foroyaa opposition newspaper. Messrs. Ebrima Sawaneh and Pap Saine are also GPU members. According to the information received, on September 3, 2009, at 9 pm, following presidential pardon, the six journalists were released from the Mile Two State Central Prison, where they had been detained since August 6, 2009 following their conviction for charges of “sedition” and “defamation”. The Observatory thanks all the persons, organisations, and institutions that intervened in favour of the six journalists. Background informations: On June 15, 2009, Ms. Sarata Jabbi-Dibba, Mr. Emil Touray and Mr. Pa Modou Faal were summonsed by the Gambian National Intelligence Agency (NIA) in Banjul for questioning in relation to the statement published by the GPU in The Point and Foroyaa on June 12. They were subsequently arrested. The GPU statement that prompted their arrest criticised Gambian President Yahya Jammeh in relation to comments he had made on June 8 on Government television GRTS, denying any State implication in the murder of prominent Gambian journalist Deyda Hydara, which remains unpunished as of today. The GPU statement also denounced numerous instances of harassment and intimidation of journalists by the Gambian authorities, and deplored the state of media freedom in the country. Furthermore, four other journalists were also arrested by NIA officers in plain clothes on June 15, 2009, namely Mr. Sam Sarr, Mr. Abubakar Saidykhan, Foroyaa reporter, Mr. Ebrima Sawaneh and Mr. Pap Saine. On June 18, 2009, the seven journalists appeared at Kanifing police court and were subsequently charged with “seditious publication”. Messrs. Emil Touray, Pa Modou Fall, Pap Saine and Ebrima Sawaneh, Sam Sarr and Abubakar Saidykhan were then imprisoned in Banjul’s Mile Two jail. Only Ms. Sarata Jabbi-Dibba, mother of a young child, was released on a bail of 200,000 Dalasis (approximately 5,300 Euros). On June 22, 2009, Messrs. Emil Touray, Pa Modou Fall, Pap Saine, Ebrima Sawaneh, Sam Sarr and Abubakar Saidykhan were brought to Kanifing police court in the Banjul suburbs and all were bailed in the sum of 200,000 Dalasis. On July 3, 2009, the seven journalists were summoned to appear before Banjul High Court, charged with the initial charges of sedition and three other counts of defamation. The Court then revoked their initial bail conditions, and sent them back to Mile Two State Central Prison. Hours later, Ms. Sarata Jabbi-Dibba was released with a bail of 400,000 Dalasis (about 10,600 Euros). On July 6, 2009, Messrs. Emil Touray, Pa Modou Fall, Pap Saine Ebrima Sawaneh, Sam Sarr and Abubakar Saidykhan were released on bail of 400,000 Dalasis. On July 28, 2009 Mr. Abubakar Saidykhan was acquitted and discharged over “wrong” charges by the High Court. He was initially arrested for taking photos of his editor being arrested but charged with same counts of sedition and defamation. On August 6, 2009, Messrs. Emil Touray, Pa Modou Faal, Pap Saine, Ebrima Sawaneh and Sam Sarr as well as Ms. Sarata Jabbi Dibba, were convicted and sentenced by Banjul High Court to two years’ imprisonment and to a 250,000 Dalasis (about 6,625 Euros) fine each upon charges of “sedition” and “defamation”. All were transferred to serve their sentence in Mile Two State Central Prison.
