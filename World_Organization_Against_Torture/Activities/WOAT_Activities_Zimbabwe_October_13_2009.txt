New information: The Observatory has been informed by Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights (ZLHR) about the judicial harassment faced by human rights lawyer Alec Muchadehama, who represents several victims of State-sponsored abduction and torture, including Ms. Jestina Mukoko, Executive Director of the Zimbabwe Peace Project (ZPP) and board member of the Zimbabwe Human Rights Forum[1]. According to the information received, on October 14, 2009, Mr. Alec Muchadehama will stand trial at the Harare Magistrates Court (Rotten Row) in court 13 at 8:30 am for alleged contempt of court after having successfully represented several human rights activists, including victims of State-sponsored abduction and torture. Mr. Alec Muchadehama is accused of having secured, in collusion with Ms. Constance Gambara, the Clerk of the High Court Judge Justice Chinembiri Bhunu, the “unlawful release” on bail of Mr. Andrison Manyere, a freelance journalist, and two members of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) on April 17, 2009, detained following their abduction by State security agents in 2008. The State alleges that Mr. Alec Muchadehama “unlawfully and intentionally impaired the dignity, reputation or authority of a court or realising that there was real risk or possibility of impairing the dignity, reputation or authority of a court” by causing the release of the three abductees while he was aware of Justice Bhunu's judgment in which he granted the State leave to appeal against an earlier bail order by Justice Charles Hungwe. On April 15, 2009, human rights lawyer Alec Muchadehama had been arrested by officers of the Law and Order Section of the police at the Rotten Row Magistrates Court on allegations of obstructing the course of justice. On May 15, 2009, he was released on bail after payment of 100 USD. The Observatory expresses its deep concern about the judicial harassment faced by Mr. Alec Muchadehama, and fears that it merely aims at sanctioning his human rights activities. Further, the Observatory urges Zimbabwe authorities to an end to harassment against human rights defenders. Actions required: Please write to the authorities of Zimbabwe urging them to:   Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Alec Muchadehama, as well as of all human rights defenders in Zimbabwe;  Put an end to any kind of harassment, including at the judicial level, against Mr. Alec Muchadehama as well as against all human rights defenders in Zimbabwe;  Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually or collectively, to promote the protection and fulfilment of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, as well as above-mentioned Article 12.2 (“the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure);  Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by Zimbabwe.
