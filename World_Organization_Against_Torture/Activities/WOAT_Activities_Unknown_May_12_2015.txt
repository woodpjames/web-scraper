shared with civil society the 28 April 2015 Joint Communication by the European
Commission and the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign
Affairs and Security Policy for the elaboration of a new Action Plan on Human
Rights and Democracy for the period 2015-2019 (hereafter the Action Plan). 
The undersigned civil society organisations
would like to express their satisfaction that a number of our proposals[1]
have been incorporated to the draft EU Action Plan on Human Rights and
Democracy. Still, many of the concrete, strategic recommendations advanced by
civil society and by Human Rights Defenders (HRDs) themselves, must urgently be
taken forward. Once the Action Plan is finalised with input from various
institutions at European Union (EU) and member state level and from civil
society, the true challenge will be to deliver on these commitments and to make
EU engagement for security, protection and support for Human Rights Defenders a
reality. 
-         
The
Strategic Framework on HR&D adopted in 2012 is recognised in the
introduction of the Action Plan as the embodiment of how the EU planned to
fulfill “its Treaty obligation to advance democracy, the rule of law, as well
as the universality and indivisibility of human rights”. Our organisations
believe that the Action Plan as a whole should reflect this position by
referring more clearly to the planned activities as obligations.
Our organisations find it a positive step that the
new Action Plan pays particular attention to several categories of HRDs in need
of special protection such as those working on economic, social and cultural rights,
those working in rural areas or women HRDs.
-         
Our
organisations would like to suggest that HRDs working on Business and Human
Rights be likewise specifically mentioned in point 9.b since they constitute
one of the most targeted categories of HRD.
-         
The
plan should include specific actions in order to facilitate emergency measures
of protection such as relocation and emergency visas for HRDs.
The draft Action Plan also rightly acknowledges
the role of HRDs as agents of change and explicitly addresses their need for protection
in several parts of the Action Plan. 
-         
At
the same time, we believe the protection of HRDs and the promotion of their key
role must be fully mainstreamed throughout the whole document. The specific
mention of HRDs must be included with respect to the following areas: the
promotion of domestic actors’ participation in reform processes (point 5.a);
the improvement of the quality of consultations organised by the EU at local
level (point 7.c); the promotion of an enabling environment for civil society
(point 10.b); the engagement with civil society for the implementation of the United
Nations Guiding Principles (UNGPs) on business and human rights (point 17.a); the
mainstreaming of human rights in operational guidance for staff of missions
which should explicitly include the particular role and needs of HRDs (point
22.a); the section on trade/investment policy should include
an action on integrating
the protection of HRDs into bilateral and multilateral agreements, making
explicit that space for independent civil society is a prerequisite for
anti-corruption efforts, good governance, effective development or
peace-building (point 24) ; the issue of consultation with relevant stakeholder groups exposed to
major human rights risks within the human rights impact assessment procedures,
where HRDs play a crucial role (point 27.a).
Moreover, our organisations would like to
highlight several critical points that should be included in order to achieve a
systematic and comprehensive approach to HRDs as stated in point 9.a: 
-         
A
coherent and concrete HRD strategy should be developed with the participation
of civil society organisations, including a vision for short-term action by the
EU as well as more nuanced tools for the mid and long-term cases. 
-         
In
order to ensure a more systematic follow-up to individual cases as provided in
action 30.b, actions taken on human rights defenders' cases by the EU and
member states at headquarters and in delegations should be tracked and
documented through a centralised system of follow-up.
-         
This
strategy must feature specific, targeted measures to respond to the detention
of HRDs, including a commitment to develop a clear communication policy and to define
explicit benchmarks and decision-making processes on how the EU will advocate
strongly, effectively and consistently for the release of arbitrarily arrested
or imprisoned HRDs. Similarly, in Action number 10 on “Addressing threats to
NGO space”, the EU and its member states must make a specific commitment to
oppose unjustified criminalisation of HRDs though public and private messaging.
-         
The
EU and member states should assist and support governments and promote
participation of local civil society in developing
and implementing public policies and mechanisms for the protection of HRDs;
and/or in advocating for the amendment or abrogation of restrictive laws; and
in the fight against impunity for human rights violations committed against
HRDs
-         
In
the new Action Plan and in its concrete strategy on HRDs, the EU and its member
states should pledge to play a leading role on the international arena
regarding HRDs and adopt a pro-active stance that goes beyond solely
“continuing to support and cooperate with international mechanisms” and
“enhancing support for multilateral initiatives on HRDs”. 
-          A
very strong message in this regard would be a commitment to dedicate an annual Foreign
Affairs Council meeting to the discussion of EU and member state efforts to achieve
the release of jailed HRDs, issuing conclusions on present and planned
engagement on HRDs as well as mentioning the most prominent and emblematic cases
faced throughout the year.Finally, our organisations regret that no public
assessment of the previous Action Plan has been carried out which we consider as
a missed opportunity. Consequently,
we would also like to point out that the Action Plan must include a detailed methodology
and a strategy detailing objectives, responsibilities and timeframes. Such an
approach will enable the EU and member states to better deliver on their
commitments on HRDs in the EU Guidelines, the Council Conclusions of June 2014
and this new Action Plan. In addition, this will also allow for meaningful and
effective monitoring and evaluation throughout the four years of implementation:
-         
A
strategy with more precise objectives, action points, attribution of
responsibilities, timeframes, benchmarks and indicators must be developed to
define EU and member state work to protect and support HRDs. All efforts should
be made to attribute specific responsibilities to specific actors within the
EU, to reinforce delivery on commitments, and to promote accountability, monitoring,
evaluation and follow up of the EU Action Plan.
-         
The
EU and member state strategy, along with annual or bi-annual working plans with
specific and measurable actions, must be developed and shared with civil
society organisations in order to ensure the complete fulfillment of the
commitments included in the Action plan. A regular exchange with civil society
and with HRDs on the progress of work under the Action plan (and related
strategies / working plans) will be vital to ensuring transparency,
accountability and relevance of EU and member state work with HRDs.
-         
Any
monitoring and evaluation strategy for this Action plan should recognise the key
role civil society organisations should play in such a process in order to ensure
transparency and to promote the sharing of best practices among different EU and
member state bodies involved in the implementation of the action plan.
We welcome your engagement to support human rights
defenders worldwide and look forward to continuing our positive dialogue to
ensure EU and member state action to promote and protect their vital work.
