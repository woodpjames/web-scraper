Brief description of the situation The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Russian-Chechen Friendship Society (RCFS), a member of OMCT SOS-Torture Network, of the death under unclear circumstances of 20-year-old Mr. Anton Stradymov, an activist involved with the banned National Bolshevik Party[1], on 14 January 2009, in Moscow. According to the information received, Mr. Anton Stradymov was found in a critical condition near the Vykhino metro station in Moscow on 14 January 2009 and brought to hospital where he later died. His body was reportedly covered with blows; in particular his face was crashed, impeding a prompt identification. According to the same information, his belongings had not been stolen. Mr. Anton Stradymov had reportedly taken part in a number of opposition demonstrations, including in the Marches of Dissent organised by “The Other Russia” coalition[2]. The International Secretariat of OMCT is very much concerned about the death of Mr. Anton Stradymov, fearing it may have been politically motivated. OMCT had already documented the cases of Mr. Yura Chervochkin, a Parliamentary candidate list of “The Other Russia” and member of the banned National Bolshevik Party, who had been beaten up to death by alleged members of UBOP, a special detachment to combat organised crime, in Serpukhov town (Moscow region) in December 2007 (See OMCT UA RUS 141207) as well as the case of Mr. Artyom Basyrov, also member of the banned National Bolshevik Party and "The Other Russia", who had been forced to psychiatric internment in November 2007 (see OMCT UA RUS 121207). OMCT is further concerned that the investigation reportedly launched might not be impartial and thorough and therefore alls on the authorities to order a prompt, thorough, impartial and independent investigation into the circumstances of his death, as provided in the Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions, in order to identify those responsible, bring them to trial and apply the penal and/or administrative sanctions as provided by law. Action requested Please write to the authorities of the Russian Federation urging them to:   Order a prompt, thorough, impartial and independent investigation into the death of Mr. Anton Stradymov, in order to identify all those responsible, bring them to trial and apply the civil, penal and/or administrative sanctions as provided by law;  Guarantee adequate reparation to the victim’s family;  Guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
