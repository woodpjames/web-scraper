Brief description of the situation: The Observatory has been informed by the SOVA Centre about the intensification of threats and acts of harassment against Mr. Alexander Verkhovsky, Chairman of the SOVA Centre, a human rights NGO and think tank that conducts sociological research on development of nationalism and racism in Russia. According to the information received, on February 21, 2009, individuals managed to enter Mr. Verkhovsky’s building for the second time since the beginning of 2009, and were able this time to reach the door of his flat. An investigation was launched in order to identify those individuals but it had still not led to any result as of February 25. This event takes place amid increasing and worrying threats and attacks against human rights defenders working on anti-racism and xenophobia in Russia, and in particular against members of the SOVA Centre. The Observatory recalls in this regard the direct threats on the physical integrity of Ms. Galina Kozhevnikova, Deputy Director of the SOVA Centre, on February 8, 2009, a few days before the launching of a report of the SOVA Centre on nationalism and racial issues in Russia, as well as the recent assassinations of human rights defenders in Moscow[1]. The Observatrory also recalls that the SOVA Centre is preparing to launch a reference book on Russian nationalist organisations, on March 2, 2009. In this context, the threats against Mr. Verkhovsky and Ms. Kozhevnikova have to be considered with the utmost seriousness. The Observatory also underlines that on April 17, 2008, a worrying article was published on the extremist website www.vdesyaktu.net, accusing some journalists of defaming the skinheads, and considering that “radio and TV journalists are Jewish”, and that “their elimination should be a top priority”[2]. The article ended with a web-link leading to a list of 34 journalists and human rights defenders working on minority issues, racism and fascism, including Mr. Verkhovsky. For most of the individuals appearing on the list, personal information such as home address, telephone number, and pictures were displayed. In August 2008, a criminal inquiry was opened for “disclosure of personal data” and “death threats”, which had not led to any result as of the beginning of 2009. In the light of these worrying elements, the Observatory urges the Russian authorities to carry out an immediate, thorough and impartial investigation into all the above-mentioned facts, in order to identify all those responsible for the threats against - and violation of the privacy of - Mr. Verkhovsky,. When those responsible for these threats are identified, the Observatory urges the Russian authorities to bring them in the shortest delays before a competent and impartial tribunal and apply to them the penal sanctions provided by the law. The Observatory also recalls that according to OP 2(iv.) of the Council of Europe (CoE) Declaration on Human Rights Defenders[3], member-States shall “take effective measures to prevent attacks on or harassment of human rights defenders, ensure independent and effective investigation of such acts and to hold those responsible accountable through administrative measures and/or criminal proceedings”. Accordingly, the Observatory calls upon the Commissioner for Human Rights of the CoE to act in accordance with operative paragraph 4 of the CoE Declaration on Human Rights Defenders with regards to this situation. The Observatory further urges the European Commission Delegation as well as European Union (EU) Member-States embassies in the Russian Federation to call upon the Russian authorities to comply with the relevant international norms and standards and take action on the above-mentioned threats and acts of harassment, in line with the EU Guidelines on Human Rights Defenders. The Observatory recalls that the Russian Federation was elected to the Human Rights Council in June 2006 for three years and is committed, in this regard, to “uphold the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights”. In addition, as a participating State of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the Russian Federation acknowledges that “the [1998] UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders [... places] a responsibility [...] on states to adopt and implement adequate legislation and administrative procedures that would provide for a conducive environment for human rights defenders to promote and strive for the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, and recognises “the need for particular attention, support and protection for human rights defenders by the OSCE, its Institutions and field operations, as well as by participating States”[4]. Actions requested: The Observatory urges the authorities of the Russian Federation to:   Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Alexander Verkhovsky and Ms. Galina Kozhevnikova, all members of the SOVA Center as well as all human rights defenders in the Russian Federation;  Carry out an immediate, thorough and impartial investigation into the above-mentioned threats and acts of harassment, in order to identify all those responsible for the threats against - and violation of the privacy of - Mr. Verkhovsky and Ms. Kozhevnikova, bring them before a competent and impartial tribunal and apply to them the penal sanctions provided by the law;  Put an end to all acts of harassment against all human rights defenders in the Russian Federation, and ensure in all circumstances that they be able to carry out their work without unjustified hindrances;  Comply with all the provisions of the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, in particular with Article 1, which provides that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, as well as with Article 12.2 (“the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”);  Comply with the provisions of the Document of the Copenhagen Meeting of the 2nd Conference on the Human Dimension of the Cooperation and Security Conference in Europe (CSCE) (1990), and uphold in all circumstances the principles and provisions enshrined in the international and regional human rights instruments ratified by the Russian Federation and which, in particular, guarantee freedoms of association, demonstration, expression and opinion, in particular the European Convention on Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights;  More generally, ensure in all circumstances the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with international and regional human rights instruments ratified by the Russian Federation.
