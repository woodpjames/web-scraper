Brief description of the situation: The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by Advocacy Forum about the forced recruitment by the Maoists on 12th January 2007 of Shiva K. C. alias Tilak Bahadur K. C.(15 years old), Tika Ram Niure (15 years old), and Ramesh Pariyar (15 years old). According to the information received, a Maoists cultural group had been staying in the victims’ village (Baglung Municipality -7, Chharikhola) from 23rd December 2006. For the period they stayed in the village (about one month), the Maoists ate and slept in villagers’ houses. They opened a training camp for cultural programs. According to villagers and parents’ victims’ testimonies, early in the morning physical and cultural trainings were given. Whereas some adolescents left the camp after to go to school the rest of the day, others stayed for further training. Finally, after attending the training camp for weeks, and tempted by Maoists’ promises of a salary, on 12th January 2006, Tilak, Tka and Ramesh did not come back at home and joined the Maoist group, despite their parents’ disapproval. The Maoists’ leader Nar Bahadur B.K. told that the three boys had joined the Maoists “to shape their future”. He said they could not be contacted right then and that families and villagers would only be able to see the three boys the next time the cultural troop will come in the village. OMCT recalls that a lot of children have been used in the conflict between the Maoists and the governmental army and continue being forcefully recruited, despite the Peace Agreement signed on 21st November 2006 between the two parties. Action Requested: Please write a letter to the authorities in Nepal urging them to:  Immediately locate the whereabouts of the three boys and ensure their comeback in their homes; Respect and implement the Peace Agreement between Government of Nepal and Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) signed on 21 November 2006 requesting that “Both sides shall not recruit additional armed forces” (para. 5.1.2) and that “Both sides fully agree to protect the rights of the women and children in a special way, to immediately stop all types of violence against women and children, including child labour as well as sexual exploitation and abuse. They also fully agree not to include or use children who are 18 years old and below in the armed force. Children thus affected would be instantaneously rescued and necessary and suitable assistance would be provided for their rehabilitation” (para.7.6.1).
