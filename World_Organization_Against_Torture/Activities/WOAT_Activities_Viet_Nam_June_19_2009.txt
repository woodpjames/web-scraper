Le Cong Dinh is a prominent human rights lawyer and the former vice-president of the Ho Chi Minh City Bar Association. He has recently spoken out against the extraction of bauxite in the Central Highlands, and has also called for political reform in Vietnam. On 13 June 2009, Le Cong Dinh was arrested by Public Security Police at his office in Ho Chi Minh City and later charged with "conducting propaganda" against the State, under Article 88 of the Vietnamese Penal Code (VPC). He faces a possible sentence of up to 20 years in prison if convicted on this charge. At a press conference, following the arrest, the Investigation Agency of the Ministry of Public Security stated that Le Cong Dinh had "connived with overseas subversives to publish documents distorting the socio-economic policies" of the government.  Front Line and the Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders believe that the arrest of Le Cong Dinh is directly related to his work in the defence of human rights. Front Line and the Observatory are seriously concerned for the physical and psychological integrity of Le Cong Dinh while in detention. Front Line and the Observatory urge you to call on the authorities in Vietnam to:  Immediately and unconditionally release Le Cong Dinh, as we believe that he is being held solely as a result of his legitimate and peaceful work for the defence of human rights; Carry out an immediate, thorough and impartial investigation into the arrest of Le Cong Dinh; Ensure that the treatment of Le Cong Dinh, while in detention, adheres to all those conditions set out in the ‘Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment, adopted by UN General Assembly resolution 43/173 of 9 December 1988´; Take all necessary measures to guarantee the physical and psychological security and integrity of Le Cong Dinh; Guarantee in all circumstances that human rights defenders in Vietnam are able to carry out their legitimate human rights activities without fear of reprisals, and free of all restrictions including judicial harassment;  Yours sincerely,     Mary Lawlor                 Front Line Director  Souhayr Belhassen              FIDH President Eric SOTTAS             OMCT Secretary General
