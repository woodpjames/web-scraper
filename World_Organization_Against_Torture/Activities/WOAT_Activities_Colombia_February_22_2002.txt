Brief description of the situation   The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by a reliable source of the various acts of harassment to which members of the communities of Autodeterminacion, Vida y Dignidad at Cacarica basin, in the department of Chocó have been subjected, among them, the assassination of Mr. Ramiro Vásquez.   According to the information received, from February 19th, 2002, paramilitary groups of the Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia (AUC) have been present in the area inhabited by these communities.  That same day, two members of the community where detained when they working on the land.  One of them was released the next day after having been interrogated several hours.  According to the report, on February 8th, 2002, Mr. Ramiro Vásquez, a well-known member of the community, was assassinated by one of these paramilitary groups.  Furthermore, other members of the community where allegedly detained by the paramilitary, and one of them was subjected to torture.  The paramilitary reportedly threatened the community with incursion in the next 15 days.   According to the information received, the community of Cacarica had been displaced in February 1997, by a joint operation of the armed forces and the paramilitary.  This displacement extended over a period of four years, and the members of the community were provisionally accommodated in Turbo, Urabá, Chocó, and the neighbouring country Panama.  According to the report, during this period they negotiated the conditions for their return with the government in a series of different phases that concluded on March 2001.  A few months after their return, starting on June, 2001, armed men who reportedly identified themselves as belonging to the AUC, infiltrated into the community in order to subject its members to their economic projects involving coke and African palm crops.  The International Secretariat of OMCT shares its concern, along with various human rights organisations, for the security and physical and psychological integrity of all inhabitants in the communities of Autodeterminación, Vida y Dignidad in the Cacarica basin, in the department of Chocó, as it is well known that in other regions of the country, this type of situations have led to massacres, forced dissapearances, executions, and displacements.  Furthermore, OMCT is deeply concerned by the general persecution experienced by the civilian population, the apparent impunity enjoyed by the perpetrators of these frequent human rights violations, as well as the absence of effective protective measures by municipal and national authorities to prevent such acts.   Action requested  Please write to the authorities in Colombia urging them to:  ·	take all necessary measures to guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of all inhabitants of the communities of Autodeterminación, Vida y Dignidad in the Cacarica basin, and in general of all the inhabitants of the department of Chocó, and take all the necessary measures to prevent a massacre from happening in the region;   ·	order a thorough and impartial investigation into the circumstances of these events  in order to identify those responsible, bring them to trial and apply the penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions as provided by law;  ·	carry out immediately the given recommendations by international and regional human rights organisations , including the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Commission for Human Rights of the United Nations, and the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights;  ·	guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
