NGO report to UN experts says still no
prosecution of torturers in Israel; blames « necessity defence » 2 May 2016 – Israel continues to use torture and not to prosecute
offenders in the name of “necessity defence”, the Public Committee Against
Torture in Israel (PCATI) and World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT)
denounced in a report published ahead of the United Nations’ review of the State’s
application of the Convention Against Torture.The UN Committee Against Torture (UNCAT), a body of human rights experts monitoring the
implementation of the Convention by States parties, will on 3-4 May 2016 examine how Israel has complied with the
Convention in the last seven years. In their joint report, PCATI and OMCT say Israel has not implemented the UNCAT experts’ last recommendations
as Israeli
security forces continue to use torture. While 1,000 complaints for beatings, sleep deprivation, holding in stress
positions and sexual abuse during ISA interrogations have been submitted since 2001, not a single
criminal investigation has taken place.In 2009, the UNCAT had already recommended Israel does
not use the “necessity defence” argument as a justification for the use of force as a
last resort in order to prevent real injury to human life, in particular in so-called “ticking time bomb”
situations where “life-saving information” supposedly
can only be obtained by force. “The ticking
time bomb is a fake scenario,” said Gerald Staberock, OMCT Secretary General.
“There is no place for a “necessity defence” under international law.”In the last two years alone, Israel-based PCATI
received 68 allegations regarding the use of different stress positions,
including the “banana” position, which causes pain and neuro-skeletal
damage. Victims held in this position, which exposes the genitals, are also at
high risk for sexual abuse. Culture of
impunity for torturersThe country’s ISA Law 5762-2002 exempts
ISA employees from “criminal or civil
responsibility for any act or omission performed in good faith and reasonably
(…) within the scope and in performance of” their duty, de facto nullifying any prosecution of ISA interrogators accused of torture.  Despite Israel’s ratification of the
Convention in 1991, this culture of impunity extends to
soldiers who resort to ill-treatment throughout the country and the Occupied
Palestinian Territories as well as the police whose use of violence is especially
targeted against Palestinians, Ethiopians and asylum seekers. Yet this violence
rarely results in any investigation or prosecution of the perpetrators or any
reparation for the victims.The UNCAT meets in
Geneva three times a year and examines States’ implementation of and
compliance with the Convention on the basis of reports received from the
State party as well as from other, independent sources including reports
from non-governmental organizations such as PCATI and OMCT.   __________________________________The 57th session proceedings will be
