The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of
the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation
Against Torture (OMCT), has received new information and requests your urgent
intervention in the following situation in
Thailand.
 
New
information:
 
The
Observatory has been informed by reliable sources of the release on bail of Mr.
Thammarat Aliartae, a Malayu Thai human rights defender in Yala province
in southern Thailand.
 
According
to the information received, on September 24, 2012, the Court of Lower
Instances decided the release on bail of Mr. Thammarat Aliartae after four days
of detention at a Taskforce 11 military base. He had been detained under the
1914 Martial Law Act[1]..
 
During
the questioning, the officials only mentioned that they had new DNA evidence
against him related to a bomb attack that took place on August 30, 2007, in
relation to which charges against him remain pending following his release on
bail in 2010 (see background information).
 
During
the interrogation, Mr. Aliartae was reportedly asked to point out the persons
he knew on pictures that were showed to him, and was further required to sign a
report of his testimony that differed from his statements.
 
The
Observatory welcomes the release on bail of Mr. Thammarat Aliartae and thanks
all the persons, institutions and organisations who intervened in his favour.
However, as his judicial harassment continues, the Observatory remains deeply
concerned about future developments regarding this case.
 
Consequently,, the
Observatory calls upon the authorities of Thailand to put an end to the
continuing judicial harassment of Mr. Thammarat Aliartae as well as of all
human rights defenders in the country, as it is arbitrary and seems to merely aim at sanctioning his legitimate
human rights activities.
 
Background information:
 
On
September 20, 2012, at approximately 7.00pm, soldiers from Yala Task Force 11,
a special unit of the Thai army, arrested Mr. Aliartae near his house at the
Old Market in Yala town. He was detained in a military base operated by Yala
Task Force 11 in Muang district in Yala[O1]  and was denied access to his lawyer from his arrest until approximately
9.00am on September 21, when his lawyer finally gained access to him. Task
Force 11 reportedly did not inform Mr. Aliartae or his lawyer of the reason for
his arrest.
 
Five
days before his arrest, on September 15, 2012, Mr. Aliartae, along with current
and former defendants in security-related cases and their families, submitted
complaint letters to and met with officials from the Southern Border Province
Administrative Center (SBPAC). At this meeting, Mr. Aliartae requested Pol.
Col. Tawee Sodsong, the Director General of SBPAC, to ensure people’s equal
access to justice. He also asked SBPAC to provide protection to defendants
released on bail or those already acquitted by the court in security-related
cases because these persons had been harassed, intimidated and sometimes
subjected to physical violence by security forces and unidentified persons.
After the SBPAC meeting, Mr. Aliartae gave interviews to Thai-language media
and his comments were published online.
 
The
meeting followed three recent fatal shootings of current or former defendants
in security-related cases in the southern border provinces. The incident
occurred on July 26, 2012, when Mr. Abduloh Jaetimae was shot dead by
unidentified gunmen in Tambon Yaha, Yala province. Mr. Jaetimae had been
arrested and prosecuted in 2006 for his alleged involvement in planting a bomb
in a bank; after spending three years in detention pending the outcome of his
trial, he was acquitted and released in 2010. 

 
Mr.
Aliartae is a schoolteacher in Yala town, Yala province. In 2007, Mr. Aliartae,
then a university student, was arrested along with six others under the special
security laws and accused of being involved in a bombing in Yala. He reported
having been ill treated while in detention. He was later released on bail in
2010, but his trial has not been concluded and the charges against him still
stand. Mr. Aliartae has since been advocating for the rights of persons
affected by the implementation of special security laws (the Martial Law, the
Emergency Decree, and the Internal Security Act), and by abuses perpetrated by
State security forces in the southern border provinces. 
 
Actions requested:
 
Please write to the Thai
authorities and ask them to:
 
i.  Put an end to all acts of harassment,
including at the judicial level, against Mr.
Thammarat Aliartae, as well as against all other human rights defenders in the
country; 
 
ii.  
Guarantee
in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Aliartae
and of all human rights
defenders and their organisations in Thailand;
 
iii. Conform with the provisions of the
Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted on December 9, 1998 by the
United Nations General Assembly, and in particular :
-     
Article
1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually or in association
with others, to promote the protection and realization of human rights and
fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, 
-   
 and Article 12.2 which provides that “the State
shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent
authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against
any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination,
pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her
legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”.
 
iv. Ensure in all
circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance
with international human rights standards and international instruments
ratified by Thailand.
