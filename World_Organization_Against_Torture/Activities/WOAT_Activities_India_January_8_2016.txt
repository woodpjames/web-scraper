The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of
the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and the International Federation
for Human Rights (FIDH), has received new information and requests your urgent
intervention in the following situation in India. 

New information:

The
Observatory has been informed by Banglar Manabadhikar Suraksha Mancha (MASUM)
of the release on bail and ongoing judicial harassment of Mr. Ajimuddin Sarkar, a District Human Rights Monitor (DHRM) for MASUM in Murshidabad
district (West Bengal, India). Mr. Sarkar is a renowned human rights defender
who has investigated cases of human rights violations perpetrated by the police
and Border Security Forces (BSF), and who has been instrumental in denouncing
several other human rights violations in Murshidabad district.

According
to the information received, Mr. Ajimuddin Sarkar was arbitrarily arrested on
September 22, 2015[1]
(see background information). Shortly after his arrest, two criminal cases were
filed against him: the first on September 23, 2015[2],
and the second on September 29, 2015, on allegations of rape[3].

On
November 27, 2015, Mr. Ajimuddin Sarkar was granted bail[4]
in relation to the first criminal case, but was not released on that day as the
other case was still pending against him. 

It
is only on December 8, 2015 that Mr. Sarkar was finally released on bail
pursuant to the second case, since the de facto complainant filed an
affidavit stating that she did not bring any allegation of rape against Mr.
Sarkar and she had no knowledge of the related criminal case against him.  
Mr.
Sarkar is currently receiving medical treatment, both physical and
psychological, as his mental and physical health conditions deteriorated
significantly during the past months in detention.

The Observatory welcomes the release on bail
of Mr. Sarkar, but condemns the ongoing judicial harassment by the Islampur
Police against him, as well as against other members of MASUM, which seems to
be aimed only at punishing them for their legitimate and peaceful human rights
activities. In fact, the Islamur Police abducted and filed charges against Mr.
Sarkar just days after he and MASUM had filed a case against the head of the
Islampur Police Station for torture and custodial death[5].

The Observatory
recalls that it is not the first time Mr. Sarkar has been intimidated,
judicially harassed and ill-treated by the police (see background information).

More
generally, the Observatory expresses its deepest concern for the widespread
judicial harassment suffered by MASUM’s personnel, including its Secretary, Mr.
Kirity Roy, as well as other
District Human Rights Monitors (DHRM) in several West Bengal districts. For
instance, Mr. Mohar Ali Mondal, DHRM
in District-North 24 Parganas, was detained in Swarupnagar Police Station in
the month of July 2014 without any lawful reason[6].
Furthermore, on August 6, 2015, Mr. Durbadal
Majumdar, DHRM in Jalpaiguri District, was also detained in New Jalpaiguri
Police Out Post from 3.30 p.m. to 10.30 a.m. of the following day, without any
lawful reason[7]. In
addition, MASUM’s pro-bono lawyer Mr. Rana
Mahanta, who was defending among others the case of the widowed Ms. Bewa,
has also been repeatedly threatened by unknown police personnel to withdraw the
complaint regarding the custodial death of her husband against the accused
police personnel.

Accordingly,
the Observatory calls on the Indian authorities to put an end to the ongoing
and persistent attempts to criminalise members of MASUM, in contravention of
their international engagements regarding the protection of human rights
defenders.

Background information:

On November 21, 2014, law enforcement agents from the
Raninagar Police Station arrested Mr. Sarkar at his place of residence and
transferred him to the ACJM Court, Lalbagh. Mr. Sarkar was reportedly arrested
pursuant to an arrest warrant for a pending criminal case under the Passport
Act[8]. 

On May 20, 2014, Mr. Sarkar had filed an application
before the ACJM Court, Lalbagh, expressing his concern that he had been falsely
implicated in an unknown criminal case by the police and the BSF, and requesting
more details about such case. However, until the arrest, Mr. Sarkar did not
receive any information about the status of the said criminal case, neither did
he receive any summons from the police nor the court. 
Mr. Sarkar was reportedly assaulted, abused and mistreated by the police
during his arrest as well as in custody. 

On November 22, 2014, Mr. Sarkar was admitted to Lalbagh Sub-Divisional
Hospital and referred to Berhampore New General Hospital on November 27, 2014, for medical treatment following the injuries suffered
in custody. On November 28, 2014, he was taken to Kolkata for advanced medical
treatment. On November 29, 2014, he underwent psychiatric counselling; the
medical report stated that he had several injuries such as a suspected fractured
rib, as well as post traumatic stress, a tear
on a ligament on his left leg, a feeling of
humiliation, intense anxiety, fear and a feeling of sadness and helplessness.
He suffered from insomnia and his doctors expressed their concern that the attack
could have long-term effects on his psychological health. Mr. Sarkar went to
Calcutta Medical College and Hospital for further treatment on December 3,
2014. To this date, Mr. Sarkar is still undergoing physiotherapy sessions.

On November 23, 2014, Mr. Sarkar’s
son filed a complaint to the local Police Superintendent Murshidabad urging the
police to carry out an investigation into the beatings his father had been
subjected to while in police custody. However, to this date, no information
could be obtained regarding any enquiry or investigation following the
complaint[9].

Two other cases against Mr. Sarkar, namely the
“Raninagar Police Station Case No. 354/2013” and the “Domkal Police Station
Case No. 1243/2014”, are also ongoing. A Criminal Revision at Calcutta High
Court was filed to quash the criminal case pending against Mr. Sarkar at
Raninagar Police Station. 

Furthermore,
on September 22, 2015 at 10.27 a.m., Mr. Sarkar was abducted in Sekhpara
(Murshidabad, West Bengal) by five to seven police officers from the Islampur
Police Station who were not wearing their uniform. At the time of the incident,
Mr. Sarkar was talking with victims of torture and their family members when,
all of a sudden, the police officers arrived in a car and started beating and
insulting him after which they lifted him, placed him inside the vehicle and
took him away. 

On
September 23, 2015, at 1.38 p.m., Mr. Sarkar was taken before the Additional
District and Sessions Judge (2nd
Court)[10]
in Berhampore-Murshidabad and a criminal case was opened against him under
Sections 376, 511, 323, 506 and 400 of the Indian Criminal Code and under
Sections 8 and 12 of the Act for Protection of Children from Sexual Offences
Act. During the arrest he was slapped, kicked and pounced on the chest as well
as verbally abused. He was not permitted to have his medicine and he was not
given food at night. 

Furthermore
he was obliged to walk barefoot and was brought before the Court in this
condition. At 6.15 p.m. on the same day, a petition for bail was rejected and
Mr. Sarkar was then transferred to the prison Berhampore Central Correctional
Home.

MASUM has filed several complaints regarding
the harassment of its members and has been regularly sharing information with
the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC). Regarding previous incidents with
Mr. Sarkar and other MASUM members, the Focal Point on Human Rights Defenders
(HRDs) at the NHRC called MASUM and informed them that they had taken up the
case and sought a report from the relevant police and civil administration, but
up to this date no documents have been shared with MASUM and no appropriate
action has reportedly been taken. 

On September 22, 2015,
immediately following Mr. Sarkar's abduction, MASUM filed a brief complaint
with a request for urgent measures from the NHRC and contacted the Focal Point
of the NHRC on HRDs. However, as of issuing this Urgent Appeal, no actions have reportedly been taken over
the allegations of police abuse upon Mr. Sarkar.
