Re: Concern about the approval in first reading by the Legislative 
Assembly of Saint Petersburg of a bill that could curtail human rights 
defenders' activities on the territory of St Petersburg
 
Dear members of the Legislative Assembly of Saint 
Petersburg,
 
The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint 
programme of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World 
Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), is writing to you regarding the decision 
taken on November 16, 2011 by the members of the Legislative Assembly of Saint 
Petersburg to approve in first reading a bill providing administrative liability 
for public activities “promoting homosexuality, lesbianism, bisexuality and 
transgenderism among minors”.
 
This bill, which aims at amending the Law “on administrative 
violations in St Petersburg”, was introduced to the Legislative Assembly of St 
Petersburg on November 10, 2011. The bill provides administrative liability for 
public activities promoting the rights of lesbians, gays, bisexuals and 
transgender (LGBT), and could lead to fines of up to the equivalent of 1,600 USD 
for “public actions aimed at propaganda of sodomy, lesbianism, bisexuality, and 
transgenderism among minors". This could result in prohibition of certain 
activities of promotion of LGBT rights.
 
The Observatory warns that the entry into force of such a bill would 
breach the prohibition of discrimination and the rights of freedom of opinion 
and expression recognised in the Russian Constitution as well as in 
international and regional instruments ratified by the Russian Federation, such 
as Articles 8, 10 and 14 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human 
Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (i.e. rights to private and family life, freedom 
of opinion and expression and prohibition of 
discrimination).
 
The Observatory also highlights that such a text would also violate 
the provisions of the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, and 
in particular  Article 6  (b) and (c) which states that “Everyone has 
the right, individually and in association with others [...] freely to publish, 
impart or disseminate to others views, information and knowledge on all human 
rights and fundamental freedoms";  "to 
study, discuss, form and hold opinions on the observance, both in law and in 
practice, of all human rights and fundamental freedoms and, through these and 
other appropriate means, to draw public attention to those matters”, as well as 
Article 12.2 which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to 
ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and 
in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto 
or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a 
consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the 
[...] Declaration”.

Accordingly, the Observatory respectfully requests the Legislative 
Assembly of Saint Petersburg to vote down the bill mentioned above, and to 
prevent any other bill or initiative that would limit the rights to promote LGBT 
rights and to fight against any kind of discrimination.
 
We express our sincere hope that you will take these considerations 
and requests into account.
 
Yours sincerely,
