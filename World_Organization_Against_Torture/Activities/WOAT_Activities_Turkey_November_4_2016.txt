The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of
the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation
Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent intervention in the following
situation in Turkey.
Description
of the situation:
The
Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the arrest and
arbitrary detention of Dr. Serdar Küni, Cizre Representative of the
Human Rights Foundation of Turkey (TİHV) and former President of the Şırnak
Chamber of Medicine and the release of Mr. Ismail Akbulut, President of
Hakkâri Branch of Human Rights Association (İHD). 
According
to the information received, on October 19, 2016, Dr. Serdar Küni appeared
before the Cizre Prosecutor to testify, pursuant to an arrest warrant
previously issued against him. He was arrested on the spot. His arrest is
apparently linked with his work as a physician, providing health service in
Cizre which witnessed intensified armed conflict [1]. He
is currently being held in the prison of Şırnak within the framework of an
investigation on accusations of “providing treatment to alleged militants”,
under Article 314/2 of Penal Code of Turkey. 
On
October 18, 2016, Ismail Akbulut was brought to the Hakkari
Security Directorate for questioning, before being
released on October 29. He would not have been charged as of issuing this
urgent appeal, and the official grounds for his arrest and detention have not
been provided.
The Observatory
strongly condemns the ongoing arbitrary detention of Dr. Serdar Küni as well as the arrest of Mr. Akbulut,
as they seem to only aim at sanctioning his legitimate human rights activities.

Accordingly, the
Observatory calls upon the Turkish judicial authorities to immediately and
unconditionally release Dr.
Serdar Küni, and to more generally comply in all circumstances with
international law standards.
Actions
requested:
Please
write to the authorities in Turkey, urging them to:
i.
Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Dr. Serdar Küni and Mr. Ismail Akbulut as well as
of all human rights defenders in Turkey;
ii.
Release Dr. Serdar Küni immediately
and unconditionally, as his detention is arbitrary since it only aims at
sanctioning his legitimate human rights activities;
iii. Put
an end to all forms of harassment, including at judicial level, against them, as well as all human rights defenders in Turkey;
iv.
Comply with all the provisions of the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights
Defenders, in particular with:
- its
Article 1, which provides that “everyone has the right, individually and in
association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and
realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and
international levels”;
- its
Article 6(a), which foresees that “everyone has the right, individually and in
association with others, to participate in peaceful activities against
violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms”;
- its
Article 9, which provides that “in the exercise of human rights and fundamental
freedoms, including the promotion and protection of human rights as referred to
in the present Declaration, […] everyone has the right, individually and in
association with others, inter alia: […] (c) to offer and provide
professionally qualified legal assistance or other relevant advice and
assistance in defending human rights and fundamental freedoms”.
- its
Article 11, which provides that “everyone has the right, individually and in
association with others, to the lawful exercise of his or her occupation or
profession”. 
- its
Article 12.2, which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures
to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually
and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de
facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action
as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in
the present Declaration”;
v. Ensure
in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in
accordance with international human rights standards and international
instruments ratified by Turkey.

[1]               Cizre has witnessed unprecedented destruction
following clashes which took place during a curfew lasting over 78 days, at the
beginning of 2016. In a statement, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid
Ra’ad Al Hussein urged in particular “the Turkish authorities to respect the
fundamental rights of civilians in its security operations and to promptly
investigate the alleged shooting of a group of unarmed people”. See: Turkey: Zeid
