This followed his return from Tunisia where he attended a conference on "Combating Corruption and its Impact on Democratic Transformation" organized by the Center for Support of Democratic Transformation and Human Rights (DAAM) on September 28, 2018. However, at the time of publication of this appeal, the travel ban has not been notified to Mr. Ali.  Mr. Khaled Ali fears that this decision might be related to a comment he posted on Facebook concerning the conference he attended in Tunisia. However, according to the media that reported the news, the travel ban would have been issued in the framework of case No. 173/2011 also known as the “NGO Foreign Funding case”, under which several other human rights defenders have been subjected to travel bans, asset freezes and arbitrary detention in the past years[2]. Judge Mr. Hichem Abdelmajid, who is responsible for the case, declared that he needed to review the casefiles in order to be able to confirm the information.  Mr. Khaled Ali was not aware of being involved in this case, to which he had previously participated only to provide legal support to other defendants.  The Observatory recalls that this is not the first case of judicial harassment against Mr. Khaled Ali, who, as he was running for presidency, was sentenced in September 2017 to three months in prison for “violating public decency” for celebrating a court victory concerning a decision of the Egyptian government to hand over control of two islands to Saudi Arabia.  In light of the current wave of crackdown against civil society in Egypt, with three human rights defenders arrested since May 11, 2018[3], the Observatory urges the Egyptian authorities to put an end to the widespread use of judicial harassment, travel bans and arbitrary detention against human rights defenders, and to ensure that their physical and psychological integrity, as well as their freedom of movement, is respected.  Actions requested: Please write to the authorities of Egypt asking them to: i.Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity Mr. Khaled Ali,and all human rights defenders in Egypt,; ii. Immediately and unconditionally lift the travel ban against Mr. Khaled Ali asit is merely aimed at punishing him for his human rights activities; iii. Put an end to all acts of harassment, including at the judicial level, against Mr. Khaled Ali, and all human rights defenders in Egypt, and ensure that they are able to carry out their activities without hindrance;  iv. Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially Articles 1, 6(c) and 12.2; and v. More generally, ensure in all circumstances the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with international and regional human rights instruments ratified by Egypt. Addresses: ·     President of the Arab Republic of Egypt, H.E.
