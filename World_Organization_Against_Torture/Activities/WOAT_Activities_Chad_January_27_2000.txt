Brief reminder of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT received information from the « Association pour les Victimes de la Repression en Exil, AVRE », member of the OMCT network, that Nasour Aware was arrested at his home in N’Djaména during the night of 26th December 1999 by agents of the GSP (Groupement de la Sécurité Présidentielle).  Since 26th December 1999, his whereabouts as well as the reason for his arrest was unknown.  There is reason to believe that his arrest and disappearance was linked to his connection as a friend and business collaborator of Bichara Digui who was executed in the middle of the street in N’Djaména in the summer of 1997.  New Information  According to the information received from AVRE, Nasour Aware was released on Sunday 23 January 2000.  Remarks  The International Secretariat of OMCT would like to thank all the members of the network and all other organisations and individuals for the action undertaken following our appeals.  Geneva, 26th January 2000
