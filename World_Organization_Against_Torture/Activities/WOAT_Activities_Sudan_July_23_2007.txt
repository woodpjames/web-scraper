Brief description of the situation: The Observatory has been informed by the Sudan Organisation Against Torture (SOAT) of the arbitrary arrest and enforced disappearance of Mr. Osman Ibrahim, spokesperson of the Committee against the Kajbar Dam, a group campaigning on behalf of the communities which are at risk of being affected by this dam. According to the information received, on July 20, 2007, Mr. Osman Ibrahim was arrested by police officers early in the morning while at his home in Farraig village, Halfa municipality (Northern Sudan), without a warrant and without being informed of where he was being taken. His arrest followed incidents reported on June 13, 2007, when Sudanese security forces killed and injured civilians in the Farraig village by shooting at them during a peaceful demonstration against the construction of the Kajbar dam in the area. On that occasion, several individuals were arrested and detained in Dongola, the capital of the northern State, and in Khartoum[1]. As of the time of issuing this urgent appeal, Mr. Ibrahim’s whereabouts remain unknown. The Observatory expresses its deep concern regarding the arbitrary arrest and enforced disappearance of Mr. Osman Ibrahim, which seems to be aimed at sanctioning his human rights activities, and urges the Government to take all necessary measures in order to guarantee his physical and psychological integrity. Action requested: Please write to the authorities in Sudan urging them to:  Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Osman Ibrahim; Take prompt action in order to locate Mr. Osman Ibrahim, make public his whereabouts, and ensure his immediate release; Put an end to all acts of harassment against all Sudanese human rights defenders; Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, and Article 12.2, which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”; More generally, ensure in all circumstances the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with international and regional human rights instruments ratified by Sudan.
