Judicial harassment
Cambodia
August 22, 2018
 
The Observatory for the Protection of
Human Rights Defenders, a partnership of FIDH and the World Organisation
Against Torture (OMCT), has received new information and requests your urgent
intervention in the following situation in Cambodia.
 
New information:
 
The Observatory has been
informed by reliable sources about the continued judicial harassment of Mr.
Yi Soksan, Senior Investigator, Mr. Nay Vanda,
Head of Administration, senior staff members of the Cambodian Human Rights and
Development Association (ADHOC) and Mr. Ny Chakrya,
former Head of ADHOC’s Human Rights and Monitoring Section and now Deputy
Secretary-General of the National Election Committee (NEC).
According to the
information received, on the morning of August 12, 2018, Mr. Nay Vanda received
a summons at his home issued by the Vice Prosecutor of the Phnom Penh Municipal
Court, Mr. Kuch Kim Long and dated August 9, 2018. On August 15 and 16, 2018,
respectively, Mr. Ny Chakrya and Mr. Yi Soksan also received the same summonses.
They have all been sued to attend a hearing at 7:30am on August 27, 2018 at the
Phnom Penh Municipal Court, in relation to trumped-up charges that were brought
against them in May 2016 and for which they have been arbitrarily detained for
more than one year between 2016 and 2017 (see background information)
 
The Observatory recalls
that, in addition to Messrs. Yi Soksan, Nay
Vanda, and Ny Chakrya, the charges, which
are still pending, include ADHOC Senior Investigator, Ms. Lim Mony, and ADHOC Head of Human Rights and Land Rights Section,
Mr. Ny Sokha (see background
information) All five human rights defenders face 5 to 10 years’ imprisonment,
if convicted.
 
The Observatory condemns in
the strongest terms the continued judicial harassment against Mr. Ny Sokha, Mr.
Yi Soksan, Mr. Nay Vanda, Ms. Lim Mony, and Mr. Ny Chakrya and urges the
Cambodian authorities to drop all charges against the five human rights
defenders, as they are only aimed at punishing them for their peaceful and
legitimate human rights activities. The Observatory also urges the authorities
to end all acts of harassment, including at the
judicial level, against all human rights defenders in the country.
 
Background information:
In March 2016, Ms. Khom
Chandaraty (aka Srey Mom) had requested the assistance of ADHOC in connection
with her interrogation by anti-terrorism police and a prosecutor about an
alleged affair with deputy opposition leader Mr. Kem Sokha. ADHOC responded to
Ms. Srey Mom’s request for legal and material assistance and provided a US$204
allowance to cover her food and transportation costs. This legitimate support,
aimed at covering the basic expenses of a client, was subsequently construed by
the Anti-Corruption Unit (ACU) as bribery and corruption.
On April 27 and 28, 2016,
Messrs. Ny Sokha, Yi Soksan, Nay Vanda, Ny Chakrya, and Ms. Lim Mony were
brought in for questioning by the ACU.  Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) official Mr.
Soen Sally, who was also summoned, did not appear before the ACU due to his
immunity as a UN staff member.
On May 2, 2016, Messrs.
Ny Sokha, Yi Soksan, Nay Vanda, and Ms. Lim Mony were charged with “bribery of
a witness” under Article 548 of the Criminal Code and detained. In addition,
Messrs. Ny Chakrya and Soen Sally were charged with being “accomplices to
bribery of a witness” under Articles 29 and 548 of the Criminal Code. Mr. Ny
Chakrya was also detained.
On June 13 and
September 28, 2016 respectively, the Court of Appeals in Phnom Penh and then
the Phnom Penh Municipal Court denied bail to the five defenders.
On October 27, 2016,
the Phnom Penh Municipal Court extended the detention of the five for up to
another six months under the pretext that the defendants needed to remain
available for any further interrogation and court procedures.
On November 11, 2016,
the five defenders were denied bail for the second time by the Court of
Appeals.
On November 21, 2016,
the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (WGAD) declared the detention of
Messrs. Ny Sokha, Yi Soksan, Nay Vanda, Ny Chakrya, and Ms. Lim Mony arbitrary.
The UNWGAD said their deprivation of liberty was in contravention of Articles
7, 9, 10, 11, and 20 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and
Articles 9, 10, 14, 22, and 26 of the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights (ICCPR), to which Cambodia is a State party. The UNWGAD called
on the Cambodian authorities to immediately release the five human rights
defenders and award them appropriate compensation.
On November 28, 2016,
the Court of Appeals upheld the extension of their pre-trial detention for
another six months and refused to close the investigation. The Court argued
that the issue of the extension of detention and the continuation of the
investigation were up to the discretion of the Investigating Judge of the Phnom
Penh Municipal Court.
On November 30, 2016,
the Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeals’ June 13, 2016 decision to refuse
to release the five on bail. The Court based its decision on Article 205 of the
Criminal Procedure Code, therefore upholding the continued applicability of
both detention grounds, i.e. to maintain public order and to prevent collusion
with accomplices, victims, and witnesses.
On February 27, 2017,
the Supreme Court decided to sever the appeal of Mr. Ny Chakrya from that of
the other four defenders. 
On March 13 and March
31, 2017 respectively, the Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeals’ November
28, 2016 decision to extend the pre-trial detention of Messrs. Ny Sokha, Yi
Soksan, Nay Vanda, and Ms. Lim Mony and of Mr. Ny Chakrya for up to another six
months.
On April 27, 2017, the
Phnom Penh Municipal Court’s Investigating Judge Theam Chanpiseth extended the
detention of Messrs. Ny Sokha, Yi Soksan, Nay Vanda, Ny Chakrya, and Ms. Lim
Mony for another six-month period.
 
On June 29, 2017,
Investigating Judge Theam Chanpiseth ordered the release on bail of Messrs. Ny
Sokha, Yi Soksan, Nay Vanda, Ms. Lim
Mony, and Mr. Ny Chakrya. Between 7pm and 8.30pm,
they were all released from Phnom Penh’s Prey Sar and Police Judiciaire
prisons, where they had been incarcerated for 427 days in pre-trial detention
on trumped-up charges. The decision came after the Judge closed the
investigation and sent the case to trial for a yet to be determined date.
