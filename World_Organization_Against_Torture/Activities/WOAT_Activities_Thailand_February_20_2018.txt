The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a partnership of FIDH
and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), has received new information
and requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in Thailand.
 
New
information:
 
The
Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the judicial harassment
of Mr. Sirawit Seritiwat, Ms. Nattha Mahatthana, Ms. Chonticha
Jaengrew, Mr. Rangsiman Rome, Mr. Karn Phongpraphan, Mr.
Sukrit Piansuwan, and human rights lawyer Mr. Anon Nampa for their
involvement in a peaceful demonstration held on February 10, 2018 in Bangkok. 
 
According
to the information received, on February 13, 2018, Colonel Burin
Thongprapai, acting on behalf of the military junta, the National Council for
Peace and Order (NCPO), filed a complaint at Bangkok’s Nang Lueng police
station against 50 participants, including the seven above-mentioned human
rights defenders, who took part in a demonstration held on February 10, 2018
near Bangkok’s Democracy Monument, which called for the NCPO to hold a general
election before the end of 2018.
 
The
50 individuals are accused of breaching Article 12 of NCPO Order 3/2015, which
bans political gatherings of more than four people. Mr. Sirawit Seritiwat,
Ms. Nattha Mahatthana,
Ms. Chonticha Jaengrew,
Mr. Rangsiman Rome,
Mr. Karn Phongpraphan,
Mr. Anon Nampa, and Mr. Sukrit Piansuwan are
also accused of “inciting unrest” under Article 116 of the Criminal Code
(‘sedition’).
 
The
violation of Article 116 is punishable with a prison term of up to seven years.
Article 12 of NCPO Order carries a penalty of up to six months in prison, or a
fine of up to 10,000 Baht (approximately 257 Euros), or both.
 
Five
of the seven human rights defenders - Ms. Nattha Mahatthana, Mr. Rangsiman Rome, Mr. Sirawit Seritiwat,
Mr. Anon Nampa, and Mr. Sukrit Piansuwan - already face charges for their
involvement in another pro-democracy protest on January 27, 2018 (see
background information).
 
The
Observatory recalls that the Thai authorities have a long record of judicial
harassment against Mr. Rangsiman Rome[1],
Mr. Sirawit Seritiwat[2], and Mr. Anon Nampa[3].

 
The
Observatory condemns the judicial harassment of Mr. Sirawit Seritiwat, Ms. Nattha Mahatthana, Ms.
Chonticha Jaengrew, Mr. Rangsiman Rome, Mr. Karn Phongpraphan, Mr. Anon Nampa,
and Mr. Sukrit Piansuwan, which seems to only aim at punishing
them for their peaceful and legitimate human rights activities, and expresses concern over what
seems to become a growing trend in Thailand against freedoms of peaceful
assembly and association.
 
Background information:
 
On January 30, 2018, Colonel Burin Thongprapai filed a
complaint at Bangkok’s Pathumwan police station against Mr. Sirawit Seritiwat, Ms. Nattha Mahatthana, Mr. Rangsiman Rome, Mr. Netiwit
Chotipatpaisal, Mr. Ekachai Hongkangwan, Mr. Anon Nampa, and Mr. Sukrit Piansuwan. They were accused of “inciting unrest” under Article 116 of the
Criminal Code (‘sedition’) and of breaching Article 12 of NCPO Order 3/2015.
 
On January 27, 2018, the seven activists
had led a peaceful protest of several hundred people on the Skywalk at Pathumwan
intersection in central Bangkok. The protesters were demonstrating against the
likely postponement of Thailand’s general election until 2019. NCPO Head
General Prayuth Chan-ocha had previously pledged to hold the polls in November
2018.
