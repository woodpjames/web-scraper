New information: The Observatory has been informed by the Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights (ZLHR) of the indictment and re-arrest of Ms. Jestina Mukoko, Executive Director of the Zimbabwe Peace Project (ZPP) and Board Member of the Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum[1], Mr. Broderick Takawira, ZPP Provincial Coordinator, and Mr. Andrisson Manyere, freelance journalist. Ms Mukoko and Mr. Takawira were finally released on bail. According to the information received, on May 4, 2009, Ms. Jestina Mukoko, Mr. Broderick Takawira, Mr. Andrisson Manyere and 12 political activists - members of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) - were served an indictment warrant for “terrorism and sabotage” charges by the Attorney General’s office and remanded in custody pursuant to Section 66.1 of the Criminal Procedure and Evidence Act, as they appeared in the Magistrates’ Court on routine remand. On May 4, 2009, Harare Magistrate Catherine Chimwanda granted the State leave to indict Ms. Mukoko, Mr. Takawira and Mr. Manyere as well as the 12 other co-accused, though defence counsel argued that the Magistrates’ Court could not revoke or suspend the bail granted to the accused in the beginning of 2009, since the bail came about as the result of political intervention and not as the result of any ruling by the court. Indeed, the bail had been granted till the trial as the result of instructions given to the Attorney General’s office by the president acting in consultation with members of the Joint Monitoring and Implementation Committee (JOMIC) pursuant to the Global Political Agreement. Additionally, the indictment was opposed on the basis that there was an appeal pending before the Constitutional Court, in which Ms. Mukoko and others allege a breach of their constitutional right to be afforded the full protection of the law. Magistrate Chimwanda then decided to adjourn the hearing and summoned several JOMIC members to testify on May 5, 2009. Finally, upon resumption of the hearing on May 5, 2009, Magistrate Chimwanda ruled she did not have the jurisdiction to consider the issue of bail continuing and committed all the detainees back to prison. Ms. Mukoko, Mr. Takawira and Mr. Manyere as well as the other 12 individuals were then formally indicted. Later, the Attorney General consented to bail and defence lawyers decided to go to court to have the agreement effected by the magistrate. On May 6, 2009, Magistrate Catherine Chimwanda granted some activists, including Ms. Jestina Mukoko and Mr. Takawira, bail of 600 USD under the same earlier conditions i.e. that they surrender their passports and report to police once a week. On May 7, 2009, the High court will examine Mr. Manyere’s request for bail. Ms. Mukoko’s trial is scheduled to take place on June 4, 2009. No information could be obtained regarding the date for Mr. Takawira’s trial. The Observatory expresses its deep concern about the continued harassment faced by Ms. Mukoko, Mr. Takawira and Mr. Manyere, and urges the Zimbabwe authorities to put their harassment to an end. Further, the Observatory requests the immediate release of Mr. Manyere. Background information On December 3, 2008, Ms. Mukoko was abducted by a group of 15 unidentified armed men from her home in Norton, and has allegedly undergone serious acts of torture. On December 8, 2008, Messrs. Broderick Takawira and Pascal Gonzo, ZPP driver, were also abducted by at least five men at the ZPP offices in Harare. Ms. Mukoko and Mr. Broderick’s whereabouts had remained unknown until December 24, 2008, when they first appeared before the Harare Magistrates Court, after weeks of incommunicado detention. On January 5 and 6, 2008, Ms. Mukoko, Mr. Gonzo and Mr. Takawira, accused by the Government of “recruiting or goading other people to undergo military training in neighbouring Botswana aimed at toppling Robert Mugabe’s Government”, appeared before the Harare Magistrates Court. The hearing in Ms. Mukoko and Mr. Takawira’s case was then postponed, pending a decision of the High Court on an application demanding further medical examination in a well-equipped hospital, as they reportedly bear signs of torture and ill-treatment. Throughout the first ten days of her detention, Ms. Mukoko was not allowed to take medication for an allergic condition she has, and has also learned with concern that she had been prescribed medication for anxiety and insomnia by an army doctor who facilitated acts of torture against her. Ms. Mukoko called for a toxicology report, fearing that the Zimbabwe Government might be trying to poison her. On February 6 and February 26, 2009 respectively, Mr. Pascal Gonzo and Mr. Broderick Takawira were release on bail by the High Court of Zimbabwe. On March 2, 2009, Ms. Jestina Mukoko was released on bail by the Harare Magistrates Court’s decision, on payment of 600 USD.
