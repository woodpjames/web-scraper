The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned by the situation of 1500 Sudanese refugees who, since 29th September 2005, have been living in front of the UNCHR offices in Cairo, protesting the fact that their request for resettlement was frozen following the signing of the recent peace accord between the Sudanese government and the South People’s Liberation Army (SPLA).  According to the information received, the police have repeatedly arrested and confiscated their identity papers given to them by the UNHCR, and they have also been subjected to violence. Furthermore, the refugees have been stigmatised by the press.  Egyptian police have set the deadline for evacuation before Eid, in the coming days.  OMCT calls on the Egyptian government and the UNHCR to find a solution to their situation and protect them from forced repatriation and further human rights abuses.
