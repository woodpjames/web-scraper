On the occasion of the forthcoming session, OMCT will draw the attention of the Commission to the following thematic issues: the right to reparation; impunity; human rights defenders; violence against women and children; and economic, social and cultural rights.   In this document, OMCT also urges the Commission to pay particular attention to the continuing effects of the "war against terror" on the respect for the prohibition against torture and ill-treatment. In recent months, the western media has published articles questioning the absolute nature of the prohibition of the use of torture. In light of this, OMCT calls upon the Commission to reaffirm the jus cogens status of the prohibition against torture in this year's resolution on torture.  Annexed to this position paper are two written statements - on the Democratic Republic of Congo and on Nigeria - that were submitted to the Commission.  We thank you in advance for the attention you will give the content of this position paper and remain at your disposal should you require any further information.
