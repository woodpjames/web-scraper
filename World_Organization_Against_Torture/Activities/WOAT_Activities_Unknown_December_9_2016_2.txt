December 9, 2016 - In marking International Human Rights
Defenders Day, the undersigned organizations commend the work of all human
rights defenders working for justice globally, stand in solidarity with them,
and highlight the case of individuals and organizations focused on Palestine.
Human rights defenders advocating and working on Palestinian human rights
around the world are facing intensifying threats and are increasingly targeted
for their work. 
 
Human rights defenders operating in Palestine use a variety
of non-violent methods to call attention to Israeli human rights violations and
to seek accountability. Each of these methods, however, is met with acts of
suppression and intimidation by Israel.[i]
Weekly peaceful protests throughout the West Bank are routinely met with force
by the Israeli military. Hashem Khader Abu Maria, 45, coordinator of
Defence for Children International – Palestine’s community mobilization unit,
was shot dead by Israeli forces while peacefully participating in a weekly
protest in July 2014. Human rights defenders seeking to monitor and document
human rights violations, including lawyers seeking to represent their clients,
have their freedom of movement and access obstructed, and are further at risk
of arrest and detention because of their work.[ii]
Palestinian human rights organizations providing submissions to the
International Criminal Court (ICC) during its preliminary examination have
faced even more extreme targeting. Palestinian organizations Al-Haq and
Al-Mezan have had staff members receive death threats, and have also been the
targets of a wider campaign that attempts to discredit and destabilize the
organizations.[iii]
These campaigns have included the hacking of emails, intimidating phone calls
to staff, and efforts to alarm donors; all of which seek to distract
organizations from their primary human rights work. While the ICC’s Office of
the Prosecutor and other authorities have recognized these threats,[iv]
acts of intimidation have persisted. 
 
Human rights defenders advocating on issues related to
Palestine in the United States and Europe are also facing intensifying pressure
for bringing attention to Israeli human rights violations.[v]
Israel has treated the Palestinian call to engage in nonviolent boycott,
divestment and sanctions (BDS) campaigns, given the absence of accountability
for Israel’s violations of international law, as a “strategic threat,” and has
countered it with increasingly coercive and punitive measures, both in
Palestine and globally.[vi]
In the United States, individuals and institutions engaged in advocacy for
Palestinian rights, including BDS campaigns, have been targeted[vii]
with online harassment,[viii]
surveillance, threats to their physical safety,[ix]
frivolous lawsuits,[x]
intimidation campaigns maligning them as terrorist supporters and antisemitic,[xi]
and even disciplinary and criminal investigations and sanctions for their
protest activities.[xii]
Legislative measures in the US aim to penalize advocacy for Palestinian rights
and engagement in BDS.[xiii]
 
These attacks in total aim to silence and undermine any
resistance to Israel’s unlawful policies and should not be viewed in isolation.
They should rather be examined within the broader context of impunity in Israel
itself, as well as the failure of states to hold Israel accountable for its
commission of internationally recognized crimes. 
 
Citizens and organizations have internationally and
domestically recognized rights[xiv]
to engage in alternative means for accountability and advocate for justice for
Palestinians.[xv]
Our organizations underscore the universality of human rights, including the
right to “participate in peaceful activities against violations of human
rights and fundamental freedoms,”[xvi]
and we call upon states to protect human rights defenders working on issues
related to Palestine.

[xv] Where states fail to search for and prosecute individuals
that have committed grave breaches of the Fourth Geneva Convention,
organizations have filled this gap by providing submissions to the
International Criminal Court. Where states have failed to ban the entry of
settlement products into their domestic markets, consumers have sought boycott
actions. Where states have given military aid to Israel without accountability,
individuals and groups have campaigned to circumscribe that aid.
