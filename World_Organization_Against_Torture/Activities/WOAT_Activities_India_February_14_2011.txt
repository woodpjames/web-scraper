Judicial harassment
India
February 14, 2011
The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in India.
Description of the situation:
The Observatory has been informed by Banglar Manabadhikar Suraksha Mancha (MASUM) about the judicial harassment against Mr. Julfikar Ali, a District Human Rights Monitor of MASUM in the Murshidabad District. 
According to the information received, the Murshidabad District Court heard today Mr. Julfikar Ali’s petition for anticipatory bail[1] for a case filed against him on February 16, 2008 (see footnote). At the hearing, the District & Sessions Judge allowed the anticipatory bail on condition of a bond of 5,000 Indian Rupees (about 82 euros). 
On February 11, 2011, the District Court granted another anticipatory bail to Mr. Ali with a bond of 3,000 Indian Rupees (about 49 euros) for another case filed against him on January 12, 2008. 
The two criminal cases filed against him had been registered early 2008 by senior officials of the Border Security Force (BSF) Officers at Raninagar Police Station. Mr. Julfikar Ali has been subjected to continuous acts of harassment, intimidation and persecution by the Border Security Force (BSF), as consequence of his reports describing acts of torture and firings by BSF.
On 2 January 2011, around 10 a.m., an unidentified policeman in plain clothes arrived at Mr. Julfikar Ali’s house and told his family members present in the house that an arrest warrant was pending against him, accusing him, among other things, of “rioting”, “unlawful assembly” and “attempt to murder”. His family continued to receive visits of policemen, asking for the whereabouts of Mr. Julfikar Ali. The visits reportedly increased considerably after Mr. Julfikar Ali’s met with the UN Special Rapporteur on human rights defenders, on 13 January 2011, during her country visit to India. Under pressure of the aforementioned visits of policemen, Mr. Ali surrendered himself to the District Court on February 11, 2011 with the petitions for the anticipatory bail that were granted on February 11 and then on February 14, regarding the two cases filed against him.
The Observatory condemns the judicial harassment against Mr. Julfikar Ali which seems to merely aim at sanctioning his human rights activities and urges the Indian authorities to guarantee in all circumstances his physical and psychological integrity and to put an immediate end to the judicial harassment against him by dismissing the charges that are still pending in the framework of the two criminal cases mentioned above. The Observatory recalls that cooperation of individuals and groups with the United Nations human rights mechanisms shall not be followed by any kind of reprisals[2].
Actions requested:

i.      Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Julfikar Ali, as well as of all human rights defenders in India;
