SYRIA: The authorities 
should put an immediate end to the smearing campaign against a human rights 
defender in exile Copenhagen-Geneva-Paris, 15 
April 2011 - The EMHRN and the Observatory for the protection of human rights 
defenders (a joint program of the International Federation for Human Rights - 
FIDH and the World Organisation Against Torture - OMCT) express their deep 
concern over the smearing campaign conducted by State-controlled media against a 
Syrian human rights defender. 
In April 2011, the private TV 
channel Aldunia, property of Syrian businessman Rami Makhlouf, a close 
relative of President Bashar Al-Asad[1], has repeatedly broadcasted a report 
stating that key figures of the pro-democracy opposition in exile have received 
financial support from the Israeli intelligence Mossad. 
The Aldunia 
report[2] notably accuses human rights defender 
Radwan Ziadeh, Director of the Damascus Center for Human Rights Studies 
(an EMHRN and FIDH member organisation) to have supposedly benefited from 
financial support from Israeli intelligence services (Mossad). The DCHRS is an 
independent human rights research center based in Damascus. Since its creation 
in 2005, it has been extensively advocating into international fora to shed 
light on Syria’s human rights records. 
In parallel, the EMHRN and 
the Observatory have been informed that Mr. Radwan Ziadeh, currently established 
in the USA, has received on several occasions explicit threats directed against 
his family still based in Syria, notably by e-mail. 

In the context of the 
unprecedented movement of protest that confronts the Syrian regime since 
mid-March 2011, the EMHRN and the Observatory express their deep concern as the 
authorities systematically use State controlled media to disseminate pro-regime 
propaganda and undermine the credibility of human rights defenders, 
pro-democracy activists and peaceful protesters, while restricting independent 
journalists’ access to areas where demonstrations have taken place. 

The EMHRN and the 
Observatory call upon the Syrian authorities: 

-          
to ensure that an end be put 
to all forms of harassment, intimidation, threats, against human rights defender 
Radwan Ziadeh and his relatives;
-          
to order immediate, thorough, 
effective and impartial investigations into the threats against Mr. Ziadeh's 
relatives, the result of which must be made public, in order to identify all 
those responsible, bring them before a civil competent and impartial tribunal 
and apply to them the penal sanctions provided by the 
law;
-          
to conform in all 
circumstances with international human rights standards and instruments ratified 
by Syria, and with the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, in 
particular its Articles 5 (a) and 6 as well as its Article 12.2, which provides 
that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by 
the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with 
others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse 
discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his 
or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present 
Declaration”.
