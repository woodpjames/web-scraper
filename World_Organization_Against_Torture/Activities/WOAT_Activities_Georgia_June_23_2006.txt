Brief description of the situation:The Observatory has been informed by the Human Rights Information and Documentation Centre (HRIDC) that the office of the Public Movement « Multinational Georgia » (PMMG), a non-profit NGO that notably aims at promoting national minorities’ rights and developing their integration in the Georgian society, was broken into and robbed on June 7, 2006.  According to the information received, early in the morning on June 7, 2006, the door of the NGO’s office was broken by unknown individuals who stole the hard disks of the computers, which contained many of the working documents of the organisation. In particular, the draft of an alternative report on the implementation of the Convention for the Protection of National Minorities, to be addressed to the United Nations and the Council of Europe, was stolen, as well as documentation and analytical materials describing situation of minorities in Georgia, which also included analyse of authorities’ policy on this item. However, all valuable equipments were left in the office.  During the two weeks before this break-in, several staff members of PMMG had been contacted by some representatives of the State in order to get various documents, especially the draft of the report that had to be addressed to the Council of Europe and the United Nations. As the PMMG members refused to provide them with this information, State representatives contacted PMMG partner organisations in the same purpose, which they also refused. These organisations were then told by the official representatives that “[they] will get it anyway”.  Besides, in March 2006, the car of Mr. Arnold Stepanian, Head of the organisation, was robbed before the organisation’s office, as well as the one of the press secretary. The two cars also contained many working documents.  During the last two years, PMMG established close cooperation with various minorities organisations and political groups. PMMG initiated the « Minority Assembly » that will take place in September 2006, where minority problems and the increasing of minority participation in the political processes will be discussed. Due to PMMG’s involvement in this issue and its critical positions vis-à-vis the governmental policies on minorities, several governmental non-governmental organisations (GONGOs) tried to ostracise the organisation.  The Observatory expresses its deep concern regarding those acts, which seem to only aim at intimidating human rights defenders in Georgia, in particular those who try to promote and defend minorities’ rights in this country. Actions requested: Please write to the authorities in Georgia urging them to: i.	guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of the members of the Public Movement “Multinational Georgia”, and all other human rights defenders in Georgia;  ii.	put an immediate end to any kind of harassment against the Public Movement “Multinational Georgia” and conduct a fair, impartial and independent inquiry into these events, in order to identify those responsible, bring them to justice and pronounce sentences proportional to the gravity of their crimes;  iii.	comply with the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, in particular article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, article 5c, which provides the right “to communicate with non-governmental or intergovernmental organisations”, and article 12.2, which declares that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually or in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”;  iv.	more generally, ensure in all circumstances the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights instruments ratified by Georgia.
