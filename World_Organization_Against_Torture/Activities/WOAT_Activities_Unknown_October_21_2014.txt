Nominations can be submitted electronically at  www.martinennalsaward.org
 
Deadline: 9 December 2014

The Award is granted annually to an individual, or exceptionally an
organisation, in recognition of their commitment and ongoing efforts in the
defence and promotion of human rights. Nominees must be currently involved in
work for the promotion and protection of human rights. Special account is taken
of those who are at risk and have demonstrated an active record of combating
human rights violations by courageous and innovative means. The MEA aims to
encourage individuals or organisations, particularly those who are working in
conditions hostile to fundamental human rights and who are in need of
protection.
 
The present value of the annual Award is 20'000 Swiss Francs, to be used for
further work in the field of human rights. The following organisations participate
in the Jury that selects the award: Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch,
Front Line Defenders, Human Rights First, International Federation for Human
Rights (FIDH), the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), International
Commission of Jurists (ICJ), International Service for Human Rights (ISHR), Protestant
Agency for Diakonia and Development (Germany) and HURIDOCS.
 
The Ceremony is hosted by the
City of Geneva in late 2015. They provide each of the final three nominees with
project
funds of 11’650 CHF and a 5’000 CHF travel grant. 
 
Martin Ennals (1927-1991) was
instrumental to the modern human rights movement. He creatively pursued ideas
ahead of his time and was the driving force behind other organisations. His
deep desire was to see more cooperation among NGOs.
