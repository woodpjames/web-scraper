Brief description of the facts:The Observatory has been informed by Human Rights in China (HRIC) that the Chinese dissident and human rights defender Mr. Zhao Changqing, detained in the Shaanxi Province’s Weinan Prison, has been repeatedly subjected to abusive treatments.  Mr. Zhao, who was already suffering from tuberculosis when he was arrested, has been imposed lengthy periods of solitary confinement during his detention. He recently spent 40 days in solitary confinement following his refusal to sing “Socialism is Good”, a song praising the Chinese Communist Party and the socialist system, during a ceremony at the prison.   On another occasion, Mr. Zhao was beaten by other inmates because he was engaged in conversation with another prisoner who was a Falun Gong practitioner. He was subsequently detained in solitary confinement, in spite of his injuries.  In November 2002, Mr. Zhao Changqing signed along with 191 dissidents from all over the country an “Open Letter to the 16th Party Congress”, calling, in particular, for political reforms, progress with regards to democratisation, the protection of humans right in the country, the right to return of exiled Chinese politicians, and the release of prisoners of conscience. On November 7, 2002, Mr. Zhao disappeared, but the police denied that he was in detention. An official notice of Mr. Zhao’s criminal detention was issued to his sister on November 27, 2002. One month later, Zhao was formally charged with “incitement to subvert State power”, and in August 2003, he was sentenced to five years in prison.  Background information:Mr. Zhao Changqing is currently undergoing his third term in custody for peacefully expressing his views on democracy and political reforms.  He was arrested for the first time on June 4, 1989, and spent four months in prison following his involvement in the pro-democracy movement.  In August 1997, he wrote an essay on political reforms and ran for election as representative to the People’s Congress but he was subjected to pressures to withdraw. He was secretly detained before the ballots could be cast on January 14, 1997, and was sentenced to three years of imprisonment in July 1998 for “incitement to subvert State power” because he had accused the local government of violating election laws.   Actions required:Please write to the Chinese authorities urging them to: i.	Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Zhao Changqing;  ii.	Release immediately Mr. Zhao Changqing and ensure that the charges against him be dropped as they are arbitrary;  iii.	Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, article 6(b), which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others (...) to publish, impart or disseminate to others views, information and knowledge on all human rights and fundamental freedoms”, and its article 8(2), which provides that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to submit to governmental bodies and agencies and organisations concerned with public affairs criticism and proposals for improving their functioning and to draw attention to any aspect of their work that may hinder or impede the promotion, protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms”;  iv.
