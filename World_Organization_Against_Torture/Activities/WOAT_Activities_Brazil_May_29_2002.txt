Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT has received information from Grupo Tortura Nunca Más / RJ (GTNM), on the impunity enjoyed by the perpetrators of the torture, threats and ill-treatment to which Mr. Carlos Abel Dutra García was subjected while in detention at the Superintendence of Federal Police of Rio de Janeiro, in Brasil.  According to the information received, in May 2002, the current Superintendent of  the Federal Police of Rio de Janeiro, officer Marcelo Nogueira Itagiba, ordered officer Roberto Jaureguiber Prel Júnior to investigate the attack that the Secretary of Citizenship and Human Rights in the State of Rio de Janeiro suffered on May 14th, 2002.  He also represents the Federal Police of RJ in an agreement known as the "Força Tarefa”, which federal and state governments envisage will combat violence in the state.  Roberto Jaureguiber Prel Júnior had been  accused of being responsible for the torture to which Mr.  Carlos Abel Dutra García was subjected, but on April 2001, he was allowed to return to his previous post.  The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned by the fact that a police officer who should be suspended from its public functions for violating human rights, namely officer Roberto Jaureguiber Prel Júnior, not only continues to enjoy impunity, but is responsibile for the protection of the security of citizens and institutions of the State of Rio de Janeiro.  OMCT is also concerned by the security and physical and psychological integrity of Mr.  Carlos Abel Dutra García and his family.  Background  According to the reports, on August 20th, 1996, Mr.  Carlos Abel Dutra García was arrested in the street and taken to the Superintendence of the Federal Police of Rio de Janeiro.  Mr.  Carlos Abel Dutra García was reportedly severely ill-treated and beaten by various officers both during his arrest and at the police station.  Mr.  Carlos Abel Dutra García was hit on the face and his head was banged against the walls, until he fell unconscious.  According to the report, when he lost consciousness, the officers pulled him up by the hair and beat him again for several minutes; while his mouth and nose bled, another policeman aimed his gun to his head saying “we are going to finish with him”.  He was tortured until about 2a.m., after which he was placed in a cell.  One hour later the police poured cold water on him in order to wake him up because his family had sent a lawyer who had requested to see him.  The lawyer was informed that Mr. Carlos Abel Dutra García was charged with “contempt for authority and aggression”, he was declared innocent of these charges on 1997.  According to the information received, Mr. Carlos Abel Dutra García was released on the night of August 21st, 1996, following which he underwent a medical exam performed by Medicina Legal, who established that the he had been assaulted while in detention.  Mr. Carlos Abel Dutra García then filed a complaint for abuse of authority and aggression; At the time there was no adequate legislation against torture, therefore it was not possible to file a complaint of torture.  However his case was taken again on August 2000 by the Special Rapporteur on Torture of the United Nations as one of those “cases that served as examples of the existence of torture.”    According to the report, since a criminal complaint was filed against 7 members of the police: Roberto Jaureguiber Prel Júnior - Federal Police officer; Luiz Amado Machado - Federal Police officer;  Sérgio Vinicius de Oliveira - Federal Police officer; Anísio Pereira dos Santos – officer; Carlos Pereira Silva - delegate;  Luiz Oswaldo Vargas de Aguiar–judicial secretary of the Federal Police,  and Carlos Alberto Emiliano da Silva – Operational assistant of Diverse Services, the case was pursued by the court, but because of bureaucratic obstructions the case was filed after two out of the seven perpetrators were granted “habeas corpus”.  Roberto Jaureguiber Prel Júnior was suspended from work when the complaints were made public.  According to the report, during this time, Mr.  Carlos Abel Dutra García was repeatedly sent death threats and harassed, so that he was forced to leave his home to protect his family.  Not only did he continue to receive threats, but he was also fired from his job in Petrobás / FRONAPE, after taking several days off for health related problems, since because of his work he had suffered four back hernias.
