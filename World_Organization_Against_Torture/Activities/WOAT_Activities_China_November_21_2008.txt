Brief description of the situation The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by a reliable source and Antenna International, a member organisation of OMCT SOS-Torture Network, about the imminent execution of Mr. Wo Weinhan, who has been sentenced to death in 2006 for spying, following a reportedly unfair trial. According to the information received, on 19 January 2005, Mr. Wo Weihan, a Chinese citizen and a scientist, was arrested on suspicion of spying. The government said Mr. Wo confessed to passing military secrets to Taiwan. Mr. Wo was also charged with joining a pro-Taiwan political group under an alias while in Germany in 1989. After a brief period of house arrest, while Mr. Wo recovered from a stroke suffered during his detention, he was again arrested on 30 March 2005. On 27 May 2007, Mr. Wo was sentenced to death by the Beijing No.2 Intermediate People’s Court on charges related to military espionage and endangering state security. On 24 March 2008, the Beijing Higher People’s Court, in a closed session, confirmed the conviction and death sentence. Mr. Wo’s sentence has then been subjected to final review by the Supreme People’s Court, which seemed to have ended, as on 18 November 2008, the High Court of Beijing contacted Ms. Wo’s wife with instructions that she should submit a request for visitation within seven days. This is apparently a standard procedure before executions that typically take place within seven days after the Supreme Court has concluded its review. According to the same information received, during the first ten months of interrogation, Mr. Wo had no access to legal counsel. Mr. Wo reportedly only saw a lawyer one year after he was taken into custody, after the Minister of State Security had completed its investigation and determined his guilt. He reportedly confessed but later retracted during trial. According to the information received, Mr. Wo confessed under force, while fearing for his life. However, the Court has reportedly used the initial confession as its main evidence for his conviction and death sentencing. Furthermore, his family has had reportedly no visitation rights during the entire three years of imprisonment. China’s laws on state secrets make access to information about such cases extremely difficult for families, legal representatives, and advocacy groups. The International Secretariat of OMCT expresses its serious concern with regard to the death sentence and the imminent execution of Mr. Wo Weihan. OMCT wishes to recall that it is strongly opposed to the death penalty as an extreme form or cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment and a violation of the right to life as proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international human rights instruments. OMCT is all the more concerned following the report that Mr. Wo’s confession was obtained by force and that his procedural rights were not guaranteed. OMCT wishes to express its concern over the use of statements obtained under torture as evidence in a court case. OMCT recalls that China is a State party to the UN Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment which prohibit cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. Actions Requested Please write to the authorities in the People’s Republic of China urging them to:   Guarantee, in all circumstances, the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Wo Weinhan;  Immediately stop the execution of Mr. Wo Weinhan;  Conduct an immediate review of the case and, if charges are well-founded, to conduct a re-trial before an impartial, independent, competent and fair tribunal and guarantee his procedural rights at all times;  Guarantee that no evidence obtained under torture be used in the court case as stipulated in Article 15 of the UN Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment;  Order a thorough and impartial investigation into these events in order to identify all those responsible, bring them to trial and apply the penal and/or administrative sanctions as provided by law;  Guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
