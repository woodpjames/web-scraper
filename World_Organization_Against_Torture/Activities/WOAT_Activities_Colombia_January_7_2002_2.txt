Brief description of the situation:  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by a reliable source about the torture and ill-treatment to which five youths have reportedly been subjected. The youths in question are: Oveimar Vega González ; Edgar Amado Flórez ;  Sergio N. ;  Heidi Vega González,  and a child under the age of 18, whose identity and whereabouts are for the moment unknown, by agents from the Departamento Administrativo de Seguridad  (DAS) in Popayán, Departamento del Cauca.  According to the information received from the Colectivo de Abogados « José Alvear Restrepo », there is serious concern about the youths’ present situation, having been arrested by DAS agents on November 30th 2001 in the central urban area of Popayán, and who are being accused of belonging to a guerrilla group.  According to the information received, the youths’ families reported that they have been subjected to torture by the DAS agents and that their health is being put at risk due to ill-treatment and torture. Our sources indicate that Heidi Vega González  and Oveimar Vega González suffered from haemorrhages during several days as a consequence of the blows that they received. Their families have reportedly asked the DAS for permission for them to receive medical visits. The reports added that one of the captured youths has been submitted to electric shocks, which have affected his sense of sight.    According to the information received, one month after these events the youths are still being detained under strict security in the DAS’ facilities, without having been transferred to a  detention centre.   The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned about the continuous violations of human rights in Colombia and condemns these new acts of extreme violence, the persecution of civilians, the apparent impunity of the perpetrators and the lack of effective measures of protection provided by the national authorities to prevent such acts.  Furthermore, OMCT recalls that torture is classified under Colombian law an offense, which must be punished by penal sanction by the state.  Action requested:  Please write to the authorities in Colombia urging them to:  i.	take all necessary measures to locate the  whereabouts of the youth detained by the DAS members  on 30 November 2001 in Popayán and guarantee his physical and psychological integrity, as well as that of Oveimar Vega González ; Edgar Amado Flórez ;  Sergio N.;  Heidi Vega González; ii.	order the above mentioned 5 youths’ immediate release in the absence of valid charges, or if such charges exist, bring him before an impartial and competent tribunal and guarantee their procedural rights at all times;   iii.	order an immediate, thorough and impartial investigation into the above-mentioned cases, in particular  the allegations of torture and ill-treatment inflicted upon the youths, in order to identify those responsible, bring them to trial and apply the penal, civil and or administrative sanctions as provided by law;  iv.	comply immediately with recommendations issued by international and regional human rights bodies, including the Bureau of the High Commission for Human Rights, the Human Rights Commission of the UNO and the Interamerican Commission for Human Rights, as well as non-governmental human rights organisations;  v.	guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards, in particular the Convention Against Torture ratified by Colombia.
