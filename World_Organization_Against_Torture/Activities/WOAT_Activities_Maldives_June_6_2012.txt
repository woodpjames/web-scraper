URGENT APPEAL -
THE OBSERVATORY

 
MDV 001 / 0612 / OBS 053
Assault
Maldives
June 6, 2012
 
 
The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of
the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation
Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent intervention in the following
situation in the Maldives.
 
Description
of the situation:
 
The
Observatory has been informed by reliable sources of a violent assault against
Mr. Ismail ‘Hilath’ Rasheed, prominent Maldivian blogger and journalist advocating in favour of
freedom of religion and combating extremism, and former editor of the newspaper
Haveeru.
 
According
to the information received, on June 4, 2012, Mr. Rasheed was stabbed in the
neck at around 8:15 p.m. close to his house in Male'. He was later brought to
the ADK hospital to undergo emergency treatment.
 
The
police subsequently cordoned off the area around the location of the attack and
an investigation was opened. However, as of issuing this urgent appeal, no
information could be obtained regarding the perpetrators and the motivation of
the attack. On June 5, 2012 in the morning, Mr. Rasheed’s condition had
reportedly stabilised, but was still critical. He was due to remain in
intensive care for a couple of days.
 
Two
blogs belonging to Mr. Rasheed were blocked in November 2011 by the
Communications Authority of the Maldives (CAM) upon order of the Ministry of
Islamic Affairs, on the grounds that the sites contained “anti-Islamic”
material. Mr. Rasheed claimed then he was being censored, in particular,
because of his calls for more freedom of interpretation within the faith. He
had also called to amend the clause in the constitution which requires all
Maldivians to be Sunni Muslims only.
 
On
December 10, 2011, Mr. Rasheed had already been attacked by a group of men
while attending a protest calling for religious tolerance on the occasion of
Human Rights Day. He had subsequently been arrested by police and questioned
over his involvement in the protest gathering, before being jailed for over
three weeks for “disrupting the religious unity of the Maldives”. His case was
dismissed, but he was later told by the authorities that he had been detained
for “his own safety”.
 
Actions requested:
 
Please write to the Maldivian authorities and ask them
to:
 
i.      Order an immediate, thorough and transparent investigation into the
assault against Mr. Ismail ‘Hilath’ Rasheed with a view to establishing the
truth and to sanctioning all those responsible for this attack;
 
ii.     Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity
of all human rights defenders in the Maldives;
 
ii.  Put
an end to acts of harassment
against all human rights defenders in the Maldives;
 
iii.  Conform in any circumstances with the
provisions of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted on December 9,
1998 by the United Nations General Assembly, and in particular:
-      
Article
1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually or in association
with others, to promote the protection and realization of human rights and
fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, 
-    
 and Article 12.2 which provides that “the State
shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent
authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse
discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his
or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present
Declaration”.
 
iv. Ensure in all circumstances
respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with
international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by
the Maldives.
