Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Palestinian Society for the Protection for Human Rights and the Environment (LAW), a member of the OMCT network, of the killing of three persons and hundreds injured in various incidents and clashes between Palestinian demonstrators and Israeli occupying forces in recent days.  According to LAW, on 13th May 2000, clashes between Palestinian demonstrators and Israeli occupying forces resulted in the death of Ahmad Shreim from Qalqilya.  Clashes also took place in the Meggido prison and an estimated 100 prisoners were injured when Israeli soldiers stormed the prison and released gas canisters and sound bombs.  It is also reported that on 15th May 2000, Adel Asafadi, 19, from Orif village in the district of Nablus, died after being shot in the neck by Israeli soldiers who were firing live ammunition to dispel a crowd of demonstrators at the Palestinian checkpoint south of Nablus. The victim died on the way to hospital.  Bashar Shantir, 18, from Askar Refugee Camp, was also shot in the vicinity of Joseph's tomb in Nablus.  Ahmad Odeh, 20, from Deir Al Hatab near Nablus, a member of the National Forces, was shot dead in the Al Bireh vicinity.   According to LAW, also on 15th May 2000, it is reported that 646 Palestinians were injured in clashes with the Israeli occupying forces, many whilst marching and holding peaceful assemblies held in most Palestinian towns and cities in commemoration of the 51st anniversary of the Nakba.  Most injuries were incurred on the victims' chest, abdomen and neck. Those with serious injuries have been transferred to the Jerusalem hospitals that are believed to be better equipped.         LAW notes that while peaceful marches in solidarity with the Palestinian prisoners have been taking place in most Palestinian cities since 10 May 2000, the Israeli occupation army has escalated its oppressive measures, using excessive force, rubber bullets, gas canisters and sound bombs to disperse the unarmed Palestinian protesters.  It is estimated that 862 Palestinians have been injured in the period 10-14 May 2000.  OMCT strongly condemns the excessive use of force by Israeli forces at peaceful demonstrations held by Palestinians in solidarity with Palestinian prisoners inside Israeli jails.  Action requested  Please write to the authorities in Israel urging them to:  take all necessary measures to guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of the above-mentioned persons and intervene with the appropriate authorities in order to secure that the adequate medical assistance is provided to all those injured in the clashes; put an end to the use of excessive force by the Israeli armed forces and guarantee an immediate investigation into the deaths of Ahmad Shreim, Bashar Shantir, Ahmad Odeh and Adel Asafadi, and the injuries of the above-mentioned incidents, identify those responsible, bring them before a civil competent and impartial tribunal and apply the penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions provided by law; guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
