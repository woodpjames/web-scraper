Description of the situation : The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the arbitrary arrest of Mr. Jean Rassoul, a member of the Committee of the Cereal Trade Union Branch in Tal Ziwan and famous for his commitment in favour of the defence of his fellow workmates in the Qamishli governorate, north east of Syria. According to the information received, on February 26, 2008, a State security patrol arrested Mr. Rassoul on his way to work. Witnesses reported that Mr. Rassoul was arrested without warrant, and taken to an unknown place. As of issuing this urgent appeal, no information had been made available as to his place of detention. The Observatory expresses its deepest concern about the arrest and subsequent enforced disappearance of Mr. Rassoul, and fears that it might be directly linked to the claims he made during the last cereal trade union conference, where he demanded that workers be granted more extensive milk and eggs quotas. The Observatory also fears for Mr. Rassoul’s physical and psychological integrity as an increasing number of human rights defenders have been subjected to torture or ill-treatments by the authorities over the past years. Actions requested: Please write to the Syrian authorities, urging them to:   Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Rassoul;  Locate Mr. Rassoul and order his immediate and unconditional release since his detention is arbitrary as it only aims at sanctioning his human rights activities;  Put an end to the harassment against all human rights defenders in the Syrian Arab Republic;  Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, and Article 12.2, which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”;  Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by the Syrian Arab Republic.
