The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in Uzbekistan.
Description of the situation:
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the violent aggression of Mr. Dmitry Tikhonov, member of the Human Rights Alliance of Uzbekistan. Mr. Dmitry Tikhonov has been monitoring trials, providing legal assistance to the victims of human rights violations committed in the town of Angren in the Tashkent region and circulating news about such violations (i.e. arbitrariness of the police, attempts on the lives of people who lodged complaints about the conduct of officials) through the Human Rights Alliance website.
According to the information received, on February 23, 2010, at around 8 p.m., Mr. Dmitry Tikhonov was violently attacked in his garage in Angren by two unidentified men. One of them, asked - while strangling him - : “Why do you write on the Internet all the time”? As Mr. Tikhonov tried to escape, he was hit on the head with an iron rod and lost consciousness. Although he was diagnosed with a serious concussion, he refused to be admitted to an hospital, fearing other attacks. On February 28, police officers carried out an inspection in Mr. Tikhonov's garage, and on March 1, Mr. Tikhonov underwent a medical examination.
The Observatory condemns the physical assault against Mr. Tikhonov, which took place in a context where human rights defenders are repeatedly targeted and threatened, especially since the last parliamentary elections in December 2009, and urges the Uzbek authorities to carry through an immediate, thorough, impartial and transparent investigation into the above-mentioned facts, in order to identify those responsible and bring them in the shortest delays before a competent and impartial tribunal. The Observatory recalls that two Uzbek human rights defenders, Messrs. Bakhtior Khamraev and Mamir Azimov, were similarly assaulted in November 2009[1].
The Observatory is also concerned with Mr. Tikhonov's health, considering the serious injuries he suffered as a result of the assault, and urges the Uzbek authorities to provide him medical care and guarantee him physical protection.
The Observatory recalls more generally that as a participating State of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the Observatory recalls that Uzbekistan recognises “the need for particular attention, support and protection for human rights defenders by the OSCE, its Institutions and field operations, as well as by participating States”.
Actions requested:
Please write to the authorities in Uzbek authorities, urging them to:

 Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Dmitry Tikhonov as well as all human rights defenders in Uzbekistan;
 Order an immediate, thorough, effective and impartial investigation into the above-mentioned attack, the result of which must be made public, in order to identify those responsible, bring them before a competent and impartial tribunal and apply to them the sanctions provided by the law;
 Put an end to all acts of harassment against Mr. Dmitry Tikhonov as well as all human rights defenders in Uzbekistan;
 Conform with the provisions of the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels” and its Article 12.2, which states that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”;
 Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by Uzbekistan.
