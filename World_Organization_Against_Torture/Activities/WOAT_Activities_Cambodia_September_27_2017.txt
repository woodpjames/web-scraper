Interactive Dialogue with the Special Rapporteur on Cambodia27
September 2017Thank
you Mr. President,Professor Smith, we address you today amid a rapidly
deteriorating attack on Cambodian democracy. OMCT believes that Cambodia could
not possibly hold free and fair elections in 2018, if the current situation
persists.We
are deeply concerned by the ruling party’s ongoing false narrative of a ‘color
revolution’ that  paints the political opposition, civil society
and independent voices as would-be revolutionaries, and is used to justify the militarization
of public life.Of major concern to OMCT is also the near-elimination of
the main opposition party through politically-motivated treason
charges against opposition leader Kem Sokha, who has
been detained since 3rd September, as well as two rounds
of controversial amendments to the Law on Political Parties.We
are also disturbed by the drastic escalation of physical
and legal threats against leaders and key organizations of Cambodia’s once-vibrant
civil society. Examples include the recent arbitrary detention and charging of
two young environmental activists Doem
Kundy and Hun Vannak from NGO Mother Nature; the
arbitrary detention for 427 days and charging of 4 staffers
of NGO ADHOC and the Deputy Secretary General of the National Election
Committee;  and the continuing
imprisonment and charging of prominent land activist Tep
Vanny.The crackdown against civil society has also included the
discriminatory enforcement of the controversial and unconstitutional NGO Law
and Trade Union Law. More recently, the targeted enforcement of Cambodia’s tax
system to
silence critical voices has led to the enforced closure
of the independent newspaper “The Cambodia Daily”
which, paired with the near-total shutdown of independent radio broadcasts, represent
a major blow to democracy, which requires a pluralistic and vibrant media.Mr. President, Professor Smith, we believe that it is
not too late to halt and reverse current trends, in order to secure what is
left of Cambodia’s civic space. We call upon the international community to
take a principled and vocal stand against Cambodia's rapid descent into
outright authoritarianism. With critical voices silenced, the Cambodian people
need your steadfast support more than ever.Thank
you.
