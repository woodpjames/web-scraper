Description of the facts: The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources of death threats against Mr. Kucaca Phulu, a lawyer and chairperson of the Zimbabwe Human Rights Association (ZimRights). According to the information received, on August 22, 2007, a person calling himself Moyo from the office of the Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front (ZANU PF, ruling party) called Mr. Kucaca Phulu’s office and spoke to the receptionist. This person said that Mr. Phulu had been seen with one of his client who is charged for “armed robbery” and wanted for arrest. He then threatened Mr. Phulu with harm for representing him and said that if his client could not be found, Mr. Phulu would be “killed” in his place.  The Observatory is deeply concerned by those threats which illustrate the situation of extreme insecurity faced by lawyers and human rights defenders in Zimbabwe. These facts, which occur in the context of organised and systematic violence against human rights defenders and political opponents, are a violation of the provisions of the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, which states in its article 11 that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to the lawful exercise of his or her occupation or profession”. The Observatory finally draws the attention of the Zimbabwean authorities to paragraph 17 of the Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers adopted by the UN Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders in 1990, which state that “where the security of lawyers is threatened as a result of discharging their functions, they shall be adequately safeguarded by the authorities”. Actions requested: Please write to the Zimbabwean authorities urging them to:  Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Kucaca Phulu and put an immediate end to any kind of threats or reprisals against him; Order a thorough and impartial investigation into the above-mentioned events, in order to identify all those responsible, bring them before a civil competent and impartial tribunal and apply to them the penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions provided by the law; Put an end to any kind of act of harassment and threats against all human rights defenders in the country; Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 9, 1998, especially its article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, article 11 above-mentioned and article 12.2, which states that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”; Conform with the provisions of the Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers adopted by the UN Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders in 1990; Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by Zimbabwe.
