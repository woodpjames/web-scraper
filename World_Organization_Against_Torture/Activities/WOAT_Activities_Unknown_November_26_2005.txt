This committee is composed of UN agencies (UNICEF, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, UN Office on Drugs and Crime, UN Development Programme) and NGOs (Casa Alianza, Penal Reform International, Save the Children UK, Defence for Children International, Terre des Hommes and OMCT) and is called Inter-Agency Panel on Juvenile Justice. The work of the Panel has also been concretised by the writing of a handbook entitled “Protecting the Rights of Children in Conflict with the Law – Programme and Advocacy Experiences from Member Organisations of the Inter-Agency Coordination Panel on Juvenile Justice”. OMCT has coordinated the translation and printing tasks. The Handbook has been presented during the April 2005 Bangkok Crime Congress and is available in four languages: English, French, Spanish and Arabic.
