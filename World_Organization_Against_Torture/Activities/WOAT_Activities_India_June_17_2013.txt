The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint
programme of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and the
International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), requests your urgent
intervention in the following situation in India.
 
Brief description of the situation:
 
The Observatory has been informed by Banglar Manabadhikar Suraksha Mancha
(MASUM) about the arbitrary arrest and judicial
harassment of 13 women human rights defenders, all members of Maitree, a
Kolkata based women’s network, in West Bengal.
 
According to the
information received, on June 13, 2013, at around 8.30 a.m., Ms. Anuradha Kapoor, Ms. Swapna, Ms. Kakoli Bhattacharya, Ms. Anchita
Ghatak, Ms. Shyamali Das, Ms. Ratnaboli Roy, Ms. Sharmistha Dutta Gupta, Ms. Shreya
Sanghari, Ms. Madhura Chakroborty,
Ms. Shreya Chakroborty, Ms. Sudeshna Basu, Ms. Aditi Basu and another member of Maitree, assembled before the
residence of the Chief Minister of the Government
of West Bengal, Ms. Mamata Bannerjee, bearing a few placards in their
hands and telling the police personnel guarding the residence of the Chief
Minister that they wished to submit memoranda on recent incidents of gang rapes
on two students at Barasat and Krishnaganj, Nadia, in West Bengal[1].
The activists were all arrested by the posted police authority without being
provided with arrest memos, and whisked to Lalbazar (the headquarters of Kolata
police force) Central Lock Up. They were later informed that they were arrested
for violating Section 151 of the Criminal Procedure Code (“arrest to prevent
the commission of cognizable offences”).
 
When MASUM
contacted the Lalbazar Central Lock Up at around 11.30
a.m. and asked for information on the arrestees, the attending
police officer only said that “yes there (were) few women activists inside the
lock up but other relevant information (was) with Kalighat police station”.
MASUM then contacted the Kalighat police station and the assistant
sub-inspector who was the duty officer at that time said that only the
Officer in Charge could throw light on the arrest and subsequent detention, but
he had gone to Arambagh and would be back only after an hour. At about 4.30
p.m., all 13 defenders were released on bond from Lalbazar. Charges against
them remain pending and they will all have to appear before the Magistrate
Court. During their detention, they did not have access to a lawyer, although
lawyers were present and try to see them from 10 a.m. until their release.
 
The Observatory condemns the arbitrary arrest and judicial harassment
against the 13 above-mentioned members of Maitree, which seems to merely aim at
sanctioning their peaceful women’s rights activities. 
 
Actions requested:
