Protests against this project have already resulted in loss of life and injury. OMCT has contacted all parties involved, including the Government of Bangladesh, private financial institutions and the Asian Development Bank, to express its deep concern at the risk of further violence associated with the project. OMCT has insisted that a decision on the future of the Phulbari mine should only be taken once a thorough, transparent and independent investigation into its human and environmental impact has been carried out, with the full and informed participation of all local communities.
