Four have been subjected to long detention periods under the emergency law declared in some states. At least two of them have been detained more than once since December 2018. Several detainees were moved to places of detention outside their original states thus hindering access to family visits, lawyers and health care. Isolation, combined with the well-documented use by the NISS of torture and other forms of ill-treatment against detainees, particularly whilst held in unknown locations, gives rise to serious concerns for their safety.  These arrests are mostly based on the Emergency legal framework and on the National Security Act 2010. The former allows for preventive arrest and detention on the basis of vague grounds without time limits to the detention or judicial oversight, therefore authorizing prolonged if not indefinite detention. The latter allows NISS officials to detain a suspect for up to four and a half months without charge in absence of any form of judicial scrutiny.[1] Eleven of the human rights defenders currently targeted are lawyers. For example, on December 21, 2018, and December 31, 2018, two human rights lawyers were arrested while providing legal aid services to detained protesters and students at Khartoum North court and Northern police station in Khartoum, and remain under incommunicado detention at the political section of NISS in Khartoum. As elaborated in the joint Observatory and ACJPS report “Target one to silence a hundred: the repression of human rights lawyers in Sudan”, the continued arrest and detention of human rights defenders has hindered access to legal aid services for thousands of protesters who remain in detention with or without charge. The Observatory and ACJPS urge the Government of Sudan to cease the repression of human rights defenders and allow them to exercise their rights to freedom of expression, association and assembly, as guaranteed under Sudan’s Constitution and international standards ratified by Sudan. The authorities must guarantee in all circumstances that human rights defenders are able to carry out their legitimate activities without fear of reprisals and free from any restrictions, including judicial harassment. The Observatory and ACJPS recall that, during the crackdown, the Sudanese authorities, including the NISS and the Anti-Riot Police as well as private militias in civilian clothes, have responded by indiscriminately firing live ammunition and tear gas into crowds of peaceful protesters, killing civilians. Witnesses have reported that snipers have targeted demonstrators in the head and chest. At least 40 protesters have been reported dead while hundreds have been arrested.  The Observatory and ACJPS further recall that in 2018 another social protest movement was also met by violent repression[2]. Annex: List of human rights defenders arrested between December 2018 and February 2019 Mr. Adam Mahdi, chief editor of Darfur 24 online newspaper, was arrested on January 27, 2019 subjected to three-month imprisonment under Emergency law of 2007 in Nyala of South Darfur.Mr. Ahmed Yassien was arrested on January 3, 2019 in Port Sudan while still nursing an injury from a tear gas canister that hit him.
