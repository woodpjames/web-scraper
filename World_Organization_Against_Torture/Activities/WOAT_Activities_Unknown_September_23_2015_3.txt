Mr President, 
In his seventh annual report to the Council
on alleged cases of reprisals and intimidation, the Secretary General shares
that the types of acts reported ‘seem to have become more varied and severe’
and target ‘not only individuals or groups concerned but also their families,
legal representatives NGOs and anyone linked to them’.
It is clear from the report that reprisals
constitute a systematic and deliberate strategy to deter civil society
engagement with human rights bodies. While the UN’s response remains
inadequate, impunity reigns and sustains this disturbing status quo.
The
report evidences the consistent failure by States to respond to requests for
information on allegations. The number of cases cited that continue without
investigation by States shows a remarkable lack of concern and contempt for the
Council by States in question. 
Perhaps most disturbingly, the SG documents
several cases of reprisals and intimidation by Member States of this Council —
Members who are meant to ‘uphold the highest standard in the promotion and
protection of human rights’ and ‘fully cooperate with the Council’. 
Beyond the abject failure of China,
Kazakhstan, Maldives, Russia, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates,
Venezuela, and Viet Nam, among others, to meet these membership standards, the
Human Rights Council is failing to carry out its own institutional mandate,
which obliges it to promote the full implementation of States’ human rights
obligations and to review States’ compliance with such obligations. 
To discharge this obligation, including the
obligation to prevent reprisals against individuals who cooperate with UN human
rights mechanisms, the Council should:
(1)  
Heed the Secretary-General’s
recommendation that the Council “devote sufficient time to the discussion of
the present report” by scheduling a stand-alone interactive dialogue;
(2)  
Seek information concerning
action taken by States cited in the report to prevent and ensure accountability
for reprisals, assess that State’s
compliance with its international human rights obligations and call on that
State to take further action where it falls short of meeting those obligations;
and 
(3)  
ensure that States mentioned in
the SG’s report inform the Council regularly and in a timely manner of steps
taken to investigate cases of reprisals, prosecute perpetrators, and provide
remedies to victims.
Mr President, we welcome the steps taken by
you and your Bureau to better address reprisals, as positively noted by the SG,
and urge your successor to build on this practice. For their part, however, Member
States of this Council must confront the reality that by failing to take
adequate or concrete steps to prevent, condemn, investigate, ensure
accountability, and end impunity for reprisals, they are complicit in
undermining the system they have created to promote and protect human rights.
