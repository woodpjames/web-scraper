			The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a 
partnership of FIDH and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), has 
received new information and requests your urgent intervention in the 
following situation in Sudan.

			 

New information:

				 

				The Observatory has been informed by the African Center for Justice and 
Peace Studies (ACJPS)about the release of Mr. Osman Salih, 
lawyer, Mr. Salih Mahmoud Osman, Vice-Chairperson of the 
Darfur Bar Association and Mr. Amjed Fareed, blogger and 
human rights defender.

				 

				According to the information received, on April 10, 2018, Mr. Osman 
Salih, Mr.Salih Mahmoud Osman, and Mr. Amjed Fareed were released from 
prison.

				 

				Mr. Osman Salih, Mr.Salih Mahmoud Osman and Mr. Amjed Fareed had been 
arrested by the National Intelligence Security Service (NISS) respectively 
on January 10, February 1 and January 18, 2018 and further detained without 
charges (see background information below).

				 

					The Observatory recalls that these arrests and detentions occurred in 
reaction to nation-wide demonstrations that began on January 6, 2018 and 
were set off by the announcement of Sudan’s 2018 budget and the 
lifting of subsidies and measures, effectively tripling Sudan’s U.S. 
dollar exchange rate and increasing the price of basic commodities. Sudanese 
authorities have carried out a campaign of massive arbitrary arrests and 
detentions, including political party leaders, journalists, students, human 
rights defenders and other individuals for their involvement in the 
protests[1]. The police and 
the NISS have used excessive force to disperse and arrest protesters, 
including the reported use of tear gas and beatings with sticks and water 
hose pipes[2].

					 


						The Observatory welcomes the release of Mr. Osman Salih, Mr.Salih 
Mahmoud Osman and Mr. Amjed Fareed but firmly condemns their detention which 
was arbitrary and aimed at punishing their peaceful and legitimate human 
rights activities.

						 

						The Observatory also calls upon the Sudanese authorities to order an 
immediate, independent and impartial investigation into alleged acts of 
ill-treatment against Ms. Amel Habani in order to bring all those 
responsible before a competent tribunal in accordance with international 
standards. More generally, the Observatory calls on the Sudanese authorities 
to put an end to all forms of harassment, including at the judicial level, 
against all human rights defenders in Sudan so that they are able to carry 
out their work without hindrance or fear of reprisals.

						 

Background information:
 

							On January 10, 2018, Mr. Osman Salih had been arrested by the NISS 
along with seven other individuals from the Alhuria Square in Al Obeid, 
North Kordofan as they participated in a peaceful protest against the 
increase in prices of basic commodities. Subsequently, Mr. Osman Salih was 
brought to the NISS offices in Al Obeid together with the other individuals. 
The NISS in Al Obeid carried out the arrest and took them to their 
offices.

political section in Khartoum Bahari.

detention.
