The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights
Defenders, a joint programme of the International Federation for Human Rights
(FIDH) and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent
intervention in the following situation in Sudan.
 
Description of the situation:
 
The Observatory has been informed by the African
Centre For Justice and Peace Studies  about
a wave of arbitrary arrests and incommunicado detention targeting human rights
defenders, including, Mr. Mohamed Salah Mohamed, President of the Nubian Students Association, which works in favour of
equal rights for all Sudanese, of the right to represent the Nubian culture and
against linguistic and ethnic discrimination, as well as Mr. Mohamed Al-Usbat, journalist and
activist, Ms. Nahid Gabralla, women’s rights activist, member of Sima Organisation for Child Rights,
Ms. Amira Osman,
women’s rights activist, member of “No to Women's Oppression”, Mr. Faisal Shabou, women’s rights
activist, member of Sima Organisation for Child Rights, Ms. Rashida Shams, member of Girifna[1] and member of “No to Women's Oppression”, Mr. Tarig El Sheikh, lawyer, member of
Darfur Bar Association, Ms. Marwa el Tigany, journalist and human rights defender, Mr. Al
Said Mustafa, Chairperson of Al Shiroog Cultural
Forum, Mr. Ramzi Yahia,
lawyer, affiliate of Al Shiroog Cultural Forum, Mr. Abdulgadir
Mahmoud, affiliate of Al Shiroog Cultural Forum,
Messrs. Radwan Daoud,
and Widad Dirwish,
members of Girifna.
 
According to the information received, between June 23
and July 12, 2012, the authorities launched a campaign of arrest targeting
dozens of human rights defenders, in the context of popular mass protests
calling for regime change, peace and justice. While some defenders have been
released, at least 13 remain in detention, some incommunicado, at the National
Intelligence and Security Services (NISS) premises in Khartoum. Few have been
charged.
 
Among them, Mr. Mohamed Salah, who was arrested on June 24, 2012 by the NISS, in Al Rayad area in Khartoum
state, after engaging in a public speech encouraging students to use their
right to peaceful protest. The NISS initially refused to disclose the
whereabouts of Mr. Mohamed Salah to his relatives, and subsequently rejected
their visit request without any explanation. The NISS finally authorised them
to visit him but only for ten minutes on July 14, 2012 in Kober prison,
Khartoum North, but ordered them not to inquire about his conditions of
detention. During the visit, Mr. Salah was shivering, his forehead was bruised
and the colour of his skin was altered. In addition, Mr. Salah informed his
family that he had no access to clean water in spite of a chronic kidney
disease. The NISS has also denied Mr. Salah any access to legal assistance and
to a meeting with a lawyer. 
 
Two of the 13 defenders were charged. Indeed, Messrs.
Radwan Daoud and Widad Dirwish were charged under Articles 63 (calling for
opposition to public authority by use of violence or criminal force) 65
(criminal and terrorist organisations), 67 (rioting), 69 (disturbance of public
peace), 71 (polluting the environment) and 72 (exposing ways and means of
transport and communication to danger) of the Criminal Code 1991. 
 
The other eleven human right defenders remain in
custody without charges. No information could be obtained regarding their
conditions of detention.
 
The Observatory expresses it deepest concern about the
arbitrary detention the 13 human rights defenders and fears for their physical and psychological integrity,
particularly in the current context of widespread torture and ill-treatment and
of arbitrary and incommunicado detention of activists in Sudan. The Observatory
therefore calls upon the authorities to guarantee in all circumstances their
physical and psychological integrity and release them immediately and
unconditionally, as their detention seems to merely aim at sanctioning their
human rights activities and the legitimate exercise of their right to freedom
of expression as protected by Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil
and Political Rights.
 
Actions requested:
 
The Observatory urges the authorities of Sudan to: 
 
i.        
Guarantee in all
circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of the 13 human rights
defenders mentioned above, as well as of all
human rights defenders in Sudan;
 
ii.       Put an end to any kind of harassment, including at the judicial level,
against the 13
human rights defenders mentioned above,
as well as of all human rights defenders in Sudan, and ensure in all
circumstances that they are able to carry out their activities without
hindrances;
 
iii.      Release the
13 human rights defenders mentioned above
immediately and unconditionally as their detention is arbitrary since it only
aims at sanctioning their human rights activities;
 
iv.     Conform in any circumstances with the provisions of the UN Declaration
on Human Rights Defenders, in particular its Article 1, which states that
“everyone has the right, individually or in association with others, to promote
the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the
national and international levels”, and its article 12.2 which provides that
“the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the
competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others,
against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse
discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his
or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present
Declaration”; 
 
v.       Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental
freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and
international instruments ratified by Sudan.
