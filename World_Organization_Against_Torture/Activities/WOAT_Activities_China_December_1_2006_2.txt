New information: The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about acts of harassment against Mrs. Geng He and Ms. Gao Gege, respectively the wife and daughter of Mr. Gao Zhisheng, a human rights lawyer and the director of the Beijing-based Shengzhi Law Office.  According to the information received, Mr. Gao Zhisheng’s family members have been placed under police surveillance since the beginning of his detention, on August 15, 2006 (See background information). In particular, on October 6, 2006, Mrs. Geng He was escorted by police agents, as she went to visit her husband at the Beijing N°2 Detention Center. During the entire visit, State Security officers stayed with her. Furthermore, on November 24, 2006, Mrs. Geng He was beaten and insulted by State Security officers, who were following her in Beijing. Allegedly, the police agents assaulted her when she asked them to leave. They broke her teeth, injured her hands and torn her coat into pieces. Besides, Ms. Gao Gege, who is 13 year-old, is constantly escorted by police agents, even when she goes to school. The Observatory condemns these acts of harassment against Mr. Gao Zhisheng’s family and expresses its deep concern about their physical and psychological integrity.  Background information: In November 2005, the activities of the Shengzhi Law Office were suspended by the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Justice for one year, and, in December 2005, Mr. Gao Zhisheng’s licence to practice law was revoked. These events followed the publication of an open letter on religious freedom. Mr. Gao’s appeal to review the decision to suspend his license was rejected. Since then, Mr. Gao had been under close police surveillance and constant harassment and intimidation. On August 15, 2006, Mr. Gao was arrested by more than 20 plainclothes officers from the Beijing Public Security Bureau at his sister’s home in Dongying City, Shandong Province, without showing any warrant or other decision by a public authority. The officers threatened Mr. Gao’s sister and told her to remain silent about Mr. Gao’s arrest. On August 18, 2006, the official Xinhua News Agency published a statement saying that Mr. Gao Zhisheng had been arrested “on suspicion of breaking the law,” although no details were provided about the specific crime he was alleged to have committed. The authorities prevented Mr. Gao’s lawyer from visiting his client, arguing of the fact that his case involved “state secrets”.  On October 12, 2006, Mr. Gao Zhisheng’s lawyer was informed that his client had been formally arrested and charged with “inciting to subvert the state”.  As a criminal defence lawyer, Mr. Gao Zhisheng was involved in sensitive cases relative to human rights violations, such as torture of members of the Falun Gong and Christian house church leaders, as well as arbitrary detention of petitioners seeking official accountability for acts of corruption. He also represented defendants in cases involving violations of freedom of expression and freedom of the press.    Actions required:  Please write to the Chinese authorities urging them to:   Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Gao Zhisheng, Mrs. Geng He and Ms. Gao Gege; Order the immediate and unconditional release of Mr. Gao Zhisheng as his detention is arbitrary; Put en end to the harassment against his family as well as against all human rights defenders in China; Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, and article 12.2, which states that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”; Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by the People’s Republic of China.
