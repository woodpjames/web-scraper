Brief description of the situation:The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Sudan Organisation Against Torture (SOAT), a member of the OMCT network, of a number of arbitrary arrests and judicial proceedings against political activists who held a peaceful demonstration in Khartoum on August 30, 2006.  According to the information received, on August 30, 2006, a demonstration was organised in the “green tomb square” (previously “UN square”), in Khartoum, by a coalition of political opposition parties and civil society groups including the Communist Party, the Umma Party, the Democratic Unionist Party, the New Democratic Forces Party (HAQ), the Arab Nassrist Party, and a number of trade unions. The aim of the demonstration was to protest against rising prices in petroleum and sugar ahead of a memorandum the organisers were planning to submit to the President.  It is reported that hundreds of Sudanese police and security forces violently broke up the peaceful demonstration, blocked access to the square, and closed access roads. Eyewitness accounts suggest that protestors were beaten and dispersed by armed riot police who shelled the area with tear gas. Mr. Sidig Mahgoub Munawar, a 62 year-old man, later suffocated to death from the effects of the gas.   During the incident, at least 35 protestors and bystanders were arbitrarily arrested, regardless of whether or not they were participating in the demonstration. The following day, on August 31, 2006, those arrested were brought before three courts in Khartoum and charged under Articles 67 (rioting) and 69 (disturbance of public peace) of the 1991 Sudanese Penal Code. In all, 11 individuals were found guilty and 25 were released after having been found not guilty or in the absence of valid charges.

Moreover, in the early hours of August 30, 2006, just prior to the demonstration, four prominent activists of various political parties and one journalist were arrested in Khartoum, and later taken to Khartoum North security offices (Political Section). Mr. Sattiaa Mohamed Alhag, lawyer and member of the Arab Nassrist Party, and Mr. Alhag Warrag Sid Ahmed, column writer with the Alsahafa daily and former Chairperson of “The New Forces Movement” (HAQ), were detained without interrogation for ten hours and released without charge on the same day. However, no information is available regarding the whereabouts of the remaining three detainees: Mr. Ibrahim Ahmed Alsheikh, member of the Sudanese National Congress Party, Mr. Alfatih Omer Alsaied, member of the Sudanese National Congress Party, and Mr. Mohamed Dia-aldin, member of the Baathist Arab Party.  Furthermore, the same coalition of political opposition parties and civil society groups were planning a second demonstration in Kosti on September 2, 2006. However, around 6:00 pm on September 1, 2006, four members of the Communist Party of Sudan were arrested by security forces in Kosti while advertising the demonstration over a loudspeaker system from a car, even though they had secured prior permission to make public announcements. The four men, namely Mr. Amar Elsir Ahmed, Mr. Mustafa Abas Hassan, Mr. Marwa and Mr. Mudather, were taken to the offices of the National Security in Kosti, where they were interrogated for three to four hours, before being released without charge. That same evening, the organisers were informed by the Security Committee in Kosti that permission to hold the protest on the next day had been withdrawn for security reasons.   The International Secretariat of OMCT expresses its deep concern over these events, and urges the Sudanese authorities to immediately undertake its responsibility to disseminate the Bill of Rights guaranteed by the Interim Constitution across the country and to its security apparatus, including Article 40 (1) which states that “the right to peaceful assembly shall be guaranteed” and that “every person shall have the right to freedom of association with others, including the right to form or joint political parties”, as well as Article 29 that states that “no person shall be subjected to arrest, detention, deprivation or restriction of his liberty except for reasons and in accordance with procedures prescribed by law”.  Requested action:Please write to the authorities in Sudan urging them to:  1.	Locate the whereabouts of Mr. Ibrahim Ahmed Alsheikh, Mr. Alfatih Omer Alsaied and Mr. Mohamed Dia-aldi and ensure their physical and psychological integrity, as well as that of all above-mentioned persons; 2.	Order the immediate release of all persons detained in the absence of valid charges, and if such charges exist, ensure that they are given a prompt and fair trial, in which their procedural rights are guaranteed at all times; 3.	Order a thorough and impartial investigation into all these events, including into the death of Mr. Sidig Mahgoub Munawar, in order to identify those responsible, bring them to trial and apply the civil, penal and/or administrative sanctions as provided by law; 4.
