Brief description of the situation:  The Observatory has been informed by the Society of Russian-Chechen Friendship (SRCF) of the illegal search of their offices and the arrest of their correspondent Khamzat Kuchiyev.<(b> On July 12, 2004 at approximately 6:30 pm, police officers entered the Ingush regional office of SRCF, located in the village of Karabulak, and began to search the premises without an official warrant. At the time, Khamzat Kuchiyev, his wife Raisa and the organization’s driver, Zaur Kharipov, were present in the office.  Mr. Kuchiyev phoned Imran Ezhiyev, the director of the office, to inform him of the events, after which, the police forbade him to use the phone. When Mr. Ezhiyev arrived, there were at least 20 men armed with machine guns searching the third floor of the office, as well as several armed officers at the entrance. Mr. Ezhiyev recognized Ruslan Khamkhjoyev, head of Police for the Republic of Ingushetiya, as conducting the operation, as well as several officers of the local Karabulak police. The police confiscated computers, office equipment and printed material, including statements from individuals addressed to SRCF.  A jar of black powder, similar to magnesium, was “found” by the police in the computer room; there were no witnesses to this discovery and it is feared that the potentially explosive substance may have been planted by the police. Individuals were brought in to sign blank documents, apparently to be the certificate of the search. When Mr. Ezhiyev advised them not to sign the blank documents, the police pushed him to the door and threatened, “you should not have complained about us.” At 7:30 pm, Mr. Kuchiyev was taken into custody and removed from the office.  The search of the offices continued until approximately 8:30 pm.  Following urgent appeals to Ella Pamfilova, chairperson of the Russian Commission on Human Rights, and Murat Zyazikov, President of Ingushetia, requesting their intervention in the situation, Mr. Kuchiyev was released from the police station between 10 and 11 pm the same night. Though he was treated well and received an apology, he was also asked not to complain about what occurred.  The illegal search of the SRCF offices and detainment of Khamzat Kuchiyev are evidence of a continuing attempt to disrupt the human rights activities of the Society of Russian-Chechen Friendship. These attempts are also evidenced by the previous arrests of the regional director Imran Ezhiyev in 2000 and 2001 and his kidnapping in March 2003 (see Observatory Appeal RUS 001/0303/OBS 012.1), as well as the kidnapping and murder of SRCF volunteer Aslan Sheripovich Davletukaev in January 2004 (see Observatory Appeal RUS 001/0104/OBS 006).  In light of these events, as well as his surveillance in January 2004 (see Observatory Appeal RUS 001/0303/OBS 012.2), Imran Ezhiyev has increasing fears for his safety and that of his family.  The protection of human rights defenders is a State responsibility, as laid out in the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders adopted by consensus of the UN General Assembly on December 9, 1998. Article 1 of the Declaration states that "everyone has the right, individually or in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels,” and more specifically, Article 12(2) states that "the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration.” The Observatory calls upon the Russian authorities to fulfil its obligations to human rights defenders by conducting an immediate and thorough investigation concerning the illegal search of the SRCF offices and the detention of Mr. Kuchiyev and to ensure the safety of Mr. Ezhiyev and his family.   Actions requested:  Please write to the Russian authorities urging them to:   i.conduct a fair, impartial and independent inquiry into these events in order to identify the perpetrators, bring them to justice and pronounce sentences proportional to the gravity of the crime;   ii.	ensure that Mr. Imran Ezhiyev and his family receive adequate protection;   iii.	adopt immediate measures to put an end to all acts of violence and harassment against human rights defenders and guarantee in all circumstances that human rights defenders and organisations are able to carry out their work;   iv.	comply with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, in particular Article 1, and Article 12(2), mentioned above,   v.	more generally, to comply with the terms of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and regional and international mechanisms concerning human rights, to which the Russian Federation is a party.
