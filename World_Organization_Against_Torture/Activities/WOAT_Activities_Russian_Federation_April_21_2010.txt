Illegal transfer to another detention centre/ Incommunicado detention/ Fear for the safety

The International Secretariat of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) requests your URGENT intervention in the following situation in the Russian Federation/ Republic of Chechnya.
Brief description of the situation
The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Russian-Chechen Friendship Society (RCFS), a member of OMCT SOS-Torture Network, about the illegal transfer of Mr. Albert Saaev, 28 years old computer expert and known hacker, who is serving a prison sentence in Moscow in relation to an attack on the official Chechen President’s web portal, to Grozny, Chechnya, where he is currently detained incommunicado. OMCT fears that he may be at risk of torture and ill-treatment.
According to the information received, on 14 April 2010, Mr. Albert Saaev was transferred from the Lefortovo’s detention centre in Moscow to Grozny, allegedly for investigation purposes into the above mentioned attack, without his family and lawyers being informed thereof. Mr. Albert Saaev would be currently detained in SIZO (pre-trial detention centre) in Grozny. Since his transfer, the lawyer appointed by his family in Grozny has been reportedly denied access to him and no further information has been provided with regard to the exact reasons of his transfer to Grozny. The family is intending to appeal the decision.
It is worth noting that Mr. Albert Saaev, who had carried out the attack on the official web portal of the President of the Republic of Chechnya, www.chechnyaTODAY.com, on 26 June 2009, was sentenced, on 1 April 2010, to two years in prison and to a fine of 35’000 rubble for “illegal access to digital information” and “creation and distribution of hacker’s software” under Article 272 §2 and 273 §1 of the Russian Criminal Code by the Kuzminskiy district court of Moscow. He was to serve his sentence in Lefortovo’s detention centre in Moscow where he was detained since 23 September 2009 following his arrest in Moscow.
The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned about the safety of Mr. Albert Saaev. OMCT fears that he may be at risk of torture and ill-treatment, in particular since he is detained incommunicado. Accordingly, OMCT urges the competent authorities to guarantee his physical and psychological integrity, at all times, in accordance with regional and international human rights instruments ratified by the Russian Federation, and in particular articles 2 and 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights.
OMCT is also gravely concerned about the transfer of Mr. Albert Saaev from Lefortovo’s detention centre in Moscow to SIZO in Grozny, a transfer which was carried out without any prior notification to Mr. Albert Saaev’s family and lawyers and which exact reasons remain unknown.
