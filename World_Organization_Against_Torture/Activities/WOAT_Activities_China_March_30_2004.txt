Brief description of the situation:  The Observatory has been informed by Human Rights in China that three “Tiananmen Mothers” have been arrested on March 28, and their homes have been subsequently searched by the police.  According to the information received, Ding Zilin was arrested in her home on March 28, by three police officers without presenting any legal documentation.   Zhang Xianling was apprehended in her home on March 28, by two police officers who presented a warrant stating that she was being detained under Article 50 of China's National Security Law. Police told Zhang Xianling's husband that the Tiananmen Mothers Campaign and the Tiananmen Mothers as a group were reactionary organisations through which entities inside and outside China were conspiring to harm national security and to incite subversion of state power.  Huang Jinping was arrested in her home on March 28, by National Security police bearing an arrest warrant.   Ding Zilin's 17 year-old son was killed by the People's Liberation Army soldiers during the violent crackdown against protesters in Beijing on June 4, 1989. Since then, she has been collecting information about the victims of the Tiananmen crackdown and calling upon the Chinese government to make appropriate reparations. She has become the most prominent spokeperson for victims' families in revealing the truth and demanding justice.  Zhang Xianling is another key spokeperson for the victims' families. Her 19 year-old son was also killed on June 4, while Huang Jinping, another active campaigner, lost her husband in the Tiananmen crackdown.  In Hong Kong a video CD was recently released presenting the testimonies of six family members of June 4th victims, including Ding Zilin, Zhang Xianling and Huang Jinping. This video CD has been taken to Geneva by members of the Hong Kong-based support group, the Tiananmen Mothers Campaign, to present it to the Commission’s Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances. Some observers believe the intention to present this VCD to the UN was the impetus for the arrests of Ding Zilin, Zhang Xianling and Huang Jinping.  The Observatory strongly condemns the arrest of Ding Zilin, Zhang Xianling and Huang Jinping, which paradoxically took place while the UN Commission on Human Rights is meeting in Geneva and will examine a draft resolution on the human rights situation in China.  The Observatory considers the arrest of the three Tiananmen Mothers as arbitrary because it aims at sanctioning their peaceful activities in favour of human rights. Their detention violates the right to freedom of expression as well as the UN Declaration on human rights defenders. The Observatory consequently urges the Chinese authorities to release them immediately and unconditionally.     Action requested:  Please write to the authorities of China, urging them to:  i. Release immediately and unconditionally Ding Zilin, Zhang Xianling and Huang Jinping and  guarantee their physical and psychological integrity in all circumstances.  ii. Conform with the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the United Nations' General Assembly on 9 December 1998, in particular its article 1, which states that " everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels ".  iii. Conform with the provisions of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, and with the oher international instruments binding China.
