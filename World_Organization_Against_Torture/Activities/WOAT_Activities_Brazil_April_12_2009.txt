It refers to a clear and observable phenomenon that sees the poorest members of Brazilian society identified by state and quasi-state actors (the police, and in particular the military police, elements of the legal system, prison guards and militias) as criminal, or potentially criminal elements and on that basis being targeted for extortion, arbitrary arrest and detention, physical violence or, indeed, summary execution.
