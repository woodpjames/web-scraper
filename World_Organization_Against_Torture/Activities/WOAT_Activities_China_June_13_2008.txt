Brief description of the situation The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by The Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy (TCHRD), member of OMCT SOS-Torture network, about the violent arrest and detention of three Tibetans, namely Namsey Lhamo, a 30 years old farmer from Raga Village, Dando Township, Kardze County, Tenzin Dargyal, a 32 years old farmer from Kardze County and a monk whose identity could not be ascertained at the time of issuing the appeal.  According to the information received, on 11 June 2008 at around 11:00am, Namsey Lhamo, Tenzin Dargyal and the monk were severely beaten and detained by the Kardze County Public Security Bureau (PSB) officials. They were reportedly participating in a peaceful protest, staged by a few Tibetan residents of Kardze County, raising Pro-Tibet slogans and distributing pamphlets calling among others for "the swift return of the Dalai Lama to Tibet", "freedom in Tibet", "release of those arrested in recent protests" and "China quit Tibet". They event took place at one of the road intersections at the Kardze county main market square, in Kardze County, Kardze "Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture" ('TAP') Sichuan Province. According to the same information, Namsey Lhamo, Tenzin Dargyal and the monk were then taken to the Kardze PSB detention centre but their current conditions of detention remain unknown.  The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned for the safety of the three above mentioned individuals, whose conditions of detention are currently unknown and who, according to the information received, were arrested and detained solely for their peaceful political and religious beliefs and the rights to freedom of expression, association and assembly. OMCT fears that they may be subject to torture and ill-treatment. OMCT recalls that China is a State party to the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment which prohibits torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. In line with their obligations under this treaty, it is incumbent on the Chinese authorities to consider seriously any allegations of torture and ill-treatment, and to undertake a thorough and impartial investigation in this regard. OMCT urges the authorities to conform with China’s international human rights obligations, commitments that were reaffirmed on the occasion of its election as a member of the new United Nations Human Rights Council. Actions Requested Please write to the authorities in the People’s Republic of China urging them to:   Immediately locate the whereabouts of the above mentioned individuals;  Guarantee, in all circumstances, their physical and psychological integrity;  Guarantee immediate and unconditional access to legal representation, their families and any medical treatment they may require;  Order their immediate release in the absence of valid legal charges, or, if such charges exist, bring them before an impartial, independent, competent and fair tribunal and guarantee their procedural rights at all times;  Order a thorough and impartial investigation into these events in order to identify all those responsible, bring them to trial and apply the penal and/or administrative sanctions as provided by law;  Guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
