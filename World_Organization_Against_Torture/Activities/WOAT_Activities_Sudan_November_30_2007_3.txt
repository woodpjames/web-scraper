New information: The Observatory has been informed by the Sudan Organisation Against Torture (SOAT) about new acts of harassment against Ms. Mashair Abdullah Omer, Financial Officer of the Khartoum Centre for Human Rights and Environmental Development (KCHRED). According to the information received, on November 28, 2007, Ms. Mashair Abdullah Omer was summoned again for further questioning and detained at the offices of the political section of Sudan’s National Security Service (NSS) in Khartoum North, from around 9 am until around 8.30 pm. While in detention, she would reportedly have been ill-treated and questioned about the structure and sources of funding of the KCHRED. The Observatory expresses its deep concern with the continuing interference on the activities of human rights defenders by the Sudanese authorities, and fears that such acts of intimidation directly aim at weakening the Sudanese independent civil society. The Observatory further recalls that the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Sudan, Ms. Sima Samar, stated in her latest report that she had witnessed “a noticeable crackdown on human rights defenders, lawyers, journalists, [...]”[1]. Background information: On November 21, 2007, two persons from the political section of the NSS arrived at KCHRED. They took Mr. Amir Mohamed Suleiman, KCHR Chairperson, and Ms. Mashair Abdullah Omer to the NSS premises in Khartoum North, where they were detained from around noon to around 8.30 p.m., and were interrogated about personal matters as well as about the financial and administrative structures of the KCHR. On the same day, Ms. Madiha Abdullah, a journalist with the daily newspaper al-Ayyam, which has faced frequent censorship, and a collaborator of the al-Laq Press Centre, a Khartoum-based non-governmental organisation that carries out activities including training journalists, as well as Dr. Nagib Nagmeldin, former coordinator of SOAT’s activities in Sudan, were also detained and questioned at the NSS offices in Khartoum North. On November 22, 2007, Mr. Amir Suleiman and Dr Nagib Nagmeldin were ordered to return to the NSS offices at 2 p.m, and Ms. Omer was required to provide documentation relating to the finances of KCHRED. Mr. Suleiman complied with the order and left the NSS offices at 6 p.m. Furthermore, on November 4, 5 and 6, 2007, three journalists and human rights defenders, namely Mr. Faisal el-Bagir, a SOAT member and a reporter for Reporters Without Borders (Reporters sans frontières - RSF), Ms. Lemia el-Jaili Abu Bakr and Mr. Sabah Mohamed Adam, both members of KCHRED, were summoned to the same NSS offices in Khartoum North, detained for several hours and subjected to questioning along similar lines. Early November, Mr. Faizal el-Bagir published an editorial on ARTICLE 19’s blog, the Khartoum Advocacy Centre, launched as part of the implementation of its project “Promoting freedom of expression and civil society involvement in developing democratic Media legislation in Sudan”. His editorial was meant to be published in August in Al-Midan newspaper but the 15,000 copies of the issue containing the editorial were seized. His article was critical of the ongoing abuses by the Sudanese national government on freedom of expression, and towards the media in Sudan.
