The International Secretariat of OMCT has received new information regarding the following situation in India.  New Information  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by People's Watch - Tamil Nadu, a member of the OMCT network, that the Home Ministry has extended the stay of execution of Mr Govindaswamy indefinitely.  OMCT stresses that it is strongly opposed to the death penalty as an extreme form of cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment and a violation of the right to life, as proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international human rights instruments.  Brief reminder of the situation  OMCTwas informed by People’s Watch –Tamil Nadu that  on 12th July 2000, the Ministry of Home Affairs in New Delhi ordered a 10-day stay of execution of Mr. Govindaswamy who was scheduled to be hanged on 14th July 2000.  Mr. Govindaswamy, an inmate at Coimbatore Central Prison in the state of Tamil Nadu, was tried in 1985 for the murder of 5 people the year before.  In 1987 he was acquitted on the grounds that the prosecution case was not proved beyond a doubt.  In 1997, however, the High Court reversed this judgement and sentenced him to death after the government appealed against his acquittal.  In 1998, the Supreme Court dismissed an appeal and upheld the death sentence.  It is further reported that the President of India had rejected a previous clemency petition in October 1999.  The execution was temporarily stayed by the High Court of Tami Nadu after a petition was filed on Govindaswamy’s behalf calling for the death sentence to be commuted on the grounds of unacceptable delay in the consideration of his clemency petition (over one year).  However, the Tamil Nadu High Court ultimately rejected this petition.  Since, a series of 15-day stay of execution have been granted.  Action Requested  Please write to the authorities in India urging them to:  i.	commute the death sentence of Mr. Govindaswamy and order a review of his case;  ii.	guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
