The Observatory for the
Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the International
Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation Against Torture
(OMCT), requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in Belarus.
 
Description of
the situation:
 
The Observatory has been
informed by reliable sources about the imposition of fines on Messrs. Raman
Yurhel, member of the Belarusian Helsinki Committee (BHC), and Viktar
Sazonau and Uladzimir Khilmanovich, members of the Human Rights Center
“Viasna”.
 
According to the
information received, on January 5, 2013, Messrs. Raman Yurhel, Viktar Sazonau
and Uladzimir Khilmanovich were fined a total of 4.5 million Belarusian roubles
(1.5 million each) by the Leninski District Court of Hrodna after being charged
under Article 23.34 of the Administrative Code, which provides punishment for
violating the procedure of “organising or conducting a mass event or
demonstration”. 
 
The three defenders were
charged after they photographed themselves on December 10, 2012 in the town of
Hrodna, Belarus, with a portrait of imprisoned Belarusian human rights defender
Ales Bialiatski and brochures containing the text of the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights. The police issued charge sheets on December 18, 2012, after
the December-10 action was qualified as an “unauthorised mass event”. The
charge sheets, which contain a description the administrative violations
supposedly committed, were brought to the knowledge of the three defenders on
December 19, 2012. The three cases were then merged into a single case, and
scheduled to be heard on January 5, 2013 before the Leninski District Court of
Hrodna.
 
The hearing lasted 2.30
hours. No witnesses nor any evidence were presented during that hearing and all
the accusations were based solely on speculation and reports of police
officials. Presiding Judge Vital Letska also failed to interrupt the hearing at
any point over the 2.30 hours, before issuing the court ruling. 
 
Actions
requested:
 
Please write to the
Belarusian authorities, urging them to:
 
i. Guarantee
in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Messrs. Raman Yurhel, Viktar Sazonau and
Uladzimir Khilmanovich, as well as of all human
rights defenders in Belarus;
 
ii.
Put an end to any kind of harassment - including at the judicial and
administrative levels - against Messrs. Raman Yurhel, Viktar Sazonau and
Uladzimir Khilmanovich, as well as against all other human rights defenders in
Belarus;
 
iii.
Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders,
adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998,
especially:
-
its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in
association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and
realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and
international levels”,
-
its Article 6 (b) and (c), which states that “Everyone has the right,
individually and in association with others […] as provided for in human rights
and other applicable international instruments, freely to publish, impart or
disseminate to others views, information and knowledge on all human rights and
fundamental freedoms and [...] to study, discuss, form and hold opinions on the
observance, both in law and in practice, of all human rights and fundamental
freedoms and, through these and other appropriate means, to draw public
attention to those matters”.
-
and its Article 12.2, which provides that “the State shall take all necessary
measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone,
individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats,
retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other
arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the
rights referred to in the present Declaration” ;
 
iv.
Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in
accordance with international human rights standards and international
instruments ratified by the Belarusian Republic.
