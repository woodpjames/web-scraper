Congo: harassment and interrogationCase COD 260602	 Arbitrary detention / Torture/ Extra-judicial execution   The International Secretariat of OMCT requests your URGENT intervention in the following situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  Brief description of the facts  The International Secretariat of OMCT was informed by LIZADEEL (La ligue de la zone Afrique pour la défense des droits des enfants, élèves et étudiants), a member of the OMCT network, that Mr. Dominique Walama Konzo, was arrested by the DEMIAP outside of Kintambo and detained for over six weeks, during which he was reportedly subjected to torture, bringing about his death on Monday 24th June 2002, after a late and futile intervention by the doctor of the Kokolo camp’s medical center.  According to our sources, Mr. Walama, who was 26, single and a native of the Equateur province, district of North Ubangi, Yakoma territory, Abuzi sector, resident at Avenue Jupiter, 73, Q/résidentiel in the district of Limete in Kinshasa, owed 7,000 dollars to a certain woman. This woman allegedly used her influence to have him arrested by DEMIAP, instead of acting through judicial means, as is ordained in Congolese law.  The International Secretariat of OMCT eagerly awaits the opening of an investigation into the incident that was the subject of this appeal. Nevertheless, OMCT fears that the perpetrators of this crime will not be brought to justice, given the results of the investigation till now, and that the family of Mr.Walama will not be guaranteed adequate reparation.  OMCT would like to recall the decision of the authorities of the Democratic Republic of the Congo concerning the closure of all prison cells not linked to the justice system made shortly after President Kabila’s assumption of power in March 2001. The International Secretariat of OMCT fears that these cells still operate despite the decision made in March 2001.
