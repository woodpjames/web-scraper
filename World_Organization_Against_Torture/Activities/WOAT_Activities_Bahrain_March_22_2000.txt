Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT has received new information from BHRO stating that Abdul-Wahab Hussain was arrested on 17th March 2000 after spending an hour at home after his release earlier that evening at 9:30pm, following an order from the High Court of Appeal to release him on 14th March 2000.  According to his brother, Ibrahim Hussain, “He spent around one hour at home before police took him back.  They said they wanted to complete arrangements for his release.”  He further added that the police promised to release Abdul-Wahab after the Moslem Eid al-Adha feast, which officially ends on Sunday.    According to the information received, Abdul Wahab Hussain remains in detention and the SIS is threatening his family with the detention of Abdul Wahab for another three years in accordance with the 1974 State Security Law, which allows for a maximum administrative detention of three years, a law which in itself falls short of International standards for a fair trial.    Previously, on 29th February 2000, Abdul Wahab Hussain had appeared before the State Security Court in a hearing to consider a complaint filed by his defence lawyer.  The complaint was based on the fact that Mr. Hussain has been in detention for more than three years (since 22nd January 1996) which is the maximum period of administrative detention affirmed in the 1974 State Security Act.  The hearing was postponed until 14th March 2000.  Furthermore, according to the information received, earlier, Mr. Hussain was put under pressure by three SIS officers, Adel Flaifel and two British officers, to sign a statement apologizing for his actions and undertaking not to carry out acts calling for political reform, or incite others to do so, and not to partake in any public speaking, including religious sermons.  If this was signed he would be pardoned by the Amir. However, Mr. Abdul-Wahab Hussain refused to sign the pre-prepared statement.  The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned by the prolonged detention of Abdul-Wahab Hussain.  OMCT is preoccupied by the fact that there is no guarantee to a fair and impartial trial from the State Security Court.  Also, that his detention is in direct contradiction with Article 9 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which states that, “No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile.”  Requested Action  Please write to the Bahrain authorities urging that they :   i.	order the immediate release of Abdul-Wahab Hussain; ii.	carry out a full and impartial investigation into this alleged arbitrary detentions, ill-treatment and alleged threats to Abdul-Wahab Hussain and his family, in order to identify those responsible, bring them to trial and apply the penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions provided by law; iii.	put an immediate end to the use of arbitrary detention of  people by the police and abrogate 1974 State Security Law and all national laws which are not in compliance with international human rights standards.  iv.	guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
