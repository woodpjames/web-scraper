Brief description of the facts:  The Observatory was informed by a number of Guatemalan and International Organisations, notably Greenpeace, of the assassination of two members of the Consejo Nacional de Areas Protegidas (CONAP), M. Erwin Haroldo Ochoa Lopez, lawyer, and M. Julio Armando Vasquez Ramirez, administrative assistant on 29th February 2000 in Izabal, Guatemala.  According to the information received, M. Erwin Haroldo Ochoa Lopez and Julio Armando Vasquez Ramirez were killed as a result of their activities and that of their organisation which promotes the protection of the ecosystem and the environment in the region of Izabal; in the framework of their organisation, the fight against illegal deforestation, dredging and loss of sediment in the region of La Graciosa and against the destruction of swamps in the Chocon Machacas.  The Observatory believes that these assassinations are part of the general hostility and repression which those working in favour of the protection and defence of human rights, as well as the protection and defence of the environment, are subjected to.   Actions requested :  Please write to the Guatemalan authorities urging them to:  i. carry out a full and impartial inquiry into the deaths of  M. Erwin Haroldo Ochoa Lopez and M. Julio Armando Vasquez Ramirez, in order to identify those responsible bring them to trial and apply the penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions as provided by law;  ii. adopt the appropriate measures in order to guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of the members of the Consejo Nacional de Areas Protegidas (CONAP) and other human rights non-governmental, including those environmental defence organisations;  iii. ensure the implementation of the provisions of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 9 1998 (Declaration concerning the rights and responsibilities of individuals, groups and institutions to promote and protect universally recognized human rights and fundamental liberties) in particular its Article 1 which  provides that «Every person has the right, individually or collectively, to promote the protection and fulfilment of human rights and fundamental liberties at the national and international level.»     iv. more generally, guarantee the effective respect of fundamental human rights and freedoms in accordance with the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and international and regional Pacts and Covenants ratified by Guatemala.
