		Judicial harassment

Turkey
		May 16, 2017

		 

		The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a 
partnership of FIDH and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), has 
received new information and requests your urgent intervention in the 
following situation in Turkey.

		 

New information:

		 

		The Observatory has been informed about the schedule of the trial of Mr. 
Levent Pişkin, a human rights lawyers member of the 
Association of lawyers for Freedom (Ozgurlukcu Hukukcular Dernegi – 
OHD), Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transsexual and Intersexed (LGBTI) rights 
activist and member of the Justice Commission of the Peoples’ 
Democratic Party (HDP)[1] 
.
            
		

		According to the information received,on May 18, 2017,the first hearing on 
the merits in Mr. Levent Pişkin’s trial is schedule to take place 
before the 8th Heavy Penal Court in Bursa.

		 

		Following his arrest on November 14, 2016 and his provisional release two 
days later, on November 16, Mr. Levent Pişkin received an indictment in 
April, 2017, almost six months after his arrest. According to the 
indictment, Mr. Levent Pişkin was charged for fulfilling his duties as an 
attorney.The Bursa Chief Public Prosecutor Gökhan Şen indeed accused 
Mr. Pişkin of “using his attorney ID to visit his client 
Selahattin Demirtaş, who is currently jailed in Edirne Penitentiary, and 
accepting [his fellow attorney Cahit] Kırkazak’s proposal to deliver 
a message from Mr. Demirtaş to the German magazine Der Spiegel, in 
order to bring the arrest of Mr. Demirtaş to the international agenda and 
into lobbying efforts on the international stage”.

		 

		Specifically, the prosecution claimed that many stories published in  
Der Spiegel “contain insults to the Turkish state and 
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, spread unfounded news that insults, teases 
and belittles the country, and pursues an editorial policy that stokes 
public opinion against the country in order to discredit the nation on the 
international stage”.

		 

		The indictment further refers to Mr. Levent Pişkin’s phone call 
with fellow attorney Cahit Kırkazak, who was taken into custody in the same 
investigation as him, as a “phone communication within the 
organisational hierarchy”, and Mr. Pişkin’s membership in 
a WhatsApp group named “HDPIstanbul” was also included in his 
list of crimes.

		 

		The Observatory deplores the continuing judicial harassment against Mr. 
Levent Pişkin, which seems to merely aim at sanctioning his human rights 
activities as an attorney. The Observatory calls upon the Turkish 
authorities to drop all the charges against him and, in the meantime, to 
ensure that all judicial proceedings against him are carried out in full 
compliance with the right to due process, the right to a fair trial and the 
right to be presumed innocent, as protected under international law.

		 

Background information:

		 

		On November 14, 2016, at 5:30 a.m. the police raided in Mr. Levent 
Pişkin’s apartment, confiscated some of his belongings, including his 
computer and phone, and arrested him. The Public Prosecution Office ordered 
his placement in custody and he was transferred to Bursa Detention 
Centre.

		 

		The arrest was related to his visit to his client, Member of Parliament, 
Mr. Selahattin Demirtaş, HDP co-Chair, detained since November 4, 2016. 
Some media accused him of conveying  Mr. Selahattin Demirtaş’s 
message to a German Magazine which could be used as propaganda.

		 

		At the day of his arrest, he was supposed to defend 46 lawyers, 
 facing judicial harassment since 2011 for exercising their 
profession,.

		 

		Moreover, Mr. Levent Pişkin has been targeted of several acts of 
harassment over the past years. In March 2014, he was sued by President 
Erdogan and sentenced by the Istanbul’s 14th Criminal Court to 
pay 10 thousand liras (around $3,700) in damages for “insult, slander 
or heavy provocation of a public official for their public service”. 
He reacted to a speech by Mr. Erdogan, Prime minister at the time, who said 
that “if Alevilik is about loving Ali, I’m a perfect 
Alevi”, and tweeted “Waiting for PM to declare, ‘I am a 
perfect fag’. Obviously I will not learn how to be a fag from you. 
Kisses.#AnayasadaLGBT [LGBT in the Constitution ]”.

		 

		In 2016, a bomb exploded in his garden which is apparently related to 
Turkish nationalists.

		 

Actions requested:

		i. Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity

Turkey;

		 

		ii. Put an end to all forms of harassment, including at judicial level, 
against Mr. Levent Pişkin, as well as other human rights defenders in

		iii. Comply with all the provisions of the United Nations Declaration on 
Human Rights Defenders, in particular with Articles 1, 6(a), 9, 11 and 
12.2;
