Judicial harassment
Egypt
May 17, 2017The Observatory for the Protection of
Human Rights Defenders, a partnership of FIDH and the World Organisation
Against Torture (OMCT), has received new information and requests your urgent
intervention in the following situation in Egypt.
New information:
The Observatory has been informed by
reliable sources about the continued judicial harassment and the restrictions
to freedom of association faced by several Egyptian human rights organisations,
as well as their staff and members, in the framework of the so-called case No.
173/2011, also know as the “NGO foreign funding case” (see background
information).
According to the information received, Mr.
Mohamed Zaree , Egypt Director of
the Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies (CIHRS) was summoned to appear on
May 15, 2017, before the investigative judge within the framework of the “NGO
Foreign Funding” case.
On that day, the judge agreed to a request
from Mohamed Zaree and his defence lawyers to view his case file, which no
lawyer has ever been able to access in its entirety within the framework of
case No. 173/2011. The interrogation session was adjourned to May 24, 2017, to
allow the defendant and his lawyers to review some of the case papers.
The Observatory recalls that CIHRS was
amongst the 37 NGOs listed in the 2011 Government Fact-Finding Committee report
that could be targeted under the case No. 173/2011. On September 17, 2016, the
Cairo Criminal Court in Zeinhom ordered the freezing of CIHRS’s assets and
those of its Director, Mr. Bahey el din Hassan, as well as those of several
other defenders and NGOs. Several CIHRS members have also experienced various
acts of harassment and threats. One year ago, in May 2016, Mr. Mohamed Zaree
was informed by the authorities at the Cairo International Airport that a
travel ban had been imposed on him by order of an investigative judge (see
background information).
The Observatory strongly condemns the
ongoing judicial harassment against all human rights defenders and human rights
organisations targeted within the framework of case No. 173/2011 and all
subsequent violations of their right to a fair trial, including their inability
to access the case’s file, as well as the right to freedom of movement.
Consequently, the Observatory urges the
Egyptian authorities to immediately and unconditionally put an end to all forms
of harassment against them as they only aim at sanctioning their legitimate
human rights activities.
Background Information:
Since 2011, the Egyptian Government has
launched a judicial harassment campaign against civil society organisations on
the pretext that they received unauthorised foreign funding under criminal case
No. 173/2011, known as the “foreign funding case against NGOs”.
The 2011 Government Fact-Finding Committee
report, which formed the basis of the first trial in 2012, listed 37 NGOs who
could be targeted under this “foreign funding case against NGOs”. That list
included ACIJLP, CIHRS, LCHR, the Egyptian Democratic Academy (EDA), HMLC,
ANHRI, EIPR, El Nadim Center for the Management and Rehabilitation of Victims
of
Violence and Torture, the Egyptian Center
for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR), the Arab Penal Reform Organization, the
Egyptian Center for the Right to Education, , the Egyptian Association for
Community Participation Enhancement (ACPE), Nazra for Feminist Studies, the
Appropriate Communications Technologies (ACT), among others.
The first set of investigations targeted
international and foreign NGOs. On June 4, 2013, the North Cairo Criminal Court
sentenced 43 Egyptian and foreign staff members of five foreign civil society
organisations to imprisonment ranging from one (suspended) to five years of
prison for “managing unlicensed branches” of their organisations, “conducting
research, political training, surveys, and workshops without licenses”, “training
political parties and groups” and “illegally receiving foreign funding”. Though
none of the defendants were forced to serve their sentences either because they
were abroad or in the case of the junior staff had their sentences suspended,
the court ordered the confiscation of their funds and the closure of
Egypt-based branches of Freedom House, the International Republican Institute,
the National Democratic Institute, the International Centre for Journalists
(ICFJ), and Konrad Adenauer Foundation.
The second case targets Egyptian civil
society organisations that have received foreign or international funding. It
started with the ultimatum made by the Ministry of Social Solidarity (MoSS)1 for Egyptian human rights organisations to register by late 2014 under
Law 84/2002 or face closure. One month later, a new wave of harassment
targeting human rights NGOs began.
In September 2014, President Al-Sisi
signed into law amendments to Article 78 of the Penal Code. These amendments
include the provision that receiving foreign funding for the purpose of “harming
national security” is punishable by life imprisonment.
In late 2014, the Investigating Judge in
charge of the case appointed a technical committee from the MoSS2 to determine whether Egyptian organisations under review operate as
civic associations without being registered as such under Law 84/2002, and to
examine documents related to their sources of funding. The committee first
examined the EDA. It is noteworthy to note that despite the EDA's registration
in compliance with the ultimatum3, they are
still being investigated. In January 2015, the judge issued travel bans against
Messrs. Hossam al-Din Ali, Chairman
of the EDA, Ahmed Ghoneim, Deputy,
as well as Ms. Israa Abdel Fattah and Bassem Samir, who previously worked in
the same organisation.
In June 2015, Mr. Negad El Borai, the Director of United Group, was interrogated by
the Investigating Judge about its sources of funding and legal status4. In March 2016, the United Group was summonsed for the fourth time. On
May 17, 2016, he was summoned for the fifth hearing session5, but at the very last minute it was postponed to an undetermined date.
On June 9, 2015, the Investigating Judge
mandated the technical committee to visit the Cairo office of the CIHRS in
order to examine whether the CIHRS engages in activities of civic associations
under the provisions of Law 84/2002. The committee requested the staff present
in the office to provide documentation relating to the administration of the
NGO, such as its registration, founding contract and statute, as well as the
budgets, financial accounts, and funding contracts for the past four years. One
additional demand the staff were instructed to comply with was to provide
documentation that proved that the CIHRS was not conducting NGO work.
On June 16, 2015, the CIHRS was presented
with a summons letter to appear on June 17, before the Investigating Judge
within the framework of the case No. 173/2011. However, the CIHRS refused to
accept the summons letter as it failed to comply with the legal requirements in
force and subsequently submitted its arguments in writing to the representative
of the Investigating Judge. Since then, CIHRS and its members had not received
any further summons, until those of March 13 and 14, 2016 (see below).
In
July 2015, the HMLC was also subjected to the same review.
In December 2015, the ANHRI received a
phone call from the technical committee, which asked to conduct an inspection,
but due to the absence of ANHRI’s Director, Mr. Gamal Eid, the visit was postponed and eventually did not take
place.
In December 2015, the Egyptian Center for
the Right to Education was summoned by the Investigating Judge for questioning.
On February 4, 2016, Mr. Gamal Eid was
informed of a travel ban as he was attempting to travel outside Egypt. Mr. Hossam Bahgat, founder of EIPR, was
informed of a similar ban on February 23, 2016.
On March 13 and 14, 2016, two staff
members of CIHRS and three staff members of Nazra for Feminist Studies were
notified by telephone of a summons to appear on March 16 before the
Investigating Judge in Cairo within the framework of criminal case No.
173/2011. However, the two staff members of CIHRS refused to appear, as they
had not been properly notified in person in accordance with the law in force.
Two former staff members of the Andalus Institute for Tolerance and
Anti-Violence Studies and one accountant from the United Group were also
summoned within the same context.
On March 17, 2016, Messrs. Hossam Bahgat
and Gamal Eid were informed that the Investigative Judge had ordered the
freezing of their assets and that their case would be reviewed by the Cairo
Criminal Court in Zeinhom on March 24, 2016. The case was subsequently
adjourned to April 20, 2016, upon request from the Public Prosecutor.
On March 22, 2016, Ms. Mozn Hassan was formally accused of
receiving foreign funds without authorisation, and throughout the month of
March 2016, several NGO staff members were summoned to appear before the
Investigating Judge.
On April 19, 2016, Mr. Bahey eldin Hassan, CIHRS Director, two
staff members of CIHRS, as well as Mr. Moustafa
El Hassan, HMLC Director, were informed at 9pm through a phone call from
the Egyptian police that they were summoned to appear before the Cairo Criminal
Court in Zeinhom on April 20, along with Messrs. Bahgat and Eid.
On April 20, the Cairo Criminal Court in
Zeinhom added seven defendants from three additional NGOs to the “asset freeze
order” initially targeting Messrs. Hossam Bahgat and Gamal Eid.
The additional defendants were Mr. Bahey
eldin Hassan, Mr. Moustafa El Hassan, Mr. Abdel
Hafiz Tayel, Executive Director of
the Egyptian Center for the Right to Education, two staffmembers of CIHRS, as well as of Mr. Bahey eldin Hassan's wife and
daughter and Mr. Gamal Eid's wife and daughter6.
The hearing by the Cairo Criminal Court in
Zeinhom regarding the asset freeze order was postponed several times by the
prosecutors to review the evidence and formally summon the
Addresses:new defendants. It was adjourned to May
23, 2016, July 17, 2016, August 15, 2016 and September 17, 2016.
On May 27, Mr. Mohamed Zaree, CIHRS Egypt
Director, was informed by the authorities at Cairo International Airport that a
travel ban had been imposed on him based on an order by an investigative judge.
We believe this travel ban was ordered within the framework of the “foreign
funding case against NGOs”.
On June 27, 2016 Ms. Mozn Hassan was
informed by authorities at the Cairo International Airport that a travel ban
had been imposed on her, under the framework of the “NGO Foreign Funding Case” 7. Ms. Mozn Hassan had attempted to travel to participate in the
Executive Committee meeting of the Women Human Right Defenders (WHRD) Regional
Coalition for the Middle East and North Africa, taking place during the period
of June 27 to July 1, 2016.
On September 17, 2016, the Cairo Criminal
Court in Zeinhom ordered the freezing of the assets of Messrs. Gamal Eid, Director of ANHRI, Hossam Bahgat, founder of EIPR, Abdel Hafiz Tayel, Executive Director of CRE, Moustafa El Hassan, Director of HMLC, and Bahey Eldin Hassan, Director of the CIHRS, as well as those of three
human rights NGOs, the CRE, the CIHRS and the HMLC. The Court however refused to freeze the assets of somerelatives of the accused also targeted
by the asset freeze request.
In September 2016, Ms. Mozn Hassan and
Nazra received the “Right Livelihood” Award 2016, a prize known as the
Alternative Nobel Prize, for their activities in defence of women’s human
rights.
On December 12, 2016, during a court
hearing regarding the freezing of assets belonging to human rights lawyer Ms. Azza Soliman8, confirmed in an hearing on December 149, the investigative judge requested the North Cairo Court to freeze the
assets of Ms. Mozn Hassan, Founder and Executive Director
of Nazra for Feminist Studies, Mr.
Mohamed Zarea, head of Arab Penal Reform Organization (APRO), as well as
the assets of the twoorganisations.
The court adjourned the session until January 11, 2017.
On January 11, 2017, a Court decided to
freeze the assets of Ms. Mozn Hassan, Founder and Executive Director of Nazra
for Feminist Studies (Nazra), Mr. Mohamed Zarea, Director of the Arab Penal
Reform Organization (APRO), Mr. Atef
Hafez, former legal researcher at APRO as well as those held by the two
afore-mentioned organisations.
