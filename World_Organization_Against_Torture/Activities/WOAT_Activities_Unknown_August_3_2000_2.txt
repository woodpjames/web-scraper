According to the information received, the three victims were Congolese refugees from Lufugu who went to Kigoma to find products to sell.  The met with policemen in Mwandiga, a suburb 2km from Kigoma, who demanded the goods they were carrying.  Having refused to satisfy the policemen, two of the refugees were shot on the spot.  The third, a women, was shot as she tried to escape.  Only the next day at 5pm were the bodies buried by the military and the local population.
