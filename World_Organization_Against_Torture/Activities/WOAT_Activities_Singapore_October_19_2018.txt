The Observatory for the Protection of
Human Rights Defenders, a partnership of FIDH and the World Organisation
Against Torture (OMCT), has received information and requests your urgent
intervention in the following situation in Singapore.
 
Description
of the situation:
 
The Observatory has been
informed by reliable sources about the judicial harassment and conviction of
Mr. Jolovan Wham, social worker, human rights advocate, and former
Executive Director of the NGO Humanitarian Organisation for Migration Economics
(HOME)[1]. 
 
According to the
information received, on October 9, 2018, the Singapore High Court found Mr.
Jolovan Wham guilty of violating Article 3 (1) (a) of the 2016 Administration
of Justice (Protection) Act (“scandalising the court”). Mr. Jolovan Wham’s
prosecution and conviction stemmed from one of his Facebook posts published on
April 27, 2018, in which he shared a news story about a constitutional
challenge against Malaysia’s Anti-Fake News Act and commented that Malaysian
judges were “more independent than Singapore’s for cases with political
implication”. The Attorney-General Chambers (AGC) reasoned that the post “did
not constitute fair criticism of the court” and that it “posed a risk
that public confidence in the administration of justice would be undermined”.
Mr. Jolovan Wham’s sentencing hearing has been set for November 7, 2018. He
faces up to three years in jail or a fine of S$100,000 (around 62,740 Euros),
or both.
 
This is the first
conviction for “scandalising the court” under the 2016 Administration of
Justice (Protection) Act, which came into effect on October 1, 2017. This crime
is defined as “Any person who scandalises the court by intentionally
publishing any matter or doing any act that —(i) imputes improper motives
to or impugns the integrity, propriety or impartiality of any court;
and (ii) poses a risk that public confidence in the administration of
justice would be undermined”.
 
The Observatory condemns the conviction and
the judicial harassment against Mr. Jolovan Wham, which seem to be only aimed
at punishing him for his legitimate human rights activities and for the
exercise of his right to freedom of opinion and expression. The Observatory
calls on the authorities of Singapore to put an immediate end to the judicial
harassment against Mr. Jolovan Wham.
 
The Observatory recalls
that this is not the first act of judicial harassment against Mr. Jolovan Wham
On November 29, 2017, the State Court charged Mr. Jolovan Wham with “organising
public assemblies without a permit” (under the Public Order Act), “vandalism”
(under then Vandalism Act) and “refusing to sign statement” (under Article 180
of the Criminal Code). These charges were related to three peaceful gatherings
held between November 2016 and July 2017[2].  The prosecution of Mr. Jolovan Wham in
connection with this case is ongoing.
 
Actions requested:
 
Please write to the
authorities of Singapore asking them to:
 
i. Guarantee in
all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Jolovan
Wham and all human rights defenders in Singapore;
 
ii. Put an end to all acts
of harassment, including at the judicial level, against Mr. Jolovan
Wham and all human rights defenders in Singapore, and ensure that they are able
to carry out their activities without hindrance;
 
iii. Conform to the
provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the
General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially Articles
1, 6(c), and 12.2; and
 
iv. Ensure in all
circumstances the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in
accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
