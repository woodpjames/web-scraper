Brief description of the situation: The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Greek Helsinki Monitor (GHM), a member of OMCT SOS-Torture network, about new developments in the acts of harassment against GHM and activists who filed criminal actions against Greece’s neo-Nazis. According to the information received, on January 16, 2008, the Single-Member First Instance Court of Athens (Interim Measures) rejected the application lodged by Mr. Kostas Plevris, requesting interim measure to freeze the assets of Ms. Andrea Gilbert, GHM specialist on anti-Semitism. Ms. Gilbert had testified at a trial against extreme-right newspaper Eleftheros Kosmos, which had published articles on October 27, 2006 in conjunction of the anti-Semitic book by Mr. Plevris, The Jews - The whole truth (May 2006)[1]. In its ruling, the Court concluded that “it is true that the applicant calls into question the Holocaust, the concentration camps, the gas chambers and the ovens, which he considers part of Jewish propaganda […]”. Nevertheless, the criminal complaint for defamation and perjury lodged by Mr. Plevris against Ms. Andrea Gilbert, as well as against Mr. Panayote Dimitras, GHM Spokesperson and a member of OMCT Assembly of Delegates, and Messrs. Moses Konstantinis, Benjamin Albala, Abraham Reitan and Leon Gavriilidis, four members of the Central Board of Jewish Communities in Greece (Kentriko Israilitiko Symvoulio - KIS), who had all testified against him, is still in the phase of preliminary investigation: on January 17, 2008, the Prosecutor in charge sent it again to the magistrate to complement the investigation. Furthermore, regarding the second complaint lodged by Mr. Plevris against GHM and other NGOs, claiming that they are “redundant and illegal”, and implying they are “foreign agents”, the Prosecutor in charge launched an ex officio preliminary investigation only against GHM. In a first statement on September 26, 2007, Mr. Dimitras had called the investigation abusive as, inter alia, it did not specify the alleged criminal activities Then, on February 21, 2008, the Prosecutor sent again the file, this time mentioning one legal provision for the investigation: Article 4 of the European Convention on the Recognition of the Legal Personality of International Non-Governmental Organisations, which states that “In each party the application of this Convention may only be excluded if the NGO invoking this Convention, by its object, its purpose or the activity which it actually exercises: a) contravenes national security, public safety, or is detrimental to the prevention of disorder or crime, the protection of health or morals, or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others; or b) jeopardises relations with another State or the maintenance of international peace and security”. This intervened just after GHM won its sixth case in nine months at the European Court of Human Rights - ECtHR (violation of religious freedom with the religious oath before the courts - four previous cases concerned police violence and one excessive length of proceedings). As Mr. Dimitras noted in his March 6, 2008 statement to the magistrate, this provision or the related law does not include any sentence so as to be investigated during a criminal procedure, but may be used for a possible withdrawal of the recognition of GHM in a civil procedure. No real or alleged GHM action was listed by the Prosecutor that could have been the basis of the investigation. On the contrary, the Prosecutor asked for information of the administrative and financial functioning of GHM, including its income. Such questions were included in Mr. Plevris’ complaint that triggered the investigation. In his statement, Mr. Dimitras filed for the exemption of the Prosecutor from the investigation for his partiality as he recalled that the same Prosecutor had filed two GHM complaints in the past in a manner that had led GHM then to challenge his impartiality. In one of them, the Prosecutor had shelved the investigation of GHM claims that there was an improper investigation into the death of Mr. Gentjan Celnku in 2001: in July 2007, the ECtHR convicted Greece for the violation of Article 2 of ECHR both in its substantive and in its procedural limb, finding that “there was no effective investigation into the fatal shooting”. The International Secretariat of OMCT expresses its deep concern about this judicial harassment against GHM and its members, which seems to merely aim at sanctioning their human rights activities, in particular their activities against discrimination and anti-Semitism in Greece. The International Secretariat of OMCT also recalls that according to Article 12.2 of the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 9, 1998, “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”.  Background information: On December 13, 2007, Second Three-Member Appeals Court of Athens convicted Mr. Plevris to a suspended prison sentence of 14 months for “incitation to racial violence and hatred and for racial insults”. The other three defendants - the publisher, editor, and journalist of Eleftheros Kosmo - were acquitted of the same charges. Mr. Plevris appealed and the resulting trial is expected to be held in 2008. Subsequent to the end of the trial, Mr. Plevris launched a series of legal actions for defamation against Mr. Dimitras, as well as against Ms. Andrea Gilbert and Messrs. Moses Konstantinis, Benjamin Albala, Abraham Reitan and Leon Gavriilidis, who had testified against him. Although these lawsuits contain racist, anti-Semitic and homophobic statements, the Greek courts have surprisingly registered them and have set trial dates in 2008. Besides, Mr. Plevris also filed a complaint against GHM and NGOs in general claiming they are redundant, illegal and implying they are foreign agents. His complaints include again racist and defamatory comments. Nevertheless, the Chief Prosecutor of the First Instance Court of Athens and in one case the Chief Prosecutor of the Appeals Misdemeanors Court of Athens have decided that these criminal complaints were not completely unfounded, and launched preliminary criminal investigations. Finally, Mr. Plevris collected all these legal documents and published them in a second book entitled The Struggle for Truth, which is again anti-Semitic and racist, but also defamatory for the GHM and KIS activists and Eleftherotypia journalists. In addition, as the legal documents are published in full, the addresses of those he sued are also printed.
