Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned by continuing information received regarding the torture of persons in detention and that those being tried appear to have no guarantee of their procedural rights.  OMCT has been informed by the Bahrain Human Rights Organisation (BHRO), member of the OMCT network, of the detention and ill-treatment of a number of persons.  Mohammed Hassan Mohammed Jawad, 52 years old, was detained last year.  News from inside the jail confirmed that Mr. Jawad had been transferred to solitary confinement where he has been held for more than 50 days.  OMCT is gravely concerned for his physical and psychological integrity.  The International Secretariat was also informed that the condition of Naji Ahmed Salman, an 18-year old boy from Kawarah, has deteriorated.  He was detained on 5 January 1997 and was placed in administrative detention (in the Dry-Dock prison camp).  He was transferred to Salmanya Hospital on 31 March 2000 suffering due to the torture he had undergone.  Naji was arrested at the age of 15.  In addition, the International Secretariat has received information from BHRO that security forces attacked the house of Haji Hassan Rashid in Karzakkan, where they terrorised and ill-treated all members of the family.  It is reported that foreign-staffed security forces entered the house at 3 :30 am and later claimed that they had been searching for a group of youths who carried posters of the martyr Fadil Abbas Marhhon.  A unit belonging to the Bahrain Defence Force (who have a base nearby) killed Mr. Marhoon on 6 May 1996.  None of the killers have as yet been brought to justice.   Also, Nidhal Ismail Mahdi, 18 years old, was reportedly taken from his home on 24th April 2000 and detained.   Elsewhere, the International Secretariat is gravely concerned for the physical and psychological integrity of a number of Bahraini citizens, previously arrested in 1998 and allegedly subjected to torture and sentenced on 3rd May 2000 by the Security Council, to fines and sentences of between 2 and 7 years, under allegations of sabotage and terrorism.  According to BHRO the sentencing apparently took a few minutes: Ali Mahdi Ahmed Yousef, 22 years old, received 7 years imprisonment and a fine of BD 500 ($1350); Aqil Al Jaziri, 22, in absentia, received 7 years imprisonment and a fine of BD 500 ($1350); Saeed Al Sheikh, 33, received 5 years imprisonment and a fine of BD 500 ($1350); Hesham Ali Hassan Ahmed, 18, received 2 years imprisonment and a fine of BD 200 ($540).  Action requested  Please write to the authorities in Bahrain urging them to:  i.	take all necessary measures to guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of the above-mentioned persons and order their immediate release, in the absence of valid charges; ii.	review the sentences of the latter four persons by a civil court, guarantee their procedural rights and guarantee an immediate impartial investigation into all allegations of torture; iii.	put an immediate end to the use of arbitrary detention of  people by the police and abrogate 1974 State Security Law and all national laws which are not in compliance with international human rights standards; iv.	guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
