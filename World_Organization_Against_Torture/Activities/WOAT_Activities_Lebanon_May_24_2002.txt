Brief description of the facts  Following a letter to the President of the Republic dated 16/05/02 concerning the disappearance of Mr. Ramzi Irani, remaining without response till this day, the International Secretariat of OMCT was informed by credible sources of the death of Mr. Ramzi Irani, an engineer working for Total and an activist for the Lebanese Forces (Forces Libanaises, FL).  On Tuesday 7 May, at 16:30, Mr. Irani disappeared while he was leaving his office in the neighborhood of Hamra in Beirut.  No news about his situation had been sent to us by 20th May, the date in which his body was found in the trunk of his car, parked in Beirut. According to preliminary information, he had been dead for several days.  The political group to which Mr. Ramzi Irani belonged had been persecuted in the past. Without reaching hasty conclusions concerning this complex affair, the World Organization Against Torture (Organisation mondiale contre la torture, OMCT), nevertheless insists that an investigation into the case be launched so that light can be shed upon the death of Mr. Irani.  Actions requested  We request you kindly to write to the authorities in the Republic of Lebanon, urging them to:  ·	order an immediate, thorough and impartial investigation into the above-mentioned cases in order to identify those responsible, bring them to trial and apply the penal, civil and or administrative sanctions as provided by law;   ·	guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
