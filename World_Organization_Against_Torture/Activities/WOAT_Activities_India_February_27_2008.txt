He was allegedly confined during his detention in an isolated dark room, blindfolded, beaten and threatened at gunpoint to admit to be a member of an armed opposition group, which he reportedly repeatedly denied. He was also allegedly threatened to death not to disclose any information about his detention and to report that he had been arrested by the Myanmar Army. The International Secretariat of OMCT welcomes the release of Mr. Abi Chiru but remains gravely concerns for his physical and psychological integrity, in particular following the alleged death threats not to disclose any information. OMCT recalls to India that according to article 7 and 9 1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) to which it is a State party, no one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and no one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest or detention. OMCT calls on the authorities to order a thorough and impartial investigation into these events, in order to identify those responsible, bring them to trial and apply the penal and/or administrative sanctions as provided by law. Further, as an elected member of the United Nations Human Rights Council, India should particularly guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
