Brief description:  The Observatory was informed by the Sudanese Organisation Against Torture (SOAT) of the arrest, on May 5, 2004, in Zalingy, of Mr. Osman Adam Abdel Mawla, 39, a human rights activist and a member of the Sudan Social Development Organisation (SUDO), Nyala branch.  According to the information received, Mr. Osman Adam Abdel Mawla is currently being detained in the security forces offices in Zalingy with no official charges against him. There are serious concerns that he may be subjected of torture as there have been several reports of torture by the security forces in Zalingy.  The Observatory fears that these events are linked with Mr. Abdel Mawla’s human rights activities within SUDO, a voluntary organisation created to promote sustainable development and human rights. SUDO, has been particularly active in Darfur carrying out various workshops on human rights and has provided assistance to internally displaced people (IDP's) in Darfur.  In this regard, the Observatory recalls that Mr. Madawi Ibrahim Adam, 47, Chairperson of SUDO, remains in detention since his arrest on 28 December 2003 by the National Security Agency (NSA). He was arrested at his house, in Omdurman, which was searched and allegedly damaged. He was transferred to Kober prison on 3 January 2004. (see Urgent Appeal SDN 001/0104/OBS 001, January 6th, 2004). The Observatory also recalls that Hussein Ibrahim Gindeel, the executive director of SUDO, had been held incommunicado from 24 to 27 March 2003, in relation with a workshop he was due to lead on 26 and 27 March in Damazin, dedicated to the role of civil society in the peace process (See annual report 2003).  The Observatory is very concerned by Mr. Abdel Mawla’s arrest and detention and fears for his physical and psychological integrity.  Actions requested:  Please write to the Sudanese authorities and ask them to:  i.	Ensure in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Osman Adam Abdel Mawla; ii.	Order the immediate release Osman Adam Abdel Mawla and Madawi Ibrahim Adam in the absence of valid legal charges against them, or if legitimate charges exist, bring them before an impartial tribunal in the soonest delay and guarantee their right to a fair and impartial trial;  iii.	Put an end to any kind of harassment against SUDO’s members and all human rights defenders in Sudan; iv.	conform to the provisions of the Declaration on Humans Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, in particular article 1, which states that "everyone has the right, individually or in association with others, to promote the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels"; article 12.2 which provides that "the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually or in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto o de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration."; v.	ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards.
