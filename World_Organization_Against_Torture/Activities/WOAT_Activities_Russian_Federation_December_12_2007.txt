Brief description of the situation The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by a reliable source of the alleged forced psychiatric internment of Mr. Artyom Basyrov, a 30-year-old student of the History Faculty of the Pedagogical Institute and reportedly actively involved in the activities of « The Other Russia » as a press person of the coalition in Mary El Republic (administrative entity within the Russian Federation), on 23 November 2007, in Joshkar Ola (approximately 750 km from Moscow). According to the information received, on 23 November 2007, at around 01:30 p.m., two young men in civilian clothes stopped Mr. Artyom Basyrov on his way home. They reportedly asked him whether he was registered on the books of the psychoneurological centre what he would have confirmed. Mr. Artyom Basyrov reportedly faced a depression one year and half ago and was recommended to undergo medical treatment in that psychoneurological centre. They then allegedly put him immediately into their car and drove him to the town psychoneurological centre without showing any documents or IDs. According to the same information, the administration of the hospital is denying any family’s visits and refuses to give any information as to the reasons of Mr. Artyom Basyrov’s detention in the hospital. According to his relatives, authorities have no grounds to put him in the hospital by force. Furthermore, his relatives were reportedly not informed about his detention and enforced treatment. Mr. Artyom Basyrov reportedly managed to reach his brother once at the centre but was then transferred to a specialised clinic located outside the town. A medical commission was reportedly held on 26 November 2007, while it should have been held within 48 hours. The commission allegedly decided that Mr. Artyom Basyrov would have to be subjected to enforced treatment due to symptoms that would be developing. The court session reportedly upheld this decision on 27 November 2007.  On 6 December 2007, Mr. Artyom Basyrov’s lawyer reportedly managed to visit him at the hospital. Mr. Artyom Basyrov reportedly strongly objected being held in the hospital and was already under strong medication. His lawyer tried to inquire with the chief of the hospital department why Mr. Artyom Basyrov’s brother is being denied access and informed the doctor of the intention to appeal his enforced treatment. Apparently, the doctor would have said that he “expressed doubts that the lawyer would manage to change the course of things”. According to the doctor, the only reason why his brother could not see Mr. Artyom Basyrov is because he would still be in the admission department of the hospital and that his situation would be currently reviewed. He reportedly informed that Mr. Artyom Basyrov’s brother would be allowed to meet with him after his transfer to the main department.  Mr. Artyom Basyrov’s lawyer has reportedly appealed the court ruling upholding Mr. Artyom Basyrov’s enforced treatment before the Supreme Court of the Republic of Mary El but the date of the hearing has not been fixed yet. They are fears that the forced psychiatric interment of Mr. Artyom Basyrov is politically motivated. According to the same information, on 14 November 2007, along with another “The Other Russia” supporter, Mr. Mikhail Kluzhev, they sent a notification to the city administration to hold a march of the dissent in Joshkar Ola[1]. The following day, they reportedly received a negative response from the administration. They would also have received an official warning signed by the Chief of the Ministry of the Interior, Mr. Morozov, not to hold illegal rallies in Joshkar Ola on 24 November 2007 after which they decided not to hold the march. According to the same information, on 22 November 2007, Mr. Mikhail Kluzhev was assaulted when he was coming home from work. The assaulters reportedly vanished but the police allegedly turned up immediately and detained Mr. Mikhail Kluzhev. He was then reportedly sentenced to three days administrative detention. The international Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned for the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Artyom Basyrov and about his forced psychiatric internment as it seems politically motivated. OMCT calls on the authorities to immediately release him and order a prompt, thorough and impartial investigation into these events. Action requested Please write to the authorities in Russia urging them to:  Guarantee, in all circumstances, the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Artyom Basyrov; Order his immediate release; Order a thorough and impartial investigation into these events, in order to identify all those responsible, bring them to trial and apply the civil, penal and/or administrative sanctions as provided by law; Guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
