New information: The Observatory has been informed by Human Rights in China (HRIC) that Mr. Yang Maodong, alias Guo Feixiong, a legal adviser with the Beijing-based Shengzhi Law Office, has been subjected to torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment while in detention. According to the information received, during a prison visit on January 11, 2007, Mr. Guo told his lawyer that he had been handcuffed and shackled to his bed for more than 40 days. Mr. Guo further said that he was deprived of sleep for days and subjected to around-the-clock interrogation. He would have been on hunger strike for 25 days in protest. Moreover, since the beginning of his detention, Mr. Guo has reportedly been interrogated nearly one hundred times since he was detained on September 14, 2006, on suspicion of “illegal business activity”. Furthermore, on January 13, 2007, Mr. Guo’s sister was told by a police officer from the Public Security Bureau (PSB) of Shiyan City, Hubei Province, that she should “psychologically prepare” herself for the likelihood that Mr. Guo would be sentenced to five to eight years in prison. On the same day, Mr. Guo’s brother, in Hubei’s Xiangfan City, reportedly received a phone call from the local PSB saying that Mr. Guo’s case was being transferred to Liaoning Province. When Mr. Guo’s lawyer checked this information with the Prosecutor’s office in Guangzhou, the official responsible for Mr. Guo’s case refuted it. The Observatory believes that Mr. Guo’s detention is connected to his involvement in defending the rights of the Taishi villagers, in the framework of their struggle against the corruption of  Mr. Chen Jinsheng, the elected chief of the village committee suspected of corruption. Indeed, in July 2005, Mr. Guo started to give legal assistance to villagers in Taishi, who were trying to obtain the dismissal of Mr. Chen Jinsheng. Following the government’s refusal to accept their requests, the villagers staged sit-ins and hunger strikes. Since mid-September 2005, the local government decided to take coercive measures against the demonstrations: dozens of villagers were arrested and many got injured. Mr. Guo posted on-line comments about these events. Background information: On September 13, 2005, Mr. Guo Feixiong, who provided legal advice in a number of controversial right defence cases, was arrested in Guangzhou and held incommunicado until October 4, 2005. He was released without charge on December 27, 2005. Following his release, Mr. Guo was beaten by public security officers on three occasions in February, March and August of 2006. On February 3, 2006 Mr. Guo Feixiong was detained in the Linhe police station in Guangzhou for 12 hours. He was subsequently released on February 4, 2006. Before he left the building, he was dragged out  by a group of unidentified men who beat him violently and took the film. They reportedly twisted his arms and kicked his lower back in front of some policemen who did nothing to defend him. On February 8, 2006, Mr. Guo Feixiong issued an open letter addressed to the Chinese President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao. In the letter, he protested against the excessive use of force in government crackdowns on recent demonstrations and civil society movements in rural areas, forced evictions, violence against a widening circle of human rights lawyers which appear to be sanctioned by the authorities, and tightening of media censorship. He also requested the authorities to engage in dialogue with villagers in order to avoid escalation of rural land disputes, and to guarantee local democracy, press freedom and protection of human rights defenders. On the same day, he was detained for 26 hours in the Fuyou police station in Beijing. The next day, he was escorted back home by three policemen. Since then, his house was being watched by the police and he was being followed by policemen. On September 14, 2006, Mr. Guo Feixiong was detained, before being formally arrested on September 30, 2006 on suspicion of “illegal business activity”. On October 19, 2006, the Guangzhou PSB referred the case to the Guangzhou Municipal Prosecutor, who sent the case back to the PSB on October 28 for further investigation. At the time of his detention, the police searched his home and seized computers, a cellular telephone, digital video and audio tapes, and a number of books and documents. Mr. Guo’s wife was also detained for questioning and subjected to repeated body searches, and police continued to monitor her following her release. On September 29, 2006, Mr. Guo’s lawyers were allowed to visit him at the Guangzhou Municipal Detention Centre. Mr. Guo told them about his very bad conditions of detention and that, despite he wrote several letters of complaint to the Prosecutor, detention centre officials refused to deliver them. On January 6, 2007, Mr. Guo’s wife received a letter from him in prison stating that on December 28, 2006, the Prosecutor had informed him that it had received a “statement of investigation” from the PSB, which content has not been communicated. Actions required: Please write to the Chinese authorities urging them to:  Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Guo Feixiong; Ensure his immediate release, as his detention is arbitrary; Put an end to all acts of harassment against them as well as all other human rights defenders in China; Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, article 6(b), which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others (...) to publish, impart or disseminate to others views, information and knowledge on all human rights and fundamental freedoms”, and its article 8(2), which provides that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to submit to governmental bodies and agencies and organisations concerned with public affairs criticism and proposals for improving their functioning and to draw attention to any aspect of their work that may hinder or impede the promotion, protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms”; Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by the People’s Republic of China.
