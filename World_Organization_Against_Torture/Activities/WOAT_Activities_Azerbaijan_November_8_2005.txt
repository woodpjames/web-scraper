New InformationThe International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Human Rights Centre of Azerbaijan, a member of the OMCT network, that Mr. Eldar Salayev, 72 years old, professor and full member of the Acadamey of Science of Azerbaijan, arrested on 27th October 2005, has been accused of preparing the return of Mr. Rasul Quliyev to Azerbaijan.   Mr. Rasul Guliyev, leader of the Democratic Party of Azerbaijan, has been accused of embezzlement, charges which seem to be politically motivated. Mr. Guliyev has been living in the United States for several years and declared that he would return to Azerbaijan to run in the presidential elections. The prosecutor-general had said that he would be immediately arrested and jailed if he returned to Azerbaijan. (see related Case AZE 081105)  A member of the Human Rights Centre in Azerbaijan was able to visit Mr. Salayev, who appeared to be in good health, apart from his eyes, and that his cell was ok.  However, OMCT is gravely concerned by the fact that Mr. Salayev is being held in the prison of the Ministry of National Security which the United Nations Committee against Torture recommended be closed or transferred to the authority of the Ministry of Justice, in 2003. Brief Reminder of the SituationThe International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned for the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Salayev who is blind in one eye and partially blind in the second, and who was reportedly interrogated for nearly 12 hours on October 27th.
