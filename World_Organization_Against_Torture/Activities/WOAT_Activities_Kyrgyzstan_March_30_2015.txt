The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of
the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation
Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent intervention in the following
situation in Kyrgyzstan.
Description
of the situation:
The Observatory was
informed by reliable sources about the search undertaken in the offices of the
Osh chapter of Bir Duino and at the place of residence of two prominent human
rights lawyers, which resulted in the confiscation of a number of documents on
human rights issues.
According to the
information received, on March 27, 2015 at 4.20 pm, officers from the Osh
Office of the State Committee of National Security (SCNS) came into the
premises of the Osh office of Bir Duino, on the basis of a court decision
issued on March 26 by the judge of the Osh City Court, Mr. K. M. Matisakov,
under Article 13 of the Penal Code (“countering extremism activity by
confiscating forbidden material of religious character”).
On that occasion, the
officers from the SCNS seized computers, material related to criminal cases and
USB drives containing working documents on human rights issues. Four staff
members were in the Bir Duino office at that moment of the facts. Subsequently,
a number of colleagues, partners, human rights lawyers, as well as a
representative of the Ombudsman office of the Osh region and a member of
Parliament, Ms. Alnura Altinaeva, came on the spot, but were denied access to
the premises.
SCNS officers also
searched and seized material at the place of residence of two high profile
lawyers, Mr. Valerian Vakhitov and Mr. Khusanbay Saliev, both
members of the Osh office of Bir Duino, who have been working on the violations
committed during the Osh events in June 2010, and notably on the case of human
rights defender Azimjan Askarov, a well-known ethnic Uzbek defender and
Director of the human rights organisation “Vozdukh” (Air), who was found guilty
of killing a policeman during violent clashes between Kyrgyz and Uzbeks in the
south of Kyrgyzstan, following an unfair and politically motivated trial.
During those searches, books and USB drives were notably seized.
The Observatory
firmly denounces the above-mentioned searches and confiscations, which were
carried out on the basis of an illegal judicial decision. Article 13 of the
Criminal Code indeed provides for a clear procedure before material of
so-called “extremist” character can be seized: the Prosecutor must send a
request to the judge, who must in turn convey the request to the Ministry of
Justice. If the Ministry of Justice considers that the material in question can
have an “extremist” character, it must publish the list of the documents in
question, before the latter can be seized. In the present case, non of these
procedures were respected. The Observatory is all the more concerned that the
seizure of material at the place of residence of Messrs. Vakhitov and Saliev
violates another piece of Kyrgyz legislation guaranteeing the immunity of
professional documents of lawyers.
Such acts of
harassment took place as Kyrgyz President Atambaev is achieving a trip in
Europe, where he met notably with European Union representatives and with
French President François Hollande[1].
The Observatory
recalls finally that it is not the first time that Bir Duino and its
representatives are facing harassment. In December 2013, unknown perpetrators
had broken into the Biskek office of Bir Duino in Bishkek and stolen some money
as well as the video surveillance camera and five laptops that contained a lot
of key data of the organisation. Back in July 2013, unknown perpetrators had
already broken into Bir Duino second Bishkek office on Juvenal Justice, and
stolen two computers and data on human rights issues[2].
Bir Duino staff members and Director, Ms. Tolekan Ismailova, have also
been judicially harassed and slandered on several occasions[3].
The Observatory calls
on the authorities to put an end to any act of harassment, including at the
judicial level, against Messrs. Valerian Vakhitov and Khusanbay Saliev as well
as against all human rights defenders in Kyrgyzstan, and to conform in all
circumstances with the Kyrgyz Constitution as well as with international
obligations of Kyrgyzstan, including the United Nations Declaration on Human
Rights Defenders.
Actions
requested :
 i.
Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Messrs.
Valerian Vakhitov and Khusanbay Saliev and of all human rights defenders in
Kyrgyzstan;
ii.
Immediately and unconditionally return the confiscated equipment and material
to their owners, and notably to Messrs. Valerian Vakhitov and Khusanbay Saliev;
iii.
Put an end to all acts of harassment, including at the judicial level, against
all human rights defenders in Kyrgyzstan;
iv.
Comply with all the provisions of the United Nations Declaration on Human
Rights Defenders, in particular with:
-
its Article 1, which provides that “everyone has the right, individually and in
association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and
realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and
international levels”;
-
its Article 5 (a): “For the purpose of promoting and protecting human rights
and fundamental freedoms, everyone has the right, individually and in
association with others, at the national and international levels (a) To meet
or assemble peacefully”;
v.
Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms
in accordance with international human rights standards and international
instruments ratified by Kyrgyzstan.
