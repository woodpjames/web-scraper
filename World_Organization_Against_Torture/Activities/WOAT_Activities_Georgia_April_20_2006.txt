New information:The Observatory has been informed by the Human Rights Centre of Azerbaijan (HRCA) of the release on bail, on April 14, 2006, of Mr. Azer Samedov, president of the Caucasus Centre for Protection of Conscience and Religious Persuasion Freedom (CCPCRPF) in Georgia, and an Azerbaijani citizen emigrated to Georgia after the troubles provoked by the presidential elections results in October 2003.  However, Mr. Azer Samedov remains accused of “participation in mass disorders” (article 220 of the Criminal Code) and “resistance to the representatives of authorities” (article 315), relating to the troubles occurred in October 2003 in Baku, after the announcement of the presidential elections results, and which he was actually monitoring.  The Observatory welcomes the release on bail of Mr. Samedov and thanks all the persons, organisations and institutions who intervened in favour of this decision. Nevertheless, the Observatory strongly expresses its deepest concern regarding the arbitrary charges pronounced against Mr. Samedov and the extradition procedure initiated against him, as he may face serious risks of unfair trial and ill-treatment in Azerbaijan. Background information:On March 31, 2006, Mr. Samedov was arrested in Tbilisi, Georgia, by officers of the Anti-terrorist Centre of the Ministry of Interior, on the request of the Anti-terrorist Service of the Ministry of National Security of Azerbaijan. On April 2, 2006, the Tbilisi City Court had approved his detention at the Investigating Prison n°5 of Tbilisi, until the end of the extradition procedure to Azerbaijan initiated against him. Action requested:Please write to the authorities of Georgia urging them to: i. Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Azer Samedov;  ii. Drop the charges against Mr. Azer Samedov as they are arbitrary, and put an immediate end to the extradition procedure to Azerbaijan initiated against him;  iii. Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on December 9, 1998, especially its article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually or in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels” and article 12-2 which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection  by the competent authorities of everyone, individually or in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”;  iv. Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by Georgia.
