New InformationThe International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Human Rights Centre of Azerbaijan, a member of the OMCT network, that Mr. Ruslan Bashirli, chairman of the Youth Movement “Yeni Fikir” (New Idea), and Mr. Ramin Tagiyev, vice-chairman of Yeni Fikir are on hunger strike since 2 April 2006.   The trial against Mr. Ruslan Bashirli and Mr. Ramin Tagiyev started on 31 March 2006 in the Court of Grave Crimes. Judge Tofiq Pashayev decided to close the trial to the public on the basis of national security reasons. Responding to that, Mr. Bashirli and Mr. Tagiyev started their hunger strike.   The International Secretariat of OMCT did not receive further information concerning Mr. Said Nuri.  Brief reminder of the situationAccording to the information received, Mr. Ruslan Bashirli was arrested on August 3, 2005, on charges of “plotting to overthrow the Azerbaijani leadership at the instigation of Armenian intelligence agents”, with whom he allegedly met in Tbilisi on July 28 and 29, 2005. A criminal case under clause 278 of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Azerbaijan (“actions directed to seizing or keeping the power by force”) was brought against him by the Prosecutor’s Office of the Republic of Azerbaijan. If found guilty, he could face life imprisonment. Moreover, he was accused of “illegal entrepreneurship” (Art.192 of the Criminal Code). According to the article, the running of a business (entrepreneurship) without registration of license is punished by fine, limitation of liberty up to 3 years, or imprisonment up to 5 years. However, this should not apply to a non-profit organisation. Furthermore, Mr. Ruslan Bashirli’s family has been subjected to harassment. Mr. Ruslan Bashirli’s father, Mr. Djalil Bashirli, was forced to leave his position as a schoolteacher. Moreover, his house, located in Zardob, was attacked by a mob that threw stones at his house. Mr. Ruslan Bashirli’s uncle, Mr. Fuzuli Qasimov, senior tax inspector in the region of Goychay, was dismissed on August 8, 2005. Mr. Ruslan Bashirli was allegedly tortured which resulted in the deterioration of his health. Therefore he was transferred to the medical unit of the Bayil Prison, Baku city. However, according to his lawyer, the conditions of the medical unit did not permit adequate medical treatment.   On 12 September 2005, police arrested Mr. Said Nuri. He was temporarily detained in confinement at the Narimanov District Police Administration, where he was reportedly accused of “preparation of a coup d’état and getting financial support from interested forces”. The “evidence” was his participation in a seminar in Poland organised by the Institute of European Democracy. On the day after his arrest, Mr. Nuri was hospitalised because of a poor health condition (talassemia, and problems with his internal organs) in the City Clinical Hospital No. 1 in Baku. On 14 September 2005, it was reported that Mr. Nuri had received necessary treatment and was released. However, the next day, he was rearrested on his way to work, although the Prosecutor’s Office stated that he was “invited” by the investigator. On 14 November 2005, Mr. Said Nuri was released from hospital where he had been since 15 September 2005, and was placed under house arrest. At that time, the charges against him had not been dropped.  On 16 September 2005, the Nasimi district court of Baku approved the preliminary arrest of Mr. Ramin Tagiyev. He was detained in Bayil Prison (Investigation Isolator #1 of the Ministry of Justice), on suspicion of preparing the forced seizure of power under the same case as Mr. Ruslan Bashirli’s. Mr. Bashirli’s lawyer would have reported that he was kept in a very cold cell in isolation.  The trials for Mr. Bashirli, Mr. Nuri and Mr. Tagiyev were scheduled for 31 March 2006 in the Court of Grave Crimes under chairmanship of judge Tofiq Pasheyev. The bill of accusations against the three men includes Articles 278, 192.2.1 and 192.2.2 Criminal Code of the Republic of Azerbaijan (attempt of illegal seizure of power and illegal entrepreneurship).
