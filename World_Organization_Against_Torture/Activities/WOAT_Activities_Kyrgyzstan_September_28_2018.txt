The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a
partnership of FIDH and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), requests
your urgent intervention in the following situation in Kyrgyzstan.
 
Brief description of the situation:
 
The
Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the ongoing judicial harassment of
the human rights organisations Anti-Discrimination Centre "Memorial"
(ADC "Memorial")[1]
and Bir Duino Kyrgyzstan[2].

 
According to the information
received, on January 2017 an Oktyabrski District Court of Bishkek declared an
alternative report submitted to the United Nations Committee on the Rights of
Migrant Workers as “extremist material” and banned the activities of ADC
"Memorial" in Kyrgyzstan. The
Kyrgyz authorities did not notify either ADC "Memorial" or Bir Duino
Kyrgyzstan of the Court’s decision. Thus, the right of said human rights
organisations to defend themselves in court and to appeal the decision within
legally established deadlines was violated. The information about the court
ruling became known to human rights organisations accidentally in May 2018.
 
An
alternative report was submitted to the UN by ADC "Memorial" and Bir
Duino Kyrgyzstan  in 2015 for the 22th
session of the UN Committee on Migrant Workers. Following the Court’s decision,
the report which focuses on the violation of rights of Kyrgyz migrants in
Russia was placed on the “List of extremist materials”, as published in a
specific section of the website of the Ministry of Justice of Kyrgyzstan[3].
Under Kyrgyz law the diffusion of extremist materials entails criminal
penalties under Articles 1 and 13 of the Law “On counteracting extremist activities”.
 
In May 2018, during a visit to
Kyrgyzstan, the United Nations Assistant-Secretary General raised the question
with the Government[4]
and on June 25, 2018, the UN Committee on Migrant Workers addressed the
government of Kyrgyzstan to express its concerns regarding this decision. No
reaction is known to have followed from the government.
 
The
Observatory expresses its deep concern over the fact that human right reports,
including alternative reports submitted to the United Nations, may be qualified
as “extremist materials” by governments and that their authors may be banned
from entering the territory of the Kyrgyz Republic setting a dangerous
precedent for human rights defenders in the region. 
 
Furthermore,
the Observatory strongly condemns this unlawful judicial harassment of ADC
"Memorial" and Bir Duino Kyrgyzstan, both of which are member
organisations of FIDH. Accordingly, the Observatory calls on the Kyrgyz
authorities to remedy the violated rights of ADC "Memorial" and Bir
Duino Kyrgyzstan who are willing to appeal the Court decision. 
 
Actions requested:
 
Please write to the authorities of
Kyrgyzstan, urging them to:
 
i. Put
an end to all acts of harassment, including at the judicial level, used to
sanction the human rights work of ADC "Memorial", Bir Duino
Kyrgyzstan and all human rights defenders and human rights organisations in
Kyrgyzstan;
 
ii.
Declare the judicial decision adopted in January 2017
by the the Oktyabrski District Court unlawful, ensure remedy for the procedural
violation due to the lack of notification to the two organisations involved in
the case, lift the suspension of the activities of ADC "Memorial" in
Kyrgyzstan and take all necessary measures to
guarantee the freedom of activities of ADC "Memorial" in Kyrgyzstan;
 
iii. Ensure
that human rights reports, including those submitted to the UN as part of the
human rights mechanisms ratified by Kyrgyzstan, are not placed in the list of
extremist materials;
 
iv. Comply with all the
provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the
United Nations General Assembly on December 9, 1998, in particular with its
Articles 1, 5(c) and 12.2; 
 
v. Ensure in all circumstances
respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with
international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by
Kyrgyzstan.
