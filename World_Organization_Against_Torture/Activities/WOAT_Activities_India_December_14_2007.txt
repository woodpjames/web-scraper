A number of victims, including children, women and elderly persons, were physically ill-treated and subjected to violence, and homes and belongings were destroyed. Furthermore, international standards on  evictions were not met: the evictees were not properly informed and were offered neither compensation nor alternative housing.     OMCT recalls that “As recognized by several human rights bodies, forced evictions constitute prima facie violations of a wide range of internationally recognized human rights and can only be carried out under exceptional circumstances and in full accordance with international human rights law.”  Moreover, forced evictions intensify inequality, social conflict, segregation and  “ghettoization”, and OMCT expresses its concern that the systematic use of forced evictions by the State Government of West Bengal has had serious implications for the most socially and economically vulnerable sectors of society.
