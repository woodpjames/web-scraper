The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in The Philippines.
 
Description of the situation:
 
The Observatory has been informed by the Alliance for the Advancement of People’s Rights (KARAPATAN) of the killing of Mr. Bonifacio Labasan, vice-chairperson of the Isabela chapter of the Union of Peasants in Cagayan Valley (Danggayan Dagiti Mannalon iti Cagayan Valley - DAGAMI), engaged in a campaign against the conversion of vast crop lands for the production of bio-ethanol, which would displace farmers from their lands in Isabela Province.
 
According to the information received, on March 9, 2011 at 10:30 a.m., Mr. Bonifacio Labasan and his daughter were riding on a motorcycle on the way to Baranggay Victoria, Municipality of San Mateo, in the Isabela Province. While on the road, they noticed that two men riding in tandem on a motorcycle were following them. When Mr. Bonifacio Labasan and his daughter arrived to Baranggay San Roque, the two men forced them to stop.
 
One of the two men approached Mr. Bonifacio Labasan and ordered him to come with them. As Mr. Bonifacio Labasan refused, the man pointed a gun at him and shot him on his right side. When Mr. Bonifacio Labasan fell, the man shot him in the head causing his dead. The two men immediately left on their motorcycle.
 
After almost an hour, two policemen arrived to the scene. They interviewed Mr. Bonifacio Labasan’s daughter and accompanied her back home. 
 
According to the information received, a complaint has been lodged at the local police. It has been reported that the police is still studying the filing of charges. No one has been detained at the time of issuing this appeal.
 
Within the DAGAMI's campaign launched last year against the bio-ethanol project in Isabela, Mr. Bonifacio Labasan was involved in dialogues between the Government and farmers. He also participated in protest actions on the rights of the peasants and helped in the dissemination of DAGAMI’s campaign and other farmers’ ongoing issues in their community and province.
 
The Observatory strongly condemns the killing of Mr. Bonifacio Labasan, which seems to merely aim at sanctioning his human rights activities, in particular his defence of the peasants’ rights to their lands. The Observatory urges the Philippines authorities to order a thorough, impartial and transparent investigation into his assassination, in order to identify all those responsible, bring them before a civil competent and impartial tribunal and apply to them the penal sanctions provided by the law. The Observatory further urges the authorities in the Philippines to guarantee the protection of all human rights defenders in accordance with the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, and other international human rights instruments ratified by the Philippines.
