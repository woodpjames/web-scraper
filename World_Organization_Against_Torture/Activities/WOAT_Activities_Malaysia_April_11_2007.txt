Brief description of the situation The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by SUARAM, a member of the SOS-Torture Network, of the detention and risk to personal integrity of 31 asylum seekers and refugees from Burma. According to the information received, 33 Burmese refugees and asylum seekers were arrested, reportedly on the basis of either illegal entry or lack of proper documents, on 4 April 2007 at around 11am in a RELA (People’s Volunteer Corps) raid in Pudu market, downtown of Kuala Lumpur. At the time of issuing the urgent appeal, only 18 individuals were identified, among which five are reportedly recognised refugees by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and others are undergoing the UNHCR verifying process:  Dawt Zing, UNHCR Card (04/MLS/11244)) Mang Hlei Sung, UNHCR Card (345-05C00992) Hgoi Mai (Kachin/Female), UNHCR Card (354-07C00814) Bawi Sung (Female), UNHCR Card (354-03C00576) Hniang Zitial (Female), UNHCR Card (354-06C02539)    Nani, 05/MLS08239     Lal Khar, 05/MLS03057          Ngun Tha Sui, same as above Kip Vung Thang Tawk Kung Sui Mang Duh Za Tim Biak Hu Lian Tuan Cung Tan Zaw Jonathan Mang Chum Dawt  Si Sang Awi  While two nursing mothers, namely Mrs. Bawi Sung, who has a 3-month-old baby, and Mrs. Hniang Zitial, who has a 1-month-old baby, were released on 4 April 2007 after UNHCR intervention, the remaining 31 are being detained at Lenggeng Camp, a detention camp for illegal immigrants in Negeri Sembilan, South of Kuala Lumpur which is reportedly notorious for overcrowding problems and harsh detention conditions. The 31 individuals might face jail sentence and whipping in Malaysia under its immigration law. They are also reportedly in danger of being deported to Burma where they might face grave risks to their personal integrity. The International Secretariat of OMCT is therefore gravely concerned for the physical and psychological integrity of the 31 detained Burmese individuals. OMCT calls on the Malaysian Government to guarantee their integrity at all times, including: ensuring that they are not subjected to whipping and are not deported to Burma, where they might face grave risks to their personal integrity. Moreover, as an elected member of the United Nations Human Rights Council, Malaysia should guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards. Action requested Please write to the authorities in Malaysia urging them to:  Take all necessary measures to guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of the 31 Burmese individuals who were arrested and detained during the raid in Pudu Market, Kuala Lumpur on 4 April 2007; Guarantee that their asylum applications are dealt with in a prompt and impartial manner and that they receive adequate access to the UNHCR; Guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
