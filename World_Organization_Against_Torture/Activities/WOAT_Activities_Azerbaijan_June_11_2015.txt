Geneva,
June 11, 2015 – On the eve of the opening of the first European Games taking
place in Baku, the Azeri government keeps ignoring the international call for
release of jailed human rights defenders and journalists.
The crackdown on Azeri
civil society, NGOs and journalists has particularly escalated over the past
year, as the date of the Baku European Games approached[1].
The result of such a massive repression is the arbitrary arrest and detention
on trumped-up charges of several human rights defenders and journalists, among
whom: Leyla Yunus[2],
member of OMCT General Assembly, Arif Yusunov[3],
Intigam Aliyev[4],
Rasul Jafarov[5],
Khadija Ismayilova[6],
Hilal Mammadov, Anar Mammadli and Rauf Mirqadirov.  
“It is difficult to
understand that the Baku Games could be business as usual for the sporting
community when the Azeri government’s behavior is as far as it could be from
the Olympic principles. A paradigmatic example is that defenders like our
colleague Leyla Yunus remain imprisoned despite their deteriorating health
condition due to the refusal of Azerbaijan to at least release them on
humanitarian grounds. Moreover, it is important to highlight that the repression
seems to be a strategy closely linked with the celebration of the Games in Baku
in order to prevent criticism from spoiling the event as it happened with the
Eurovision contest”, declared
Gerald Staberock, OMCT Secretary General.
On May 28, 2015, Members of the
European Parliament from all political groups issued a joint statement calling
for the unconditional release of political prisoners in Azerbaijan before the
starting of the first edition of the European Games. In the document, they
stressed that "the label 'European' should be given meaning, in the sense
that the European Games should take place while human rights and fundamental
freedoms are respected"[7].
On June 3, 2015, the Council of
Europe Human Rights Commissioner, the OSCE Representative on Freedom of Media
and the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders signed
a joint statement calling for athletes to take a stand on human rights issues
in Azerbaijan[8].
Following the
aforementioned public statements as well as the mobilisation of Sport For
Rights Campaign, an initiative raising the issue of political prisoners in the
context of the forthcoming international sporting events in Azerbaijan, of
which OMCT and FIDH are members, the first statement from the sport world
arrived from Germany.
On June 4, 2015, the German Olympic
Sports Confederation called upon the Azeri authorities to free Azerbaijani
jailed activists before the European Games. Furthermore, top officials of
Germany and members of the government announced on the same day that they would
not attend the opening ceremony of the Baku Games.
The Observatory welcomes the steps
forward taken by some major political and sports stakeholders, and hopes that
this will be of example for others to take a stand for human rights in
Azerbaijan, and to join the call for the immediate and unconditional release of
all arbitrarily jailed human rights defenders and journalists.
“The Observatory calls on all European States to
condition their presence at the opening of the Baku Games to the release of all
imprisoned human rights defenders. The recent events with
Amnesty International’s delegation being barred entry to the country[9]
and UK human rights campaigner Emma Hughes being detained, red-listed and
deported upon her arrival in Baku Airport[10]
just two days ahead of the opening of the Games should effectively be the last
straw and should trigger a strong reaction by other European States”, declared Karim
Lahidji, FIDH President.
Our organizations once again strongly
condemn the ongoing Azeri crackdown on civil society and arbitrary detention of
several human rights defenders and journalists, as they only aim at sanctioning
their human rights work and freedom of expression.
