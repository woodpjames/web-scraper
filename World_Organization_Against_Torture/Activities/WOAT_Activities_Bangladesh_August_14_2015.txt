defenders continues
Paris-Geneva, August 14, 2015 – The three-year prison sentence handed
down to Mr. Mahmudur Rahman yesterday morning by a Dhaka Court is yet another example
of the abusive use of the judicial system to target free speech defenders,
declared the Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders.
“The
assault on freedom of expression is growing in Bangladesh, as any dissent is
stifled through judicial harassment, civil society is silenced through
increasingly repressive laws, and violent crimes against those who exercise
free speech are tacitly permitted”, stated Karim Lahidji, FIDH President. “Mahmudur Rahman must be
released immediately”, he added.  

Mr. Mahmudur
Rahman, acting editor of the Amar
Desh newspaper, was sentenced yesterday to three years in prison by a Dhaka
Court for charges brought against him in 2010 by the
Bangladesh's Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC), which accused him of failing to submit his wealth
statement. He intends to appeal the sentencing.
Mr. Rahman has been detained since April 11,
2013. The Amar Desh
printing press was sealed only hours after his arrest, and has remained closed
since. From April 11 to 24, 2013, Mr. Rahman was subjected to torture while
held in police custody, and eventually charged with sedition and unlawful
publication of a Skype conversation between Md Nizamul Huq, an International
Crimes Tribunal (ICT) Judge, and an external consultant[1] on
December 9, 2012. The published conversation raised doubts about the
impartiality of the ICT and led to the resignation of Judge Huq on December 11,
2012. 
Prior to
his arrest in 2013, Mr. Rahman had already been the target of judicial
harassment. In November 2012, he reported to an Observatory fact-finding
mission that the Bangladeshi authorities had brought nearly 50 defamation and
sedition cases against him since 2008, notably for publishing a report on
alleged corruption practices of the Prime Minister and her relatives, and that
he was already subjected to torture and ill-treatment while he was arbitrarily
detained in relation to these charges[2].
”We call on the Bangladeshi judiciary to put an end
to any form of harassment and violence, including torture and ill-treatment,
against free speech defenders and to strongly reject any evidence that is
obtained through torture”, said
Gerald Staberock, OMCT Secretary General. “We also urge the Bangladeshi
authorities to carry out a prompt, impartial and transparent investigation on
the above-mentioned allegations of torture and ill-treatment, and ensure that
those responsible are held accountable”, he concluded.
Mr. Rahman's latest conviction is only the
last example of the increasing use of intimidation against those who peacefully
exercise and defend the right to free speech in Bangladesh. Four bloggers have
been brutally murdered since February 2015, with police failing to file charges
in any of the cases. In addition, Bangladesh's existing blasphemy laws
criminalise peaceful free speech related to religion, and the Foreign Donations
(Voluntary Activities) Regulation Act 2014, along with the proposed 2015 Cyber
Security Act, serve to stifle free expression and severely restrict the work of
civil society[3].
The Observatory urges
the Bangladeshi government to uphold its obligation under international law to
ensure that its people can exercise and defend the right to freedom of
expression as well as all other human rights. 
The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders (OBS) was
created in 1997 by FIDH and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT). The
objective of this programme is to intervene to prevent or remedy situations of
repression against human rights defenders.
