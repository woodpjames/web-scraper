Brief description of the situation:  The Observatory has been informed of the arrest on May 26, 2003 of Mr. Ruslan Sharipov, an Uzbek human rights activist and independent journalist, who has published several critical articles on police corruption and other human rights issues.  According to the information received, Mr. Sharipov was charged with having committed homosexual acts, under art. 120 of the criminal code, which is in contravention of the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which guarantee non-discrimination and equality before the law. The police are reportedly further inquiring into allegations that Mr. Sharipov had sex with two male minors for money. His colleagues, Mr. Azamat Mamankulov and Mr. Oleg Sarapulov were also arrested.  Mr. Sharipov is currently being detained in Mirzo-Ulugbek District Police Department of Tashkent city. He was granted access to a lawyer on 28th May only, and only in the presence of police officers. During this meeting, Mr. Sharipov said that the police hit him several times, threatened to rape him with a bottle, and put a gas mask on him. He said they also displayed copies of his articles on a table in front of him and shouted at him for long periods.  The Observatory is very concerned by those acts and believes that the charges against Mr. Shapirov may be politically motivated and are designed to prevent him from carrying out his activities in favour of human rights in Uzbekistan. In the past, the Uzbek authorities have used repressive strategies to silence persons who are engaged in denouncing human rights violations perpetrated by the authorities. For example, Mr. Muradov, Mr. Hamraev, Mr. Radjapov and Mr. Utamuratov, all members of the Human Rights Society of Uzbekistan, who were sentenced in 2002 upon false charges, are still in detention and the Observatory has registered many acts of pressure and intimidation against human rights defenders and their families (See Observatory Open Letter to Uzbek President A. Karimov, on 12th May 2003).  Actions requested:  Please write to the Uzbek authorities urging them to:  i. guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of M. Sharipov and his two co-detainees, in all circumstances; ii. release them immediately and drop the charges against Mr. Sharipov, since these charges are believed to aim at hindering his freedom of expression and are therefore arbitrary; iii. abide by the provisions of the Declaration on the Protection of Human Rights Defenders adopted on the 9 December 1998, by the U.N. General Assembly, and more particularly, Article 1 which stipulates that "everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at national and international levels"; iv. more generally abide by the international and regional instruments protecting Human Rights.
