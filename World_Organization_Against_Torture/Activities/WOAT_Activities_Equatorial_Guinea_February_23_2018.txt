		Arbitrary detention /

		Judicial harassment

Equatorial Guinea

		February 23, 2018

		 

		The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a 
partnership of FIDH and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), has 
received new information and requests your urgent intervention in the 
following situation in Equatorial Guinea.

		 

New information:

		 

		The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the ongoing 
arbitrary detention and judicial harassment of Mr. Nsé 
Ramón Esono Ebalé (aka Jamón y 
Queso), cartoonist and blogger[1]. Mr. Esono Ebalé published a graphic novel entitled 
“Obi’s nightmare”[2] in which he depicts President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo 
spending a day living as an ordinary Guinean citizen and suffering the 
consequences of the regime he himself has created. The cartoons especially 
criticise the lack of access to electricity, healthcare, education and the 
restriction to freedom of expression in the country.

		 

		According to the information received, on February 27, 2018, Mr. Esono 
will appear before the Court of Malabo Province (Audiencia Provincial de 
Malabo) under trumped-up charges of “engaging in counterfeit” of 
1,000,000 Francs CFAs (approx. 1,525 Euros) on the basis of Article 283 of 
the Criminal Code and Article 384 of the Law on Criminal Procedure. If 
convicted, he could face up to 40 years in prison.

		 

		The Observatory recalls that Mr. Esono Ebalé has been arbitrarily 
detained at the Black Beach prison since September 20, 2017, following his 
arrest on September 16, 2017 (see background information).

		 

		The Observatory denounces the ongoing arbitrary detention and judicial 
harassment of Mr. Esono Ebalé, which appear to be a retaliation of 
his legitimate human rights activities, and constitute a clear breach of his 
freedom of expression.

		 

		The Observatory urges Equatoguinean authorities to uphold Mr. Esono 
Ebalé’s right to a fair trial and calls on them to immediately 
and unconditionally release him. In the meantime, the Observatory further 
urges Equatoguinean authorities to guarantee his safety and physical and 
psychological integrity.

		 

Background information:

		 

		On September 16, 2017, at around 7:00 pm, Mr. Esono Ebalé and two 
Spanish nationals were arrested by state security guards when leaving a 
restaurant in Malabo. The security guards have reportedly been waiting for 
them for hours outside the restaurant. They were taken for questioning at 
the Office of Counter-Terrorism and Dangerous Activities at the Malabo 
Central Police Station.

		 

		The two Spanish nationals were released on the same day, and reported that 
Mr. Esono Ebalé had been questioned about his drawings of President 
Obiang, and about a number of cartoons, which the police called 
defamatory. All the police questions were related to Ramon’s drawings 
of the President and government officials.

		 

		On September 19, 2017, the national television announced that Mr. Esono 
Ebalé had been arrested and accused by the police of money laundering 
and currency counterfeiting, crimes that can lead to a 40-year prison 
sentence.

		 

		On September 20, 2017 a judge ordered the provisional detention of Mr. 
Esono Ebalé and his transfer to Black Beach prison.

		 

		On December 7, 2017, Mr. Esono Ebalé was notified that he would 
have to appear before the Malabo Court on that same day. Mr. Esono 
Ebalé’s father called the lawyers to inform them. As the 
judicial year had ended on November 30, 2017, two of his lawyers were out of 
town and could not attend the hearing.

		 

		During the hearing, Mr. Esono Ebalé was formally charged with 
“engaging in counterfeit”. Additionally, the judge confirmed Mr. 
Esono Ebalé’s detention pending trial and ordered him to pay 
20,000,000 Francs CFAs (approx. 30,490 Euros) as surety for any future 
liabilities. The judge also ordered the seizure of all assets owned by Mr. 
Esono Ebalé in the country.
