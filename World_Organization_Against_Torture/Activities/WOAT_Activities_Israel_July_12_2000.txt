Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by a reliable source of the shooting of a Palestinian family by Israeli soldiers.  As a result, Mohammed Sharif Eid Moammar, 6 months old, and his older sibling Ra'ed Sharif Eid Moammar, 4 years old, were injured and reportedly in a critical condition; Mohammed has a fractured skull and Ra'ed was treated for injuries at the hospital and then released.  Ms. Itedal Hamza Moammar, their mother, (see case ISR 100700) was dead on arrival at the hospital.  Her husband is also in a critical condition.  According to the information received, at 12 :30 in the morning on Friday, 8 July 2000, the family was driving just before a settlement bridge when Israeli soldiers opened fire from the permanently manned station at the bridge.  According to the report of a witness, who was in a car behind the family and was also shot, the shooting began without warning from the bridge and although the family’s car stopped, the shooting continued.  According to reports from the District Coordinating Office, which are unconfirmed, the shooting came from a car parked on the side of the road.  The District Coordinating Office is a Palestinian Authority office in charge of communicating with Israeli officials.  Normally, cars are not prohibited from parking on the side of the road in this area.  The parked car has yet to be found and the passengers have also not been located.    The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned by the use of excessive force and particularly fire arms which violates international human rights standards, in particular Articles 9, 10 and 11 of the United Nations Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials.   Action requested  Please write to the authorities in Israel urging them to:  i.	guarantee an immediate investigation into the injuries to Mohammed Sharif Eid Moammar and Ra'ed Sharif Eid Moammar, identify those responsible, bring them before a civil competent and impartial tribunal and apply the penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions provided by law; ii.	ensure that all law enforcement agencies conform to international human rights standards; iii.	guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
