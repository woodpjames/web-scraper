New information: The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources of the serious deterioration of the health condition of Mrs. Mukhtabar Tojibaeva, Head of the “Ardent Hearts’ Club”, a human rights organisation based in Margilan, in the Fergana Valley. According to the information received, Mrs. Tojibaeva’s health conditions have been deteriorating, due to the very bad conditions of her detention and to the injuries she has been suffering. Mrs. Tojibaeva has been detained since July 2006 (See background information). The administration of the detention centre in which she is currently placed her on the upper tier of the prison planks, despite the fact that she suffers from high blood pressure. Recently, Mrs. Tojibaeva had a bad fall and spent five days in the medical unit. However, she still cannot walk because of the pain, and suffers from an edema. She also has a sore throat, but has not received adequate attention and treatment yet. Her daughter visited her on November 14, 2007, and reported that she could not move because of pain in her legs and in her back. Recently, the prison guards reportedly told Mrs. Tojibaeva that she would not be released alive from prison. According to the information received, they even left a rope in the punishment cell, therefore provoking her to commit a suicide. The Observatory expresses its deepest concern about Mrs. Tojibaeva’s physical and psychological integrity, and urges the Uzbek authorities to release her immediately and unconditionally since her detention is arbitrary as it merely aims at sanctioning her human rights activities. Furthermore, the Observatory believes that Mrs. Tojibaeva’s case falls within the scope of the decision on amnesty which was adopted by the Uzbek Senate on December 1, 2007, which Article 1 states that women have to be released[1]. The Observatory also deplores the content of the official statement on Mrs. Tojibaeva’s health status that was published on November 18, 2007 by the Uzbek Ministry of Internal Affairs. This official statement discredits the press release of the Human Rights Alliance of Uzbekistan issued the day before to draw attention on her deteriorating health status, and states instead that according to several medical reports made at the occasion of the 23 medical visits that have taken place since July 7, 2006, Mrs. Todjibaeva’s health conditions are satisfactory. The Observatory calls upon the Uzbek authorities to ensure that Mrs. Tojibaeva is granted an appropriate treatment. Background information: On October 7, 2005, Mrs. Tojibaeva was arrested at her home by sixteen officers from the Department of Home Affairs, before being charged with “extortion” under Article 165.2b of the Criminal Code, in connection with a dispute with one of her employees to whom she had lent a large sum of money that was to be repaid to her. It was when this employee visited Mrs. Tojibaeva’s home and returned some of the money that the security forces burst in her home. On December 24, 2005, numerous other charges were filed against Mrs. Tojibaeva. On March 6, 2006, Mrs. Tojibaeva was sentenced to a eight-year term of imprisonment by the court of Dustobod, Urta Chirchik rayon court, in Tashkent oblast, on 17 different charges - mostly economic -, including “slander” (article 139.3 of the Criminal Code) and “membership of an illegal organisation” (article 244) on the grounds that the Ardent Hearts’ Club was not be registered under the “Law on Amendments to the Criminal Code and the Code of Administrative Liability concerning NGOs”, adopted on December 28, 2005. The proceedings were marred by numerous irregularities, in particular several violations of the right to a fair trial. On May 16, 2007, Mrs. Tojibaeva was forced to undergo a “therapy of prophylactic vitamins”. On July 7, 2006, she was transferred from her cell in the Tashkent centre of detention to a psychiatric service for mentally ill and drug-addicted persons, to a women’s detention centre located in the Mirabad district, Tashkent. According to the authorities, this transfer was justified by the fact that Mrs. Tojibaeva had suffered a nervous breakdown after her trial. Mrs. Tojibaeva was allegedly forced to take some medication in July 2006, the content and effects of which were unknown. On July 13, 2006, Mrs. Tojibaeva’s lawyer was allowed to meet with her client, who had her hands tied together. Mrs Tojibaeva did not explain the reasons why, as they were under observation. According to her lawyer, Mrs. Tojibaeva looked very weak and depressed. Actions required: Please write to the Uzbek authorities urging them to:  i. Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mrs. Mukhtabar Tojibaeva; ii.
