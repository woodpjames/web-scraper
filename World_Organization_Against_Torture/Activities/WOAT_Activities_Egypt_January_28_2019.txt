Arbitrary detention / 
Judicial harassment
Egypt

The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights
Defenders, a partnership of FIDH and the World Organisation Against Torture
(OMCT), has received new information and requests your intervention in the
following situation in Egypt.

New information:
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources
about the pursuit of the arbitrary detention and judicial harassment of Dr. Shadi
al-Ghazali Harb, human rights defender known for his role as a youth
activist and leader in the 2011 revolution. 
 
According to the information received, on January 8,
2019, Dr. Shadi al-Ghazali Harb pre-trial detention was renewed for 45 days. He
is accused of “joining a group established in violation to the provisions of
the law and the constitution with the aim to disrupt state institutions, spread
false news, and humiliate the President” (see background information). He is
detained in solitary confinement at Qanater prison since May 16, 2018. At the
time of publication of this appeal, his pre-trial detention had already been
renewed 10 times for 15 days and three times for 45 days.  
 
On January 25, 2019, on the day of the Egyptian
Revolution’s eighth anniversary, Dr. Shadi al-Ghazali Harb started a hunger
strike to denounce his continuing arbitrary detention.   
 
The Observatory recalls that the judicial harassment
and arbitrary detention of Dr. Shadi al-Ghazali Harb’s occurs in the context of
a wave of arrests targeting human rights defenders in Egypt that started in May
2018[1].
 
The Observatory condemns in the strongest terms this
renewed crackdown targeting human rights defenders, and urges the Egyptian
authorities to immediately and unconditionally release Dr. Shadi al-Ghazali
Harb, whose arbitrary detention only aims at sanctioning his human rights
activities. Until then, the Observatory calls on the Egyptian authorities to
guarantee the psychological and physical integrity of all human rights
defenders.
 
The Observatory more generally urges the Egyptian
authorities to put an end to all forms of harassment against them, including at
the judicial level, and to refrain from further punishing their peaceful and
legitimate human rights activities under trumped up, often terrorism-related
charges.
 
Background information:

 
On May 15, 2018, Dr. Shadi al-Ghazali Harb was
arrested after he presented himself to the office of the general prosecution in
Giza where he had been summoned by a warrant from the North Giza Court.
Although he was initially granted a 50,000 EGP bail (approx. 2,400 Euros), he
was then transferred to the Dokki police station where he was detained
overnight. 
 
On May 16, 2018 the State Security Prosecution ordered
his detention for 15 days pending investigation into charges of case no. 621 of
2018, which is targeting a number of human rights defenders, bloggers and
online activists. 
 
Dr. Shadi al-Ghazali Harb is being detained in
solitary confinement at Qanater prison, where he does not have regular access
to his family and lawyers. During the first 15 days of his detention, he was even
denied access to a bed and he was not allowed to go outdoors.
 
On July 25, 2018, the pre-trial detention of Dr. Shadi al-Ghazali Harb, has again been
renewed for 15 days. Dr. Shadi al-Ghazali Harb has been transferred to a new
cell and his conditions of detention have deteriorated. His new cell is very
dirty, hot, and no ventilation is available.

Harb and all human rights defenders in Egypt, and ensure that they are able to
