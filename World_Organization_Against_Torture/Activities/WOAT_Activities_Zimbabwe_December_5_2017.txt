URGENT APPEAL - THE
OBSERVATORY

Acquittal
Zimbabwe
December 5, 2017
 
The Observatory
for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a partnership of FIDH and
the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), has received new
information and requests your urgent intervention in the following
situation in Zimbabwe.
 
New information:
 
The Observatory
has been informed by reliable sources about the acquittal of Pastor Evan Mawarire, prominent
anti-corruption activist who led last year’s #ThisFlag[1]
protests which encouraged Zimbabweans via social media to hold protests against
President Robert Mugabe, accusing him of corruption and causing the economic
crisis.
 
According to the
information received, on November 29, 2017, Harare High Court dropped all
pending charges of “subverting a constitutional government” against Pastor
Mawarire. Charges were levelled against him in February 2017, for leading
demonstrations and demanding an end to corruption and the economic crisis (see
background information).
 
The Observatory
welcomes the dismissal of charges against Pastor Mawarire and thanks all the
persons and institutions that intervened on his behalf.
 
Background information:

In July 2016,
Pastor Mawarire was arrested and charged with “inciting public violence”. The
public prosecutor then altered the charges to “attempting to overthrow a
constitutional government”. However, the Harare Magistrate Vakai Chikwekwe
ruled that Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) officers had violated his constitutional
rights in arresting and detaining him and that the prosecutor acted in
violation of the Constitution by bringing new charges against Pastor Mawarire
while in court.
 
Former President
Mugabe himself publicly attacked Pastor Mawarire accusing him of being a “great
shame” and a “disgrace” for “allowing himself to demonstrate against the
country”.
 
Fearing to be
further harassed and arrested, Pastor Mawarire, left on a self-imposed exile to
the United States for seven months.
 
Pastor Mawarire
returned to Zimbabwe on February 1, 2017, and was immediately arrested at the
airport and charged by the ZRP with “subverting a constitutional government”[2]. The ZRP claims that
the cleric has been “inciting Zimbabweans from all walks of life either locally
or internationally to revolt and overthrow a constitutionally elected
government”. That includes allegations that Pastor Evan Mawarire has incited
some Zimbabweans living in the US and “all over the world” through social media
to converge in New York on September 22, 2016 to “confront” former President
Mugabe, who was attending the United Nations General Assembly and order him to
“immediately” resign from his position under the accusation of destroying the
country.
 
On February 8,
2017, the Harare High Court acceded to a bail request and granted a USD 300
(280 euros) bail to Pastor Mawarire, after finding the State’s case “weak”,
with “no compelling reasons” to maintain him in pre-trial detention. The bail
was accompanied by the obligation to report twice a week (on Mondays and
Fridays) to the Avondale police station. In addition, Pastor Mawarire had to
surrender his passport to the Clerk of the Harare Magistrates Court and was
urged not to interfere with State witnesses.
 
Furthermore, the
High Court found extensive periods of pre-trial detention to be in
contradiction with provisions of the Zimbabwean Constitution, the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights as well as with opinions of the United
Nations Human Rights Committee, and the European Court of Justice.
 
On September 24,
2017, Pastor Mawarire was arbitrarily arrested during a church service in
Milton Park and subsequently detained at Harare central police station. Pastor
Mawarire had initially been charged with “subverting a constitutional government”
under Section 22 (2) of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act, Chapter
9:23.
 
These charges
stem from a video circulated on social media on September 23, 2017, in which
Pastor Mawarire criticised Zimbabwe’s economic policies and urged Zimbabweans
to revolt against them[3].
 
Pastor Mawarire
was taken to the Prosecutor General’s office on September 26, 2017. On the same
day Harare Magistrates Court, ordered his release on the ground that under the
Constitution of Zimbabwe, no one can be detained more than 48 hours without
appearing before a court of law. Charges related to his arrest were
consequently dropped.

Release issued on February 2, 2017.


[3]                In his address, Pastor Mawarire said, “What did we do
to deserve this suffering nhai? There is no evil that surpasses that of
enriching yourself at the expense of poor defenceless people. The extent of
suffering in Zimbabwe is heartbreaking and our leaders see nothing wrong with
it. God is not a fool and He will bring judgement. We will not stop speaking
out and condemning evil and injustice. I’m not going to sit around and just let
it happen all over again. Things are getting worse and we are the ones suffering.
Please people of Zimbabwe let's save our nation.”
