ESCRC     The International Secretariat of OMCT requests your URGENT intervention in the following situation in Colombia.   Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed, by a reliable source, of the continuous death threats directed to Mr. Wilson Arias Castillo, representative of the Sindicato de Empleados del Servicio Nacional de Aprendizaje (SINDESENA), and to workers and trade union leaders who took part in the peaceful occupation of the premises of the Empresas Municipales de Cali (EMCALI), during the months of December 2001 and January 2002. According to the information received, intimidations and threats have been delivered through phone calls, written messages, fake death notices and sometimes even personally. It is also reported that several trade union leaders were forced to flee the country in order to prevent any danger or threat to their physical integrity.   Background Information  These facts occur against the background of discussions on the privatisation of EMCALI, a long time city-owned utility company, located in Cali.  Since  December 26th 1996, when the Cali Municipal Council had laid down “Decree 014”, which provided for the privatisation of EMCALI, local trade unions had reportedly been engaged in formulating proposals and negotiating with the management in order to protect the  public company status of EMCALI. Together with  those proposals, workers and trade unions leaders had organized a series of activities ranging from rallies, permanent assemblies, and peaceful occupations. In 1998, a peaceful occupation had resulted in the revocation of “Decree 014” by the Cali Municipal Council.  However, on December 24th 2001, the Colombian Government decided to militarise the premises of EMCALI and to appoint a Liquidator with a view of laying off workers and proceeding to the privatisation of the company. Workers had therefore begun a 35-days peaceful occupation of the EMCALI Municipal Administrative Centre (CAM) Tower and developed a range of activities to ensure that EMCALI remained a public corporation.   On January 29th 2002, an agreement was eventually signed by the Colombian Government, the Mayor of Cali and trade unions to bring to an end the occupation of the CAM Tower. The agreement completely satisfied the three demands of the union: the company would not be privatised, there would not be any price increase and a high level anti-corruption inquiry would begin to investigate and bring all those responsible of having squandered the company’s public resources in recent years to justice.  Despite the signing of this agreement, which should have guaranteed the resolution of the conflict, threats have continued to be perpetrated against trade union leaders and workers involved in the occupation of the EMCALI offices.   Action Requested  Please write to the Colombian authorities urging them to:    i.	adopt all necessary measures to guarantee the safety and physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Wilson Arias Castillo;  ii.	guarantee an immediate, exhaustive and impartial enquiry into the facts described above, to identify those responsible bring them before a competent and impartial tribunal and apply the penal and civil and/or administrative sanctions foreseen by the law;  iii.	guarantee respect for the economic, social and cultural rights and notably the right of everyone to join and form trade unions as guaranteed by article 8 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights;  iv.	guarantee in all circumstances the respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the country in accordance with national laws and international standards on human rights.
