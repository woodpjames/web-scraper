The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of
the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and the International Federation
for Human Rights (FIDH), requests your urgent intervention in the following
situation in Sri Lanka.
 
Description of the information:
 
The
Observatory has received with great concern information from reliable sources
about the smear campaign and threats suffered by Ms. Nimalka Fernando,
attorney-at-law, women’s rights activist and President of the International
Movement Against All Forms of Discrimination and Racism (IMADR) in Sri Lanka.
Ms. Fernando was also a convener of the alternative summit to the Commonwealth Heads of
Government Meeting (CHOGM), which is taking place in Sri Lanka from November 10
to 17, 2013 amid strong criticism of the country’s human rights abuses.
 
According
to the information received, on November 4, 2013, Ms. Nimalka Fernando
was defamed on a radio programme called Rata Yana Atha (“the way the
country is forging ahead”) on the Commercial Channel of the State-owned
Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation (SLBC). 
 
On
that day, the radio show, entitled “Stoning the Sinner Woman”, was presented by
Mr. Hudson Samarasinghe, Chairman of the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation,
who broadcast fragments of an interview Ms. Fernando had previously granted to HIRU
TV on November 3. Ms. Fernando was described as a 59-year old
divorced woman who had served 30 different organisations, and “since 1989 carried
tales”. 
 
A
number of listeners subsequently phoned the radio to react, and some of them
threatened Ms. Nimalka
Fernando in those terms: “We cannot allow persons like Nimalka Fernando to live in this
society”; “If we do something to them
the government will be blamed by the human rights people. We should use a lorry
and cause an accident”, “There is something call cleaning in the army.
[...] We should hand her over to the cleaning system” or “We use
insecticides to eliminate the spread of mosquitoes. Some mosquitoes develop a
resistance to such spray. These people are like that. We have to find a method
to destroy them”. Ms. Fernando was also called a prostitute. 
 
Reportedly, most of the callers were men, and
some of them identified themselves as having served the armed forces and
retired. Mr. Samarasinghe did not stop the callers in their offensive and
violent statements against Ms. Fernando, and even seemed to encourage them.
 
Subsequently, Ms. Nimalka
Fernando lodged a complaint to the Human
Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRC-SL) and the Inspector General of Police
(IGP), requesting
an investigation for criminal offence and violation of her fundamental rights,
and also demanding that the tapes be secured for proof together with
information of the callers and their telephone numbers.
 
This
is not the first time Ms. Nimalka Fernando has been subjected to a smear
campaign in a State media. For instance, in March 2012, Ms. Fernando, along
with three other human rights defenders, was accused of being a traitor and
working against the interests of the country to obtain “dollars”. In addition,
the Minister of Public Relations threatened Ms. Fernando and the other defenders
involved to “break their limbs” in public if they were to dare to set foot in
the country[1].
 
The
Observatory firmly condemns the death threats and smear campaign against Ms.
Nimalka Fernando, and considers it as an attempt to delegitimise her efforts to
defend human rights in the country. The Observatory urges the Sri Lankan
authorities to guarantee in all circumstances her physical and psychological integrity.
 
Background information:
 
On October 25, 2013, Ms. Maheesha Mudugamuwa
of the Island newspaper asked Ms. Nimalka
Fernando to
comment on three questions: the report of the Health Ministry that indicated
that there are over 40,000 sex workers, her views related to abortion and the
increase of AIDs patients in Sri Lanka. Among others, Ms. Fernando called for
the abolition of abortion laws in Sri Lanka, for safe sex and for promoting a
more protective reproductive health approach in Sri Lanka. She also requested
the journalist not to use the word prostitution. On October 27, 2013, the
journalist wrote her article with the caption “Call for Legalising
Prostitution”[2]. Following this article another
reporter from the Mawbima (the Nation) asked for a clarification and he
too wrote an article with the caption “Legalise Prostitution”. These two
newspaper articles became the centrepiece of debates in few newspapers while
those for and against initiated a public debate. Several FM channels got Ms.
Fernando to clarify her statement and she also had an opportunity to engage in
a public debate over one of the FM channels with the Secretary of the JHU
(Buddhist monk lead political party in Sri Lanka) since they issued a press
statement related to her position, accusing her of destroying culture and
traditional norms of Sri Lanka[3]. Several days later, the TV
channel Hiru also requested her to give few comments under their segment
titled “Hard Talk”.
