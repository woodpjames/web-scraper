New InformationThe International Secretariat of OMCT was informed by the Human Rights Centre of Azerbaijan, a member of the OMCT network, Mr. Eldar Salayev, 72 years old, professor and full member of the Acadamey of Science of Azerbaijan, arrested on 27th October 2005, has been released. However, the conditions of his release are unclear and it is not known if the charges against him have been dropped.  Mr. Salayev’s release follows a visit by the Ombudsman Mrs. Elmira Suleymanova, who asked the Prosecutor General to lift the arrest of Mr. Eldar Salayev,. Furthermore, she visited Mr. Salayev and other detainees on November 12th  2005. Brief Reminder of the Situation The International Secretariat of OMCT was informed by the Human Rights Centre of Azerbaijan, a member of the OMCT network, that Mr. Eldar Salayev, 72 years old, professor and full member of the Acadamey of Science of Azerbaijan, arrested on 27th October 2005, has been accused of preparing the return of Mr. Rasul Guliyev to Azerbaijan.   Mr. Rasul Guliyev, leader of the Democratic Party of Azerbaijan, has been accused of embezzlement, charges which seem to be politically motivated. Mr. Guliyev has been living in the United States for several years and declared that he would return to Azerbaijan to run in the presidential elections. The prosecutor-general had said that he would be immediately arrested and jailed if he returned to Azerbaijan. (see related Case AZE 081105)  A member of the Human Rights Centre in Azerbaijan was able to visit Mr. Salayev, who appeared to be in good health, apart from his eyes, and that his cell was ok.  However, OMCT was gravely concerned by the fact that Mr. Salayev is being held in the prison of the Ministry of National Security which the United Nations Committee against Torture recommended be closed or transferred to the authority of the Ministry of Justice, in 2003. RemarksThe International Secretariat of OMCT wishes to thank the individuals and institutions who intervened on behalf of Mr. Salayev but urges you to continue to write to the authorities in Azerbaijan until all charges against Mr. Salayev are dropped.
