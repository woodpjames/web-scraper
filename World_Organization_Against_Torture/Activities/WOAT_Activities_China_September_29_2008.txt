New information: The Observatory has been informed by Human Rights in China (HRIC) that Mr. Liu Shaokun, a Sichuan school teacher who photographed collapsed school buildings in quake-affected areas and posted his pictures online, was released to serve his Re-education Through Labour (RTL) sentence outside of labour camp. According to the information received, on September 24, 2008, Mr. Liu Shaokun, who was sentenced to one year of RTL (See background information), was released by the authorities to serve his sentence outside the labour camp. Following the decision of the RTL Committee of Deyang City, Sichuan, Mr. Liu returned home around 5 p.m. on September 24. He remains under residential surveillance. The police agreed to return Mr. Liu’s computer and other belongings that they confiscated. The Observatory welcomes the release of Mr. Liu Shaokun and wishes to thank all the persons, organisations, and institutions that intervened in his favour. Nevertheless, the Observatory expresses its concern about Mr. Liu Shaokun’s residential surveillance and recalls that it takes place in the context of a violent wave of repression against Chinese human rights defenders. To that extent, and as China prepares to host the 14th World Conference on Earthquake Engineering on October 12-17, 2008, the Observatory recalls that Mr. Huang Qi, a cyber-dissident and Director of the Tianwang Human Rights Centre (www.64tianwang.com), has been detained since June 10, 2008 and formally arrested for “illegal possession of State secrets”, after he visited the Sichuan earthquake zone numerous times, provided aid to victims of the disaster and published information on his website about the plight of parents who had lost their children[1]. Background information: Mr. Liu Shaokun, a teacher at Guanghan Middle School, Deyang City, Sichuan Province, travelled to heavily hit areas after the May 12 Sichuan earthquake, took photos of collapsed school buildings, and put them online. In a media interview, he expressed his anger at “the shoddy ‘tofu’ buildings”. On June 25, 2008, Mr. Liu was arrested at his school. At the time, authorities informed his school’s principal that Mr. Liu was being held for “disseminating rumours and destroying social order”. Authorities later told Mr. Liu’s family that he was being investigated on “suspicion of the crime of inciting subversion”. However, the family did not receive formal notification for his detention as required under Chinese law. On July 23, 28 days after his detention, Mr. Liu’s wife was informed that there was a letter from her husband to pick up at the Guanghan City Public Security Bureau (PSB). When she arrived, she was given a “Re-education-Through-Labour Notice”, which had Mr. Liu’s signature and fingerprints, but not the length of time he would serve. After Mr. Liu’s wife demanded to know how and why he was placed in RTL, she was told that Mr. Liu would serve one year for “inciting a disturbance”. Under RTL regulations, public security authorities may issue an order to anyone to serve up to four years of RTL without trial or formal charge. Since then, Mr. Liu’s family and Mr. Liu’s work unit have been appealing for a sentence “outside the RTL camp” for Mr. Liu. On September 12, 2008, Mr. Liu’s family was told that the RTL Committee of Deyang City had finally approved their application.
