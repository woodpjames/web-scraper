The Conference is to take place from August 31st to September 7th, 2001 in Durban, South Africa, and OMCT will be represented there by Eric Sottas (Director) and Elsa Le Pennec (Program Officer).  OMCT will firstly take part first in the NGO Forum http://www.racism.org.za/index.html, from August 28th, to September 1st, before attending the Intergovernmental World Conference against Racism http://www.unhchr.ch/html/racism/index.htm.  In view of this conference, OMCT has prepared a report entitled: "Racism and Torture: From national preference to inter-ethnic violence". Through this report, OMCT would like to highlight the link between discriminatory practices and torture, which is not, in its opinion, sufficiently underlined and denounced in the draft Program of Action. OMCT’s report focuses on the situation of the most vulnerable groups in each society such as ethnic, national, linguistic or religious minorities, indigenous peoples, migrants, asylum seekers and refugees, including unaccompanied children.   OMCT also took part in the creation of the International Criminal Justice Caucus during the Second PrepCom meeting in May 2001 in Geneva, in view of promoting the incorporation of measures relating to the criminal justice and prison systems in the final documents of the World Conference. Several issues are of particular concern to the Caucus, including: racial profiling, racial discrimination in the application of the death penalty, use of excessive force by law enforcement officers, and the protection of children within the criminal justice systems.
