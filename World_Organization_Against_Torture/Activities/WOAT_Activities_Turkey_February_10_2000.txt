Brief description of the facts  The Observatory wishes to reiterate its grave concern over another judicial action against a human rights defender.  The first hearing of the trial against Dr. Veli Lök, surgeon and Yzmir Representative for Human Rights Foundation of Turkey, member of FIDH, will be held at Yzmir Penal Court of First Instance No.2, at 09:30, on 11 February 2000.  Dr. Veli Lök is accused of «disclosing opinions about the decisions of remand by the courts (Aliaoa Penal Court of First Instance and Yzmir State Security Court), and inspiring and advising the Court» under Article 30/2 of the Press Law.  This accusation is in connection with the remand and prosecution of two colleagues, Dr. Alp Ayan and Günseli Kaya of the Foundation.  Dr. Ayan and Dr. Kaya, were arrested and detained for allegedly wanting to attend the funeral of one of the prisoners who was killed in the operation of security forces in Ankara (Ulucanlar) Closed Prison on 26th September 1999  (See appeal TUR 003/9910/OBS 065 – Dr. Ayan and Dr. Kaya were released on 20th January 2000 after four months in prison. Their next hearing is scheduled for 17th February 2000.  The comments ob Dr. Lök were published on 31st October 1999 in the newspaper Daily Cumhuriyet. « He said that the aim might have been to make people pay for working for the determination of torture and providing medical treatment for torture survivors, which have been greatly disturbing some powers for years.»  This trial is one of a series of legal proceedings in the last year against various defenders of human rights as a result of their activities.  The Observatory finds these proceedings a flagrant contravention to the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders adopted 9th December 1998 by the General Assembly of the United Nations, and particularly Article 6 which states that « everyone has the right, individually and in association with others…to publish, impart or disseminate to others views, information and knowledge on all human rights and fundamental freedoms. »  Action requested:  Please write to the Turkish authorities urging them to:  i.	ensure that the right to a fair and impartial trial is upheld;  ii.	take the necessary measures to propose legislative amendments in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights and the freedom of opinion and expression which it proclaims and thereby remove articles 132 and 169 of the Penal Code and the anti-terrorist law of the Turkish legislative.  iii.	abide by the provisions of the Declaration on  Human Rights Defenders adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9th 1999  ("Declaration on the Rights and Responsibility of individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms ") and more particularly Article 6 which states that « everyone has the right, individually and in association with others…to publish, impart or disseminate to others views, information and knowledge on all human rights and fundamental freedoms. »  iv.	more generally to abide by the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the regional and international covenants ratified by Turkey.
