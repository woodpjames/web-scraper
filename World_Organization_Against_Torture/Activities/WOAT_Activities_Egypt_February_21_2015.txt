The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights
Defenders, a joint programme of the International Federation
for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), has
received new information and requests your urgent intervention in the following
situation in Egypt.
 
New information:
 
The Observatory has been informed by
reliable sources about the continued judicial harassment and sentencing of Ms. Mahienour
El-Massry, a human rights
lawyer known for her activism in favour of judicial independence and prisoners'
rights by organising peaceful protests, support activities for political
prisoners and using social media to denounce human rights violations.
 
According to the information received, on February 9,
2015, El Raml Misdemeanour Court in Alexandria
sentenced Ms. Mahienour El-Massry, together with another lawyer Amr Abu
Elkhair and eight activists to two years in jail.
 
The defendants were accused of storming the Raml
police station in Alexandria and assaulting police officers as well as torching
the Freedom and justice party headquarters, political arm of the Muslim Brotherhood
in March 2013. Ms. Mahienour El-Massry is not currently detained pending appeal
as a LE 5,000 (approximately EUR 580) bail was paid. Ms. Mahienour El-Massry
has filed a demurrer to challenge the abovementioned sentence.
 
The present decision follows a series of hearings held
on May 8, July 21, October 13 and November 17, 2014 (see background information
below).
 
The Observatory condemns the sentencing of Ms.
Mahienour El-Masry and calls upon the Egyptian authorities to drop all charges
against her as they are clearly aimed at hindering her peaceful human rights
activities.
 
Background information: 
 
On January 2, 2014, Alexandria Manshiya Misdemeanour
Court sentenced in absentia Ms. Mahienour El-Massry and seven members of
the political group “Revolutionary Socialists”[1],
including human rights lawyer Mr. Hassan Mustafa[2],
to two years’ imprisonment and a fine of EGP 50,000 for “protesting without a
permit” and “assaulting security forces” following their participation in a
peaceful protest on December 2, 2013 to denounce police violence and in
particular the impunity of Khaled Saeed murder. Khaled Saeed was killed by
police forces on June 6, 2010 and subsequently became a symbol of police
repression during the 2011 Egyptian Revolution. Ms. Mahienour El-Massry had
failed to appear as she had not been informed in advance of the date of the
hearing. 
 
On May 20, 2014, the Sidi Gaber Misdemeanour Court in
Alexandria rejected the demurrer filed by Ms. Mahienour El-Massry regarding
the sentence issued against her in absentia. Ms. Mahienour El-Massry
was immediately detained following the hearing. 
 
On May 22, 2014, defence lawyers of Ms. Mahienour
El-Massry filed a complaint against the decision to schedule the appeal hearing
on June 26, 2014, arguing that  the
appeal date was too far away in violation of criminal law procedural
provisions. The request was rejected by the court.
 
On May 22, 2014, the Egyptian security forces
violently repressed participants to a solidarity march organised outside of the
headquarters of Egyptian Center for Economic & Social Rights (ECESR) in
Alexandria, following a press conference organised to express support with Ms.
Mahienour El-Massry. Several female protesters were sexually harassed by
security forces. Some protesters were beaten and arrested by the police. After
the march, security forces stormed into ECESR’s headquarters, smashed some of
its equipment and arrested several employees. 
 
On July 20, after successive adjournments, the Sidi
Gaber Appeal Misdemeanour Court in Alexandria sentenced Ms. Mahienour El-Massry
to six months of prison and a fine of EGP 50,000 (approximately EUR 5,143) for
“protesting without a permit” and “assaulting security forces”. Ms. Mahienour
El-Massry's lawyers appealed the sentence before the Court of Cassation. 
 
On September 21, the demurrer was accepted and Al
Mansheya Misdemeanour Appeals Court decided to suspend the execution of Ms.
Mahienour El-Massry's six-month prison sentence, pending the appeal lodged
before the Court of Cassation. This decision followed a request filed by Ms.
Mahienour El-Massry's lawyers challenging the execution of her sentence pending
a final outcome.
 
Moreover, Ms. El-Massry is also facing trial on
separate charges for an incident that occurred in March 2013. In a separate
incident, on May 8, 2014, Ms. El-Massry was referred to court on charges of
“assaulting security forces” after, in March 2013, she and other lawyers went
to Raml police station to provide legal assistance to three activists who were
arrested and sent to the police by supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood (the
“Raml police station” case). The lawyers were attacked by the police in the
police station, and Ms. El-Massry was detained briefly before the Prosecution
decided to release her and the others. The trial was then postponed several
times following the resignation of the appointed judge from the bench. The case
was heard on July 21, 2014 and then postponed to October 13 and November 17,
2014.
 
On November 17, 2014, the Raml Misdemeanour Court held
a hearing in the “Raml police station” criminal case. The court heard three
testimonies provided by witnesses presented by the defence. The defence
additionally requested the court to summon the persons who filed the complaint
against Ms. Mahienour El-Massry, and to include the administrative police case
report. The Court then adjourned the hearing until December 8.
