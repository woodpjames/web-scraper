Judicial
harassment / Arbitrary detention
Cambodia
July 22, 2015
The Observatory for
the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the
International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation
Against Torture (OMCT), has received new information and requests your urgent
intervention in the following situation in Cambodia.
New information:
The
Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the ongoing judicial
harassment against Mr. Ny Chakrya, Head of the Human Rights and Legal
Aid Section of the Cambodian Human Rights and Development Association (ADHOC),
an FIDH member organisation in Cambodia. ADHOC monitors human rights
violations, provides legal assistance to victims of human rights violations –
including victims of land disputes - and engages in human rights advocacy.
According
to the information received, on July 19, 2015, the Deputy Prosecutor of the
Phnom Penh Municipal Court decided to refer Mr. Ny Chakrya’s file on charges of
“public defamation”, “acts of slanderous denunciation”, and “publication of
commentaries to put pressure on jurisdiction” (Art. 305, 311, and 522 of the
Criminal Code respectively) to the investigating judge.
The
investigating judge, who at this point is still unknown, will conduct judicial
investigations in order to decide whether there are sufficient grounds to
believe that Mr. Ny Chakrya committed the three counts of defamation. The investigating judge has the sole power to
formally charge Mr. Ny Chakrya.
Mr. Ny
Chakrya did not receive any notification from the Deputy Prosecutor, informing
him that his complaint and evidence had been submitted to the investigating
judge. He found out from the Cambodian press, which the Deputy Prosecutor had
informed on July 18, upon an inquiry on the progress in Mr. Ny Chakrya’s case.
The
Observatory strongly condemns the ongoing judicial harassment against Mr. Ny
Chakrya, which only aims at sanctioning his legitimate human rights activities.
The
Observatory calls on the Cambodian authorities to put an end to threats and
harassment against human rights defenders in the country.
Background
information:
According
to the summons received by his lawyers on June 26, 2015, and by Mr. Ny Chakrya
personally on July 1, 2015, the Phnom Penh Municipal summonsed Mr. Ny Chakrya
to appear for questioning before the Deputy Prosecutor of the Phnom Penh
Municipal Court on July 13, 2015.
This
follows a complaint filed by the investigating judge of the Siem Reap
Provincial Court and the Deputy Prosecutor of the Siem Reap Provincial Court on
charges of “public defamation”, “acts of slanderous denunciation”, and
“publication of commentaries to put pressure on jurisdiction” (Art. 305, 311, and
522 of the Criminal Code respectively).
The
complaint was related to a press conference organised by ADHOC's office in Siem
Reap on May 12, 2015, during which Mr. Ny Chakrya, along with one ADHOC lawyer,
Ms. Pouk Yarann, condemned the arbitrary arrest and detention of Mr. Ven
Lorn and Mr. Beourn Sok, two
residents of the Chup Romdeng Village (Phnom Sra Ngam area, Kantout Commune,
Svay Leu District, Siem Reap Province) involved in a high profile land dispute
in the Siem Reap Province.
On May 15, 2015, the
Prosecution office of the Siem Reap Provincial Court published a statement threatening Mr. Ny Chakrya and Ms. Pouk Yarann that it
would initiate legal proceedings against them, alleging that the “provocative
comments” made during the press conference jeopardised the effective
functioning of the Cambodian judicial institutions and the on-going proceedings
in the concerned land dispute.
On May
20, 2015, Mr. Ny Chakrya filed a complaint with the President of the
Disciplinary Council of the Supreme Council of Magistracy, claiming that the
proceedings against Mr. Ven Lorn and Mr. Beourn Sok were not conducted in
accordance with fair trial standards because of the lack of independence of the
Deputy Prosecutor. No developments have been observed since the complaint was
filed.
On June
22, 2015, the Cambodian Bar Association lodged a disciplinary complaint against
Ms. Pouk Yarann, accusing her to provide Mr. Ny Chakrya with legal advice when
submitting the complaint to the Supreme Council of Magistracy. She was summoned
for questioning on July 3, 2015 by the Investigating Committee of the Cambodian
Bar Association, which subsequently issued a report to the President of the
Cambodian Bar Association. Since then, there have been no developments.
On June
17, 2015, at 8:30am, Mr. Ven Lorn and Mr. Beourn Sok were found guilty on
charges of inciting a group of residents of Chup Romdeng Village to destroy and
intrude on the property of the agricultural development company, Community
Takhmao Development Agricultural & Industrial[1].
Mr. Ven Lorn and Mr. Beourn Sok were sentenced to six and eight months in
prison respectively. Whereas Mr. Ven Lorn was released on July 3, 2015, after
serving his sentence, Mr. Boeurn Sok has still two months to serve.

plots of agricultural land owned by village residents, affecting 31 families
and a total of 90 hectares of land. A complaint has been filed by the families
affected, demanding the return of their land as well as the continuation of the
use of their land for cultivation purposes.
