URGENT APPEAL - THE OBSERVATORY
 
VNM 001 / 1211 / OBS 140
Sentencing to prison / Arbitrary detention
Viet Nam
December 15, 2011
 
The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint 
programme of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World 
Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent intervention in the 
following situation in Viet Nam.
 
Description of the situation:
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the 
continuing judicial harassment and sentencing to prison of Messrs. Nguyen Van Lia and Tran Hoai An, practitioners 
of an unofficial religious sect who advocate for the respect of the right to 
religious freedom. 
 
According to the information received, on December 12, 2011, Messrs. 
Nguyen Van Lia and Tran Hoai An were found guilty of the charges of “abusing 
democratic freedoms to infringe upon the interests of the State” under Article 
258 of the Criminal Code by the People's Court of Cho Moi District in southern 
An Giang province. They were respectively sentenced to five and three years of 
prison.
 
Messrs. Nguyen Van Lia and Tran Hoai An are practitioners of an 
independent Hoa Hao Buddhist group, which is not recognised by the Government 
and has been subjected to severe repression since the creation of a 
State-sponsored Hoa Hao organisation in 1999. 
 
Messrs. Lia and An both have briefed foreign diplomats regarding 
restrictions and violations of freedom of religion in Viet Nam. In December 
2010, Messrs. Lia and An were among four Hoa Hao activists who met with 
officials of the US Department of State at the US Consulate in Ho Chi Minh City, 
where in May 2009 Mr. Lia, along with other Hoa Hao followers, also attended a 
meeting with the US Commission on International Religious Freedom. In April 
2011, Mr. Lia was arrested with his wife following the discovery by the police 
of, according to State media, books, CDs, DVDs and documents accusing the 
Vietnamese authorities of human rights violations, including religious 
persecution. Mr. An reportedly was arrested by the police on July 2, 2011 in 
Dong Trap province on his way back from visiting fellow Hoa Hao followers in 
prison. Since his arrest in April 2011, Mr. Lia's health has reportedly 
deteriorated considerably. Mr. Lia, who is 71, suffers from high blood pressure 
and broken ribs from old injuries.
 
The Observatory considers that the charges against Messrs. Lia and An 
aim at sanctioning their activities in exposing violations of the right to 
freedom of religion, which is guaranteed under both the Vietnamese Constitution 
and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and urges 
the authorities to stop the routine repression of those who advocate for freedom 
of religion in Viet Nam in violation of the country's international human rights 
obligations.
 
Actions requested:
Please write to the authorities in Viet Nam urging them 
to:
 
i. Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological 
integrity of Messrs. Nguyen Van Lia and Tran Hoai An as well as of all human 
rights defenders in Viet Nam;
 
ii. Ensure that Mr. Lia receives immediate and adequate medical 
treatment for his health conditions;
 
iii. Release Messrs. Nguyen Van Lia and Tran Hoai An immediately and 
unconditionally as their detention is arbitrary, as it seems to merely sanction 
their human rights activities;
 
iv. Put an end to all acts harassment, including at the judicial level, 
against Messrs. Nguyen Van Lia and Tran Hoai An as well as against all human 
rights defenders in Viet Nam;
 
v. Comply with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights 
Defenders, adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 9, 1998, in 
particular:
- its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, 
individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the 
protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the 
national and international levels”, 
- as well as Article 12.2, which provides that “the State shall take 
all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of 
everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, 
threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or 
any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of 
the rights referred to in the present Declaration”;
 
vi. More generally, ensure in all circumstances the respect for human 
rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international and regional 
human rights instruments ratified by Viet Nam.
