The International Secretariat of the World Organisation Against Torture
(OMCT) requests
your URGENT intervention in the following situation in Cambodia.
Brief description of the situation
The International Secretariat of the OMCT has been informed by the
Cambodian Centre for Human rights (CCHR), a member of the OMCT SOS-Torture
Network, about the ongoing detention of 21 protesters[1],
including four human rights defenders, detained following the violent crackdowns
by police and military on protests by garment workers on 2 and 3
January 2014[2]. OMCT has also been
informed about the disappearance of a 16-year-old boy Khem Sophath since
3 January 2014 in the framework of these crackdowns.
According to the information received, Mr Vorn Pao, President of
the Independent Democratic of Informal Economic Association (IDEA), which works
for the promotion of worker’s rights, land and housing rights, Mr Then Saveurn
Coordinator of the Coalition of Cambodian Farmer Community (CCFC), Mr Chan
Puthisak a famous Boeng Kak Lake activist, and Mr Sokun Sombath
Piseth, who works for the Centre for Labor Rights of Cambodia, were
arrested along with six other individuals on 2 January 2014, during a protest
on National Road 4, in front of Yak Jin factory, in Phnom Penh demanding for a
greater increase of the minimum wage. 13 others individuals were arrested on 3 January
2014 near Canadia Industrial Park. They were all initially charged under
Article 411 “Intentionally causing damage with aggravating circumstances” and
Article 218 “Acts of violence with aggravating circumstances” of the Penal Code
2009 facing up to five year’s imprisonment and fines from $1’000 - $ 2’500.
According to the same information received, during the same violent
crackdown by Cambodian security forces, a 16-year-old boy, Khem Sophath, went
missing and disappeared. He was last seen on 3 January 2014, lying on the
ground on Veng Sreng road, at the Canadia Industrial Park, with blood pouring
from what appeared to be a gunshot wound to his chest. More than two months
later his whereabouts remain unknown, and the authorities reportedly neglected
to conduct any investigation. 
Following these events, on 4 January 2014, the Ministry of Interior of
the Royal Government of Cambodia (“RGC”) issued a press release stating that
there was to be a ban on demonstrations, assemblies, or marches until “public
order and security are restored.” On 25 February 2014, the Prime Minister reportedly
committed to lift the ban. However, as of issuing this urgent appeal, the ban
was still in place. 
While two individuals, namely Bou Sarith and Yon Sok Chea, who were among
the 23 protesters arrested early January, were granted bail during a hearing on
7 February 2014 and released under judicial supervision the next day, the Phnom
Penh Court of Appeal denied bail on 11 February 2014 to the 21 aforementioned
protesters on the basis of ending and preventing crime and ensuring detainees
are available for trial. 
On 14 March 2014, the investigating judge informed the lawyers of the 21
protesters that the investigation was closed and that he had sent the file to
the court. According to the same information received, the investigating judge
changed the charges against Mr Vorn Pao, Mr Chan Puthisak, Mr Then Saveurn and
Mr Sombath Piseth, but not against the other detainees. The charges are now on
the grounds of Article 494 and 495 of the Penal Code, which refer to the incitement
to commit a felony, punishable with six months to two years of imprisonment. As
of issuing this urgent appeal, no date for a hearing had been set. Furthermore,
on 24 March 2014, the Court of Appeal again denied Mr Vorn Pao bail. 
According to the same information received, the 21 aforementioned
individuals remain detained at the Correctional Center 3 (‘CC3’), a maximum-security
prison, in Kampong Cham province. The health conditions of some of the
detainees are a serious concern. Mr Vorn Pao, who had earlier a kidney surgery,
required a medical check-up in Thailand in February, but he was not able to go
due to his ongoing detention. Currently, he would be in pain because of his kidney
and the lack of appropriate medical attention. Mr Sombath Piseth’s left hand
was reportedly broken during the protests on 2 January 2014 when he was
detained. However, he has not received any proper treatment. Mr Chan Puthisak
has reportedly swollen legs because he was not allowed to go outside for
exercises for almost 20 days as a punitive measure. 
OMCT expresses its
deep concern about the ongoing detention of the 21 protesters, including the
four human rights defenders, and calls on the Cambodian authorities to
immediately and unconditionally release all of them and to drop the charges
against them, as they seem to be aimed at merely sanctioning their peaceful
exercise of their freedom of association, assembly and expression. 
OMCT recalls the UN
Human Rights Council resolutions 19/35 (preambular para. 11) and 22/10
(preambular para. 16), stressing that “peaceful protests should not be viewed
as a threat, and therefore […] all States [should] engage in an open, inclusive
and meaningful dialogue when dealing with peaceful protests and their causes”.
OMCT further urges
the competent authorities to guarantee at all times the physical and
psychological integrity of all 21 protesters and to grant them immediate access
to adequate medical care. 
Action requested
Please write to the authorities of Cambodia urging them to:
i.              
Take all necessary measures
to guarantee at all times the physical and psychological integrity of all 21
protesters, and to ensure that they have full access to
their families, lawyers, medical professionals and adequate medical care and
civil society groups;
ii.             
Carry out an immediate,
exhaustive and adequate investigation concerning the fate and the whereabouts
of 16-year-old Khem Sopath and disclose his whereabouts; 
iii.           
Order the immediate release
of all the aforementioned 21 protesters and immediately
and unconditionally drop the charges against them, as they
seem to be aimed at merely sanctioning their peaceful exercise of their freedom
of association, assembly and expression;
iv.           
Give clear instruction to
security forces to refrain from using force against protestors and to act in
accordance with human rights standards, notably with the United Nations Basic
Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms; 
v.             
Guarantee the respect of
human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance
with international human rights standards.
