International Human Rights Organisations welcome a historic 
opportunity to create a national protection mechanism for human rights defenders 
and journalists 
 
Dear Senators and Deputies, 
Dear Minister of the Interior,
 
We, the undersigned organisations, call on Mexican Senators and 
Deputies to fully support the Bill of Law to establish a National Mechanism for 
the Protection of Human Rights Defenders and Journalists in Mexico. We also call 
on the Executive to complete the process of agreeing operational guidelines and 
developing the protocols to implement this mechanism.
 
Human rights defenders (HRDs) and journalists in Mexico are still 
subject to intimidation, legal harassment, arbitrary detention, death threats, 
acts of physical aggression, forced disappearances and killings as a result of 
their activities in defence of human rights and the exercise of freedom of 
expression and journalism.
 
Several international organisations and bodies have expressed concern 
for the lack of protection for human rights defenders and those who exercise 
freedom of expression in Mexico, such as the recommendations issued on the 
occasion of the 2009 Universal Periodic Review of Mexico, and the 
recommendations of the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of Human Rights 
Defenders, the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the UN and OAS Special 
Rapporteurs on Freedom of Expression, and the UN Human Rights Commission, who 
noted that in the past decade Mexico has become one of the world's most 
dangerous countries for journalists to exercise their 
profession.
 
The existing security measures are inadequate and ineffective and 
contribute to the severity and frequency of the abuses suffered resulting in 
high levels of impunity. Those affected have reported deficiencies in the 
implementation of protective measures, a lack of coordination between the 
Mexican state agencies involved in their protection, and insufficient monitoring 
of prescribed measures.
 
In response to the serious risk HRDs face, several non-governmental 
human rights organisations developed a proposal for a National Mechanism for the 
Protection of Human Rights Defenders and Journalists at 
risk.
 
We welcome the approval of the Bill for a Protection Mechanism for 
Human Rights Defenders and Journalists by the Legislative Research Commission 
and the Commission of the Interior in the Senate after the official presentation 
of the Bill in the Senate on 15 March 2012. 
 
We urge the Senate to approve the draft law without amendments so 
that the Chamber of Deputies can also examine and approve it during this 
parliamentary session. The approval of the bill is a fundamental step towards 
the establishment of the Mechanism as an instrument for the effective protection 
of human rights defenders and journalists. The full support of the Senate and 
Chamber of Deputies would secure a breakthrough in the national legal framework 
to ensure the protection of human rights defenders, beyond the results of the 
presidential elections later this year.
 
The organisations signing this letter also recognise the importance 
of the parallel and complementary process led by the Ministry of the Interior 
and civil society representatives to agree operational guidelines for a 
governmental protection mechanism. We call on the Federal Government to develop 
the necessary protocols to make this mechanism effective as quickly as possible, 
in a transparent manner, and in consultation with Mexican civil society 
organisations.
 
The Bill provides the legal basis to ensure that the governmental 
protection mechanism has a lasting impact. We therefore fully support the 
current legislative process and urge the Mexican Government to ensure the full 
development and implementation of an adequate and effective mechanism to protect 
human rights defenders and journalists.
 
Yours sincerely,
