Description of the situation: The Observatory has been informed by People’s Watch about the ongoing judicial harassment against Mr. Marimuthu Barathan, President of the Human Rights Education and Protection Council (HREPC), who has been working closely with Dalit communities in Tirunelveli and surrounding southern districts of Tamil Nadu State[1]. According to the information received, Mr. Marimuthu Barathan has been subjected to judicial harassment since May 27, 2009, when he was arrested by the police, accused of the murder of a man called Mr. Madhan, assassinated on January 11, 2009. On that same date, around 20 Dalit people were killed and Mr. Barathan was also accused of involvement in those killings[2].  Mr. Barathan was taken to the Suthamalli Police station where a First Information Report (FIR) was filed. He was subsequently charged for various offences on May 27, 2009[3].  Mr. Barathan was placed on remand in the Palayamkottai Prison until June 3, 2009, when he was taken to the Judicial Magistrate Court in Cheranmadevi for a hearing. On June 19, 2009, he was transferred from the Tirunelveli Central Prison to the Cuddalore Central Prison. On June 27, 2009, Mr. Barathan was released from prison, on condition bail, which was relaxed on August 4, 2009. Since then, Mr. Barathan no longer has to sign daily in a police station in Thiruvananthapuram, the capital of the neighbouring State of Kerala, about 60 kilometres away from Tirunelveli, where he currently lives. The latest hearing in Mr. Barathan’s case was scheduled for August 25, 2009 but as he was not able to attend, he filed a petition and the hearing was re-scheduled to a later date. The Observatory denounces the judicial harassment faced by Mr. Barathan and believes that these acts of harassment merely aim at sanctioning his human rights activities and therefore urges the Indian authorities to put an end to the judicial harassment against him.  Actions requested: Please write to the authorities of India, urging them to:   Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Marimuthu Barathan;  Put an end to all acts of harassment - including at the judicial level - against Mr. Marimuthu Barathan as well as against all human rights defenders in India so that they are able to carry out their work without unjustified hindrances;  Comply with all the provisions of the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, in particular with its Article 1, which provides that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, as well as with Article 12.2 (“the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”);  More generally, ensure in all circumstances the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with international and regional human rights instruments ratified by India.
