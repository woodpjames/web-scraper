Brief description of the situation: The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the extra-judicial killing of Mr. Armando Dolorosa, Vice President of the National Federation of Sugarcane Workers (NFSW) and the leader of an agrarian reform group in Manapla, Negros Occidental. According to the information received, on June 6, 2008, Mr. Armando Dolorosa was shot dead in his house by three masked men in the presence of his wife and 11 year-old son. He reportedly sustained 23 gunshot wounds. According to his relatives, there are strong reasons to believe that his killing is related to the implementation of the agrarian reform program: in 2007, Mr. Dolorosa and 36 other agrarian reform beneficiaries were granted certificates of land ownership by the Department of Agrarian Reform, and were therefore given a portion of a sugar estate. Since then, Mr. Dolorosa had been receiving death threats from persons his wife described as “planters”. He is the third local NFSW leader to be killed in Manapla since 2003. The Observatory expresses its deep concern over the killing of Mr. Armando Dolorosa which is further evidence of the ongoing attacks against human rights defenders perpetrated by both state and non-state actors in the Philippines, and recalls that the Philippines has been elected as a member of the Human Rights Council until 2010 and has, in this regard, committed to “uphold the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights”[1]. Accordingly, the Observatory urges the Philippines to comply with Article 12.2 of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 9, 1998, which states that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”. Actions required: Please write to the authorities of the Philippines urging them to:   Guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of all human rights defenders in the Philippines;  Conduct a fair and impartial investigation into the assassination of Mr. Armando Dolorosa in order to identify all those responsible, bring them before a competent and impartial tribunal and apply to them the penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions provided by the law;  Guarantee that adequate reparation is provided to his relatives;  End all forms of harassment and ill-treatment of human rights defenders in the Philippines, and guarantee in all circumstances that they be able to carry out their work without any hindrance;  Conform with all the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, especially its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels” and above-mentioned Article 12.2;  More generally, ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by the Philippines.
