The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint 
programme of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and the International 
Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), has received new information and requests 
your urgent intervention in the following situation in Belarus.
 
New information:
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources that 
the Belarusian Ministry for Taxes and Duties has asked to initiate the 
process of closing down the Belarus Helsinki Committee (BHC), one of the few formally 
registered human rights organisations in 
Belarus.
 
According to the information received, on December 21, 2011, Mr. 
Aleh Hulak, BHC Chairman, was informed by the Ministry of Justice 
that it had been requested by the Ministry for Tax and Duties to dissolve the 
organisation.
 
According to Article 29 of the Law on Non-Governmental Organisations 
(NGOs), the decision to dissolve an organisation requires two warnings issued by 
the Ministry of Justice for the same offence during the year. 

 
On January 12, 2011, the BHC received a written warning from the 
Ministry of Justice for violating the Law on Civic Organisations and 
Mass Media and for spreading dubious information discrediting the law 
enforcement and justice agencies of Belarus. At issue was a letter that the BHC 
sent on January 11, 2011 to the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the 
Independence of Judges and Lawyers detailing the intimidation faced by lawyers 
representing opposition leaders arrested on December 19, 
2010. 
 
On June 6, 2011, the BHC received a second warning for violation of tax law. It is requested to pay more 
than 240 million Belarusian rubles (about 21,842 euros) of taxes and fines for 
receiving a grant from the European Commission in 
2002-2003.
 
The BHC appealed both warnings to the Supreme Court, but none of them was 
answered. 
 
The Observatory expresses its deep concern about the process that was 
initiated to close down the Belarus Helsinki Committee, which it considers as merely aiming at 
sanctioning its legitimate human rights activities. Accordingly, 
the Observatory urges the Belarusian authorities to refrain from 
harassing the Belarus Helsinki Committee and, more generally, human rights defenders in the country, and to 
guarantee their rights to freedoms of association and expression. 

 
Actions requested:
 
The Observatory urges the authorities of Belarus to:
 
i. Put an end to all forms of harassment against members of BHC as 
well as against all human rights defenders in Belarus and ensure that they are, in all 
circumstances, able to carry out their work freely without any 
hindrances;
 
ii. Comply with all the provisions of the United Nations Declaration 
on Human Rights Defenders, , adopted on December 9, 1998 by the United Nations 
General Assembly, in particular with:
- its Article 1, which provides that “everyone has the right, 
individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the 
protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the 
national and international levels”; 
- as well as its Article 12.2, which states that “the State shall 
take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent 
authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against 
any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, 
pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate 
exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”.
 
iii. Comply with paragraph 8 of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly Resolution on 
Strengthening OSCE Engagement with Human Rights Defenders and National Human 
Rights Institutions, which states that OSCE Participating States recognise 
“the need for particular attention, support and protection for human 
rights defenders by the OSCE, its Institutions and field operations, as well as 
by participating States”;
 
iv. More generally, ensure in all circumstances the respect for human 
rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with in accordance with the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with international and regional human 
rights instruments ratified by Belarus.
