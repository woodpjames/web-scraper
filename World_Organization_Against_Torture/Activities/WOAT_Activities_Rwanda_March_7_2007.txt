Brief description of the situation:  The International Secretariat of the OMCT has been informed by a reliable source of the criminal proceedings against Mr. Idesbald Byabuze Katabaruka, who is a Congolese professor at Kigali’s Université Adventiste Laïque (UNILAK). Mr. Idesbald Byabuze Katabaruka was arrested on 16 February 2007.   According to the information received, Mr. Idesbald Byabuze Katabaruka is currently being held at the central Kigali prison (PCK) known as “1930”. On 23 February 2007 Kagarama base tribunal at Gikondo ordered Mr. Idesbald Byabuze Katabaruka’s preventive detention for a period of 30 days while awaiting his trial. Mr. Idesbald Byabuze Katabaruka has been accused of “endangering State security” and of “discriminatory and sectarian abuses”. These charges were allegedly based on a report titled “Rwanda Alert” (“Alerte Rwanda”) published in June 2005. This report is said to have been critical of President Paul Kagame’s government of Rwanda. The report allegedly cited Mr. Idesbald Byabuze Katabaruka as a co-author.   Mr. Idesbald Byabuze Katabaruka is also a professor at the Catholic University of Bukavu (Université catholique de Bukavu), in South Kivu. Furthermore, he writes for the journal “Mashariki News”, published in Bukavu.   According to the same information, Mr. Idesbald Byabuze Katabaruka’s health is very fragile. Due to a stomach operation, he must follow a strict dietary regime as well as receive regular health care to which he has had no access since having been detained.   The International Secretariat of the OMCT is greatly concerned with the criminal proceedings against Mr. Idesbald Byabuze Katabaruka, and requests his immediate release in the absence of valid legal charges. If such charges exist, to ensure that he is given a prompt and fair trial, in which his procedural rights are guaranteed at all times. OMCT is concerned with this particular arrest, which seems to be aimed at punishing freedom of expression. Furthermore, OMCT is worried about Mr. Idesbald Byabuze Katabaruka’s fragile health.   Actions requested: Please write to the Rwandan authorities urging them to:    Guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Idesbald Byabuze Katabaruka under all circumstances;  Guarantee that he has access to adequate health care; Order his immediate release in the absence of valid charges, and if such charges exist, ensure that he is given a prompt and fair trial, in which his procedural rights are guaranteed at all times; Launch a thorough, independent and impartial investigation into these events, in order to identify all those responsible, bring them to trial before an independent, competent and impartial civil tribunal, and apply the penal and/or administrative sanctions as provided by law; Guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international regulations.
