Arbitrary detention /
Judicial
harassment
Egypt
December 22, 2017
 
The Observatory for the Protection
of Human Rights Defenders, a partnership of the World Organisation Against
Torture (OMCT) and the FIDH, requests your urgent intervention in the following
situation in Egypt. 
 
Description of the situation:
 
The Observatory has been
informed by reliable sources about the arbitrary detention and judicial
harassment of Ms. Mahienour El Massry,
human rights lawyer known for her activism in favour of judicial independence
and prisoners’ rights by organising peaceful protests, support activities for
political prisoners and using social media to denounce human rights violations.
 
According to the
information received, on November 18, 2017, the Misdemeanor Montaza Court in
Alexandria ordered the detention of Ms. Mahienour El-Massry pending trial, in
relation to the protests against the Tiran and Sanafeer land agreement in June
2017[1],
which has resulted in the arrest of 60 activists throughout the country[2].
She is accused of “participating in an unauthorized protest”, “insulting the
President” and thuggery. The next hearing is scheduled on December 30, 2017.
 
On December 16, 2017,
Ms. Mahienour El-Massry’s family went to visit her in Qanater El Khayereya
Women’s Prison in Cairo. There, they were told that she had been deported to
Damanhour prison, which is closer to Alexandria.
 
Thus, on December 17,
2017, Ms. Mahienour El-Massry’s family went to Damanhour prison to visit her.
They reported that Ms. Mahienour El-Massry had been in a put in a “waiting
room” since her transfer. The waiting room was reportedly overcrowded and Ms. Mahienour
El-Massry was prevented from eating, drinking or using the toilet. In addition,
as the decision to transfer her to Damanhour prison was very sudden, Ms. Mahienour
El-Massry was unable to pack all her needs when she left Qanater prison. 
 
The Observatory recalls
that Egyptian authorities have a long history of harassing and detaining Ms. Mahienour
El-Massry. Already, in January 2014, she was
sentenced to 2 years in jail for exercising her right to peacefully protest
against police violence. Her sentence was reduced in appeal to six months[3].
 
Arrested again on May
11, 2015, the El Raml Misdemeanour Court of Appeal in Alexandria sentenced her
on May 31, 2015, to one year and three months in jail with another lawyer and
eight activists for “assaulting security forces”. This relates to an incident
that occurred in March 2013, when they went to Raml police station to provide
legal assistance to three activists. From Qanater women’s prison, she started a
hunger strike with six other detainees on July 28, 2016, to protest against the
denial of family visits in prison. After serving the fifteen-month prison
sentence, Mahienour El-Massry was released on August 13, 2016[4].
 
The Observatory strongly
condemns the arbitrary detention of Ms. Mahienour El-Massry, her judicial
harassment, which are part of a wider trend of repression against her and other
human rights defenders in Egypt.
 
The Observatory calls
upon Egyptian authorities to immediately and unconditionally release her and to
put an end to all forms of harassment, including at the judicial level against
her, as they are clearly aimed at hindering her peaceful and legitimate human
rights activities and in the meantime to guarantee her physical and
psychological integrity and her right to a fair trail.

authorities of Egypt asking them to:

psychological integrity of Ms. Mahienour El-Massry;

Mahienour El-Massry and all human rights defenders detained in Egypt;
 
     iii.        
Put an end to all acts of harassment, including at the
judicial level against Ms. Mahienour El-Massry and
all human rights defenders in Egypt;
 
    iv.        
In the meantime, guarantee the right of a fair trial and a
due process of Ms. Mahienour El-Massry;
 
     v.        
Refrain from further hindering the right to freedom of
association, peaceful assembly and expression in Egypt;
 
    vi.        
Conform with the provisions of the UN
Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the
United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially Articles 1, 6(c) and 12.2; and
 
   vii.        
More generally, ensure in all circumstances the
respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with international and regional human
rights instruments ratified by Egypt.

14, 2017, to ratify a maritime agreement that would place the islands of Tiran
and Sanafeer under Saudi control. In the wake of the Parliament’s decision,
protests erupted throughout several governorates of the country. On June 20,
2017, Egypt’s highest constitutional court stopped the transfer agreement.
