Alleged extra-judicial killings
The International
Secretariat of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) requestsyour
URGENT intervention in
the following situation in India/ West Bengal
Brief description of the situation
The International Secretariat of OMCT has been
informed by Banglar
Manabadhikar Suraksha Mancha
(MASUM), a member of OMCT SOS-Torture Network, about the alleged extrajudicial
killings of three minors, Sukumar Mondal aged around 15, Sunil
Mondal aged 16, Raju Mondal aged about 17 and one adult, Babar
Seikh aged about 19, near the village of Ranitala, in the district of Murshidabad.
According to the information
received, at around midnight on 31 December 2011, Sukumar Mondal, Sunil Mondal, Raju Mondal
and Babar Seikhwerekilled
in front of Harudanga Mini Border Security Force (BSF) BOP Camp, near the Golpal
rivulet situated at Nirmal Char by a group of about 30 members of the BSF, attached
to the 105 Battalion, Harudanga BSF mini camp. Sukumar Mondal, Sunil Mondal, Raju
Mondal and Babar Seikhwere reportedly trying to smuggle cows when the
BSF stopped them by firing from flare guns. The BSF then allegedly surrounded
the four individuals, who were hiding in the ice cold rivulet, and started to
beat them with sticks while preventing them to get out of the water. 
On the following days, on 1 January 2012 and 2 January 2012, local villagers found the bodies of Sukumar
Mondal, Sunil Mondal, Raju Mondal and Babar Seikh. They were then transferred
to Lalbagh Sub Divisional Hospital for a post mortem examination. According
to testimonies provided by villagers, the bodies had marks all over, in particular
the body of Sukumar Mondal. 
According to the same information, family members of
the deceased made written complaints on 27 January 2012 to the Superintendent of Police of the Murshidabad
district, after they were prevented to lodge a complaint at the police station
against the BSF. It is reported that the Ranitala Police initiated four
unnatural death cases (Case No. 1 and 2 for Sunil Mondal and Sukumar Mondal,
dated 2 January 2012; and Case No. 3 and 4 for Babar Seikh and Raju
Mondal, dated 3 January 2012). However, to date, no information on the status of
the investigation has been reportedly disclosed. 
OMCT has also been informed that, on 25 March 2012, family
members of Sukumar Mondal, Sunil Mondal, Raju Mondal and Babar Seikh, along
with other individuals, were stopped by four members of the BSF, attached to
the Kaharpara BSF BOP, Company Head Quarter’s Out Post No. 1, when they were
coming back in a rickshaw from a medical camp organised in Padma by MASUM. The
four BSF members allegedly started to beat and verbally abuse them. They also
threatened them in relation to the complaints saying that ‘you are making
campaigns against BSF’. 
The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely
concerned about the circumstances of the killing of Sukumar Mondal, Sunil Mondal,
Raju Mondal and Babar Seikhand therefore
calls on the competent
authorities to ensure that an investigation is carried out promptly, effectively,
thoroughly, independently and impartially, in
accordance with international human rights standards, inter alia, with the UN
Principle on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal,
Arbitrary and Summary Executions, the result of which must be made public, in
order to bring those responsible before a competent, independent and impartial
tribunal and apply penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions as provided by
law.
OMCT
recalls that the authorities have to fulfil their obligations under the Indian Constitution and under international human rights
law to protect the right to life
and the right not to be subjected to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading
treatment or punishment and to bringing to justice those responsible for
violating this right.
OMCT has indeed
documented many cases of indiscriminate killings and torture committed by the
BSF over the years in West Bengal, against both Indian and Bangladeshi
nationals, in an alleged effort to contain illegal cross-border activities. Although in some
cases complaints were lodged, no effective investigations have been carried out
and no perpetrators were brought to justice.
