The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of
the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and the International Federation
for Human Rights (FIDH), requests your urgent intervention in the following
situation in Burma.
 
Brief
description of the situation:
 
The
Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the arbitrary arrest of
Mr. Thaw Zin, a member of the Yangon People's Support Network and an activist campaigning for farmers affected by the Letpadaung copper mine in Salingyi Township, Sagaing Region[1].  
 
According
to the information received, on February 11, 2014, at about 10 am, six plain-clothed police officers arrested Mr. Thaw Zin in
Salingyi Township. Shortly after the arrest, about 100 villagers marched to the
Nyaungpingyi police station, calling for Mr. Thaw Zin’s release, but the
authorities declined to explain the reasons of the arrest. Later, the police
only confirmed that Mr. Thaw Zin had been sent to Monywa prison.

 
The
Observatory fears that Mr. Thaw Zin was
arrested for organising several demonstrations that led to confrontations between residents
affected by the Letpadaung copper mine and
staff of Wan Bao in 2013.
Mr. Thaw Zin had previously been
detained in 2013 under Article 18 of the Peaceful Assembly and Peaceful
Procession Law, for organising protests without obtaining the authorities’
prior permission[2]. The charge was subsequently dropped under a
presidential amnesty announced on December 31, 2013.
 
The
Observatory condemns the arrest and judicial harassment of Mr. Thaw Zin, which seem to merely
aim at sanctioning his peaceful human rights activities, and calls upon the
Burmese authorities to release him immediately and unconditionally.
 
Background information:
 
Peaceful protests that began in August 2012 against the Letpadaung
copper mine were heavily repressed by the authorities on several occasions. In
November 2012, police used white phosphorus bombs to disperse peaceful
protestors, injuring dozens, including Buddhist monks.
 
Actions
requested:
 
Please
write to the authorities of Burma, urging them to:
 
i.              
Guarantee in all
circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Thaw Zin as well as of all human rights defenders in Burma;
 
ii.             
Release Mr. Thaw Zin immediately and
unconditionally since his detention is arbitrary and only aims at sanctioning
his human rights activities;
 
iii.           
Put an end to acts of
any acts of harassment, including at judicial level, against Mr. Thaw Zin and all human
rights defenders in Burma;
 
iv.            
Comply with all the
provisions of the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, in
particular with its: 
-       
Article 1, which
provides that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with
others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realization of human
rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”;
-       
Article 6(a), which
foresees that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with
others, to participate in peaceful activities against violations of human
rights and fundamental freedoms”;
-       
Article 12.2, which
provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the
protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in
association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de
facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other
arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the
rights referred to in the present Declaration”;
 
v.             
More generally, ensure in
all circumstances the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in
accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and ratify international
and regional human rights instruments.
