Brief description of the situation: The Observatory has been informed by Task Force Detainees of the Philippines (TFDP) of the arbitrary detention of Mr. Ricardo Bellamia y Beceril, an organiser of labour unions for Kilusang Mayo Uno - Labour Centre (KMU), an organisation struggling in favour of workers’ rights, and a member of the National Federation of Labour in Barangay Casay in Dalaguete town, province of Cebu. According to the information received, on November 2, 2007, at about 2 pm, Mr. Bellamia was arrested at home by members of both the Regional Command of the Philippine National Police (PNP) and of the Armed Forces of the Philippines Central Command (CENTCOM), on the basis of a warrant of arrest issued by the Judge Sylvia Aguirre Delanga of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 25, Danao City, dated March 21, 2006. On November 5, 2007, Mr. Bellamia was brought to Court and charged with “rebellion” by the Regional Trial Court, Branch 25, Danao City. He would be accused of being an official of the New People’s Army (NPA) and of being linked to the killing of soldiers belonging to the 78th Infantry Battalion during rebel-military encounters that occurred reportedly in 2004 at Brgy Dalid, Tabuelan town, Brgy Sumon and Brgy Kalanggaman in Tuburan, and Brgy Baliang in Danao City, all in the province of Cebu. Yet, Mr. Bellamia has always denied being a NPA member. As of issuing this urgent appeal, Mr. Bellamia would be detained at the Central Command of the Armed Forces of the Philippines at Camp Lapu-lapu in Apas, Lahug, Cebu City. The Observatory expresses its deep concern about the arbitrary detention of Mr. Ricardo Bellamia y Beceril as it seems to merely aim at sanctioning his human rights activities. The Observatory further urges the Philippines authorities to put an end to any kind of harassment against all human rights defenders in the country, as well as to conform with the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 9, 1998, especially its Article 12.2, which states that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”. Action requested: Please write to the Philippine authorities asking them to:  Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Ricardo Bellamia y Beceril; Release Mr. Ricardo Bellamia y Beceril immediately and unconditionally since his detention is arbitrary as it merely aims at sanctioning her human rights activities; End all forms of harassment and ill-treatment of human rights defenders in the Philippines, and guarantee in all circumstances that they be able to carry out their work without any hindrance; Conform with all the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, especially its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels” and above-mentioned Article 12.2; More generally, ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by the Philippines.
