Abduction / 
Arbitrary and incommunicado detention
Egypt
September 13, 2017
 
The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a partnership of FIDH
and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent
intervention in the following situation in Egypt.

 
Description
of the situation:
 
The
Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the abduction and
arbitrary and incommunicado detention of Mr. Ibrahim Metwally Hegazy, human rights lawyer, Co-founder and Coordinator
of the Association of the Families of the
Disappeared in Egypt[1].
Mr. Ibrahim Metwally Hegazy reportedly also provided legal advice to Giulio
Regeni’s family[2].
 
According
to the information received, on September 10, 2017, Mr. Metwally Hegazy
disappeared at Cairo International Airport before boarding a flight to Geneva.
Mr. Metwally Hegazy was travelling to Switzerland in response to an invitation
by the United Nations Working Group on Enforced and Involuntary Disappearances
(WGEID) to attend the proceedings of its 113th Session , held from
September 11 to 15, 2017 at the UN Human Rights Council.
 
His
family lost contact with him around 8 am after he had arrived at the airport,
texting that he “was heading to the security [forces’] office” which is near
passport control. They subsequently contacted the authorities at the Geneva
airport who communicated that the latter had not arrived on the flight from
Cairo, leading them to believe that he had been arrested at Cairo International
Airport. The lawyers of Mr. Metwally Hegazy contacted the airport police and
looked for him in nearby police stations but they were not able to obtain any
information on his whereabouts. They subsequently sent a telegram to the
prosecutor general’s office to report the suspected arrest.
 
The
whereabouts of Mr. Metwally Hegazy remained unknown from that date until
September 12, in the evening, when the Stop Enforced Disappearance Campaign
reported he had been located in State Security Prosecution custody, in
Al-Tagammo’ al-Khamis on the outskirts of Cairo. He was interrogated by the
State Security Prosecution (SSP) for charges of communicating with foreign
entities to harm state security, spreading false news and forming and managing
a group that was formed against the law and the constitution. During his
interrogation, his home was searched by security forces. The official
invitation made by the WGEID and Mr. Hegazy’s passport were confiscated as
evidence in the criminal case No. 900/2017 opened against him. The SSP ordered
the detention of Mr. Ibrahim Metwally Hegazy for 15 days pending
investigations, and sent him to the high security wing of Tora prison complex. 
 
Mr.
Metwally Hegazy is not the only member of the Association of the Families of
the Disappeared who has been targeted by the Egyptian authorities. Fellow
Co-founder Ms. Hanan Badr El-Din Othman, whose husband has been
missing since 2013, was arrested on May 6, 2017 while visiting a detainee in
Qanater Prison whom she hoped would have information about her husband’s
whereabouts. She remains in detention since that date.
 
Mr. Islam Salameh, another lawyer
who represents the forcibly disappeared families, was arrested by the security forces in March
2016. He was briefly held in incommunicado detention before being released in June 2016.
 
Mr. Ahmed Amasha, Co-founder
of the League for Families of the Disappeared, has been detained since March
10, 2017 without trial or a formal indictment in Tora Prison in Cairo. He also
disappeared during several days and was severely tortured.
 
The
Observatory expresses its utmost concern over the abduction and arbitrary
detention of Mr. Ibrahim Metwally Hegazy, as they appeared to be linked to his human rights
activities, and consequently urges the Egyptian
authorities to immediately allow him access to his lawyer and family, release
him and drop all the charges brought against him. 
 
The
Observatory recalls that arbitrary detentions and enforced disappearances have
become common practice in Egypt over the past few years targeting dissenting
voices, including human rights defenders.
