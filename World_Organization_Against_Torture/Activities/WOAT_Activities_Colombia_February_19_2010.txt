Last 23 December 2009 the national Government of Colombia declared a social emergency to cope with the financial crisis of the country's healthcare system. The measures adopted by the emergency health provisions will prevent the large majority of Colombians from enjoying a number of healthcare treatments that fall outside the Obligatory Health Plan (POS, Plan Obligatorio de Salud). In addition, new decree 128 provides that all persons shall pay their health assistance treatments that fall outside the above-mentioned POS through their own financial means, including through bank loans. The new policy will in particular have a discriminatory impact between those who can afford to pay medical treatments and those who cannot.
 
OMCT is deeply concerned that the new policy will put millions of Colombians trapped in the vicious cycle of poverty and disease, before the dilemma of choosing between their health and their daily livelihoods. OMCT is further concerned that the emergency rules limiting access to public healthcare will provoke fierce reactions from society and that this will give raise to serious violence across the country.
 
OMCT recalls that the International Covenant of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, “recognizes the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health” And that the Colombian Government has an international legal obligation to protect the lives, health, integrity and dignity of all their nationals, irrespective of their financial condition.  OMCT calls upon the Government of Colombia to revise this emergency policy and find different solutions to cope with financial crisis of health system. In particular OMCT calls upon the Government of Colombia to ensure that the poor and most vulnerable sectors of society are granted full access to health.-------For further information please contact: Tom McCarthy tmc@omct.org or Francesca Restifo, fr@omct.org
