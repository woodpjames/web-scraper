Description of the situation:  The Observatory has been informed that Mrs. Shirin Ebadi, 2003 Nobel Peace Prize and Secretary general of the Defenders of Human Rights Centre, an organisation established in 2002, was summoned on 12 January 2005 by the Revolutionary Public Prosecutor's office of Tehran.  The summons sent by the investigating judge n°14 does not specify why Mrs. Ebadi is summoned, but indicates that if she does not appear before the investigating judge within three days, she will be arrested in order to be brought to the investigating judge's office.  The Observatory is deeply concerned at the present situation since the Iranian judiciary is a tool of repression of dissenting voices and human rights defenders in the country.   The Observatory also notes with concern that Mrs. Ebadi has been subjected to various forms of harassment due to her human rights activities. In particular, during the last year, she received anonymous threatening letters and the door of her garage, in Tehran, was damaged several times. Although she expressed her fears for her security to the authorities, there has been no reaction up to now.    Action requested: Please write to the authorities of the Islamic Republic of Iran, urging them to:  i. Guarantee Mrs Ebadi's physical and psychological integrity in any circumstances.   ii. Clarify the reasons for Mrs Ebadi's summons and ensure that no judicial procedure is used in order to silence her.  iii. Conform with the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the United Nations' General Assembly on 9 December 1998, in particular its article 1, which states that " everyone has the right,  individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels ".  iv. Conform with the provisions of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, and with the international instruments ratified by the Islamic Republic of Iran.
