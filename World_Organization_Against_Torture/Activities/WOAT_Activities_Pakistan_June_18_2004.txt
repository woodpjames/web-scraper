Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Asian Human Rights Commission (AHRC), a member of the OMCT network, of the sexual abuse of a 6-year-old boy by his teacher in Pakistan on 6 June 2004.  In the afternoon of 6 June 2004, the victim’s mother went to the Lajna Mosque in Lahore, Punjab province, Pakistan, where her son studies, because he did not come back at home after school. When she arrived at the mosque, she found her son lying in the corridor, bleeding and unconscious. Although the alleged perpetrator was not in the mosque at that time, the victim clearly identified one of his teacher as his attacker when he came with his grandfather to the Green Town Police Station to file a complaint on 7 June 2004. Moreover, the initial medical report confirmed that the victim was sexually harassed. The alleged aggressor is currently detained at the Kot Lakhpat Jail.  However, the victim’s family reported that they are suffering pressure to withdraw the case from various religious groups, including the Tableeghi Jamaat and Jamia Ashrafia, and also from neighbours. Police investigators are allegedly pressured, too.  OMCT welcomes the arrest of the alleged perpetrator for the purpose of due investigation and process. OMCT would like to encourage the authorities of Pakistan to continue to act on this case, despite pressures, in compliance with article 19 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child which states that “(1) States Parties shall take all appropriate legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to protect the child from all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation, including sexual abuse, while in the care of parent(s), legal guardian(s) or any other person who has the care of the child. (2) Such protective measures should, as appropriate, include effective procedures for the establishment of social programmes to provide necessary support for the child and for those who have the care of the child, as well as for other forms of prevention and for identification, reporting, referral, investigation, treatment and follow-up of instances of child maltreatment described heretofore, and, as appropriate, for judicial involvement.”  Actions requested  Please write to the authorities in Pakistan urging them to:  i. Take all necessary measures to ensure the physical and psychological integrity of the victim; ii. Order a thorough and impartial investigation into the circumstances of this event in order to bring the responsible to trial and apply the penal and/or administrative sanctions as provided by law, even in the case where the victim withdraws his complaint; iii. put an immediate end to the pressure to which the victim’s family is being subjected; iv. guarantee that adequate reparation is provided to the victim and his family v. Guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
