The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint
programme of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World
Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent intervention in the
following situation in Burma. 
 
Brief description of the situation:
 
The Observatory has been informed by the Alternative ASEAN Network on
Burma (Altsean-Burma) about the killing of Mr. San
Tun, a land and
environmental rights defender and local leader of the National League for Democracy
(NLD), in Hopong Township, Shan State.
 
According to the information received, on June 4, 2014, at around midnight, Mr.
San Tun was taken from his home by two
unidentified men and gunshots were heard by neighbours a few minutes later.
 
On June 5, 2014, Mr. San Tun's body was found outside of
his village, with bullet holes in the back of his head and wounds on his hands.
Three casings and a flash light were found near his body.
 
The Observatory condemns in the strongest term the murder of Mr. San Tun, and fears that it is related to his
human rights activities. Indeed, Mr. San Tun helped local farmers to demand the
return of land that had been seized by the Burmese Army’s Light Infantry
Battalion (LIB) 249. Allegedly the LIB 249 said that it would return land to
villagers, but the headman of the
Ming Pyin village objected to the return of the land.
 
The case is currently under police investigation. 
 
The Observatory calls upon the authorities of Burma to carry out a thorough, effective, and impartial investigation
into Mr. San Tun’s murder in order to identify all those responsible,
bring them before a civil competent and impartial tribunal and apply the penal
sanctions provided by the law.
 
Actions requested:
 
Please write to the Burmese authorities urging them to:
 
i. Guarantee, in all circumstances, the physical and psychological
integrity of all human rights defenders in Burma;
 
ii. Order an
immediate, thorough, effective and impartial investigation into the murder of Mr.
San Tun in order to
identify all those responsible, bring them before a civil competent and
impartial tribunal and apply the penal sanctions provided by the law;
 
iii. Provide
adequate reparation to the relatives of Mr. San Tun;
 
iv. Put an end to any kind of harassment against all human rights
defenders in Burma
and ensure in all circumstances that they are able to carry out their
legitimate activities without any hindrance or fear of reprisals;
 
v. Comply with all the provisions of the Declaration on Human Rights
Defenders, adopted on December 9, 1998 by the United Nations General Assembly,
in particular:
- its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the
right, individually or in association with others, to promote the protection
and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and
international levels”, 
- and its Article 12.2 which provides that “the
State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the
competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others,
against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse
discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his
or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present
Declaration.”
 
vi. More generally, ensure the respect for human
rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights, and ratify international and regional human rights instruments.
