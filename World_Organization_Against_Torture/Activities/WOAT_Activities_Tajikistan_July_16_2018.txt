The Observatory for the Protection of
Human Rights Defenders, a partnership of FIDH and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), requests your
urgent intervention in the following situation in Tajikistan.
 
Description of the situation:
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources
about the arbitrary detention and sentencing of Mr. Khayrullo Mirsaidov, a journalist covering issues related to human
rights, the environment and national minorities. Prior to his arrest he had
reported about the corruption of local authorities in Tajikistan.
 
According to the information received, on July 11,
2018, Mr. Khayrullo Mirsaidov was sentenced to 12 years in high-security penal
colony. The Court of Khujand found Mr. Khayrullo Mirsaidov guilty of
“embezzlement of public funds” (Article 245.4 of the Criminal Code of
Tajikistan), “forgery of documents” (Article 340.1) and “dissemination of false
information” (Article 346.2). Mr. Khayrullo Mirsaidov will appeal the sentence.
 
On December 5, 2017, Mr. Khayrullo Mirsaidov was
summoned to the Prosecution Office of Sgod Province, where he was immediately
arrested. Criminal charges were filed against him on December 8, 2017,
allegedly on the basis of four articles and a public letter he had published
and in which he reported on the newly appointed head of the Sogd Province’s
Department of Youth and Sports, saying that the latter had extorted him a bribe
of approximatively 1,000 Euros. The Head of the Sogd Province’s Department of
Youth and Sports subsequently accused Mr. Mirsaidov to have embezzled the
funds. As of publication of this Urgent Appeal, he remained detained at the
pre-trial detention centre of Khujand, where he has been detained since his
arrest and where is allowed to see his family members once a month.
 
On July 11, 2018, the OSCE Representative on Freedom of the
Media “expressed
his concern about [this] excessive sentence”.
 
The Observatory condemns Mr. Khayrullo Mirsaidov’s
sentence and arbitrary detention, which seem aimed at hindering his peaceful and legitimate human rights work, in particular
for denouncing the corruption of local Tajik authorities.
 
The Observatory urges the authorities in Tajikistan to
immediately and unconditionally release Mr. Khayrullo Mirsaidov and to put an
end to all forms of harassment, including at the judicial level, against him as well as all human rights defenders in Tajikistan.

Actions requested:
 
Please write to the authorities in
Tajikistan asking them to:
 
i. Guarantee in all circumstances the
physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Khayrullo Mirsaidov as well as of all human rights defenders in Tajikistan;
 
ii. Immediately and unconditionally release
Mr. Khayrullo Mirsaidov, as his detention is arbitrary since it only aims at
punishing him for his legitimate human rights activities;
 
iii. Put an end to all forms of
harassment, including at the judicial level, against Mr. Khayrullo Mirsaidov
and all human rights defenders in
Tajikistan so they are able to carry out their work without
unjustified hindrance and fear of reprisal;
 
iv. Comply in all circumstances with all
the provisions of the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, in
particular its Articles 1 and 12.2;
 
v. More generally, ensure in all
circumstances the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in
accordance with international human rights standards and instruments.
