Joint Statement
 
As World
Press Freedom Day is celebrated across the globe on May 3, we, the undersigned
organizations, cannot forget the untenable price journalists pay for government
criticism in Azerbaijan. The case of Mehman
Huseynov is emblematic. Huseynov is a popular journalist and blogger in
Azerbaijan who is known for his hard-hitting exposés of alleged corruption by
senior Azerbaijani officials. In March 2017, a Baku court sentenced him to two
years in prison on charges of defaming an entire police station, after he gave
a statement in front of the courthouse in which he described the abuses he had
suffered at that police station.
 
On
January 9, a group of plain-clothes officers attacked Mehman Huseynov,
blindfolded and gagged him with towels, forced a bag over his head and took him
to the Nasimi district police station, where police used an electroshock weapon
on his groin, and punched him, bloodying his nose. The next day, officers took
him before a court that found him guilty of disobeying police orders and fined
him 200 manat (US$120).
 
Mehman Huseynov
remained defiant, went public about the abuses he suffered at the station, and
filed a complaint with the prosecutor’s office. The authorities formally opened
an inquiry into Huseynov’s allegations, but swiftly closed the inquiry claiming
the allegations were groundless. On April 27,  an appeal court upheld the prosecutor’s
decision to shut down the investigation. 
 
While
authorities refused to conduct a credible investigation into Huseynov’s torture
allegations, the Nasimi police chief brought a criminal lawsuit against him for
defamation. After just two hearings, a court found Huseynov guilty and sentenced
him to two years in prison.
 
Mehman Huseynov
has been targeted by the government for years, since the authorities brought
bogus criminal charges against the Institute for Reporters’ Freedom
and Safety (IRFS), founded by his brother, Emin Huseynov, who was forced to
flee the country for his own safety. Since 2012, Mehman Huseynov has
been under a travel ban and has been repeatedly harassed and
intimidated by the police.
 
The
imprisonment of Mehman  Huseynov is
another step by the Azerbaijani authorities to retaliate against him for his
critical journalism and defiance, but also to deter others from seeking justice
for police abuse, a persistent and well-documented problem in Azerbaijan. At
least 5 other journalists and bloggers are currently in prison on politically
motivated charges in Azerbaijan. 
 
On a day
when the world commemorates the fundamental importance of press freedom, we call
on the Azerbaijani authorities to immediately and unconditionally release Mehman
Huseynov and hold to account those responsible for the torture and other
ill-treatment he was subjected to. This would mark an important step towards ensuring
press freedoms and guaranteeing the right to freedom of expression in
Azerbaijan.
