Withdrawal of charges
Cambodia
June 5, 2012
 
The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of
the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation
Against Torture (OMCT), has received new information and requests your urgent
intervention in the following situation in Cambodia.
 
New
information:
 
The Observatory has been
informed by the Cambodian Human Rights and Development Association (ADHOC) of
the withdrawal of the charges faced by Mr. Soum Chankea, its Provincial Coordinator in Banteay
Meanchey province.
 
According to the
information received, the Deputy Prosecutor of the Provincial Court in Sisophon decided to drop, on May 8,
all the charges brought against Mr. Chankea. The latter was notified of the
decision by letter at the end of May.
 
While the Observatory
welcomes this positive development, it notes that the plaintiff, Mr. Oum
Socheath, may still lodge an appeal against this decision. 
 
Background information: 
 
On November 4 and 9,
2011 respectively, a woman filed complaints of sexual harassment and assault
against Mr. Oum Socheath, Head of the Banteay Meanchey branch of the Cambodia
Mine Action Centre (CMAC) and Coordinator of the UNDP-CMAC mine clearance
programme, and Mr. Thong Piseth, also known as Mr. Veth, a real estate and construction business
man.
 
As the authorities
allegedly took no action to investigate the woman’s allegations, Mr. Soum
Chankea, as ADHOC Provincial Coordinator, intervened several times on her behalf
and urged the police and the Prosecutor to investigate the case. According to information gathered by
ADHOC, Messrs. Oum Socheath and Thong Piseth were under the protection of a
businessman whose brother is a high-ranking government official. On February 22, 2012, local media reports revealed that Hun San, the brother of Cambodian
Prime Minister Hun Sen, signed a letter to the prosecutor in Sisophon asking
him not to investigate the complaints against Oum Socheath.
 
On February 9, 2012, Mr. Soum Chankea was summoned to appear on February 20,
 2012 before the
Prosecutor’s Office in Sisophon, capital of Banteay Meanchey province,
following a complaint lodged by Mr. Oum Socheath in which he accused ADHOC
Coordinator of forcing the victim to file a complaint against the two men. 
 
If the Prosecutor had
then decided to bring charges against Mr. Soum Chankea, they could  have included the charge of “slanderous
denunciation”, an offence punishable by up to one year in prison and up to two
million riels (380 Euros) fine under Article 311 of the Criminal Code. 
 
Actions requested:
 
Please write to the Cambodian authorities and ask them
to:
 
i.   Guarantee in all circumstances the physical
and psychological integrity of Mr.
Soum Chankea;
 
ii.  Put an end to acts of harassment - including at
the judicial level - against him as well as against all human rights defenders
in Cambodia;
 
iii.  Conform with the provisions of the Declaration
on Human Rights Defenders, adopted on December 9, 1998 by the United Nations
General Assembly, and in particular :
-      
Article
1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually or in association
with others, to promote the protection and realization of human rights and
fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, 
-    
 and Article 12.2 which provides that “the State
shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent
authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against
any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination,
pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her
legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”.
 
iv. Ensure in all
circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance
with international human rights standards and international instruments
ratified by Cambodia.
