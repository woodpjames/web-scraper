Brief description of the facts:The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources that Mr. Yang Maodong, alias Guo Feixiong, a lawyer and human right defender, was detained for 26 hours on February 9, 2006 in the Fuyou police station in Beijing. He was released on February 10, 2006, and escorted back home by three policemen. Since then, his house is being watched by the police and he is being followed by policemen whenever he goes out.  On February 3, 2006 Mr. Yang had already been detained in the Linhe police station in Guangzhou for 12 hours. He had been subsequently released on February 4, 2006 at 12.30 am. Before he left the building, he was dragged out  by a group of unidentified men who beat him violently and took the film. They reportedly twisted his arms and kicked his lower back in front of some policemen who did nothing to defend him.  The Observatory believes that these arrests are connected to Mr. Yang’s involvement in defending the rights of the Taishi villagers in the framework of their struggle against the corruption of a local civil servant.  Indeed, in July 2005, Mr. Yang  started to give legal assistance to villagers in Taishi, who were trying to obtain the dismissal of Mr. Chen Jinsheng, the elected chief of the village committee suspected of corruption. Following the government’s refusal to accept their requests, the villagers staged sit-ins and hunger strikes. Since mid-September 2005, the local government decided to take coercive measures against the demonstrations: dozens of villagers were arrested and many got injured. Mr. Yang posted online comments about these events.    Mr. Yang had also been arrested in Guangzhou on September 13, 2005 and held incommunicado until October 4, 2005 when his lawyers were notified of his arrest and the charges against him (“assembling crowds to disturb public order”). While in detention, Mr. Yang, who was not allowed to meet his lawyers, carried out a 59-day hunger strike and he was fed by doctors against his will. He was released without charge on December 27, 2005.   Furthermore, Mr. Tang Jingling, a lawyer who helped, along with Mr. Yang, the Taishi villagers in filing their procedures, was harassed and beaten on February 2, 2006, while he was on his way back home after visiting Mr. Yang. Five unidentified men follow him and then beat him violently. After having reported what happened to a police station, he was followed all his way home by two taxis.  Actions required:Please write to the Chinese authorities urging them to: i. Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Yang Maodong and Mr. Tang Jingling;   ii. Put an end to all acts of harassment against them as well as all other human rights defenders in China;  iii. Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, article 6(b), which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others (...) to publish, impart or disseminate to others views, information and knowledge on all human rights and fundamental freedoms”, and its article 8(2), which provides that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to submit to governmental bodies and agencies and organisations concerned with public affairs criticism and proposals for improving their functioning and to draw attention to any aspect of their work that may hinder or impede the promotion, protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms”;  iv. Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by the People’s Republic of China.
