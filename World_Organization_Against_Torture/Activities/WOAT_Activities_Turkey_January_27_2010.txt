Ongoing arbitrary detention / Judicial harassment
Turkey
January 27, 2010
The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), has received new information and requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in Turkey.
New information:
The Observatory has been informed by the Human Rights Association (İnsan Haklari Derneği - İHD) about the forthcoming second court hearing in the trial against Ms. Filiz Kalayci, lawyer and İHD Executive Committee member currently arbitrarily detained, as well as against Messrs. Hasan Anlar, İHD Executive Committee member, Halil İbrahim Vargün and Murat Vargün, İHD lawyers and members.
According to the information received, Ms. Filiz Kalayci and Messrs. Hasan Anlar, Halil İbrahim Vargün and Murat Vargün are to appear on January 28, 2010 at 14:00 before the 11th Heavy Penal Court of Ankara reportedly for “aiding illegal organisations” in a move that manifestly aims at hindering their human rights activities (See background information).
The Observatory calls for the full respect of fair trial standards in the framework this hearing and urges the Turkish authorities to put an immediate end to the judicial harassment against Ms. Filiz Kalayci and Messrs. Hasan Anlar, Halil İbrahim Vargün and Murat Vargün, which seems to merely aim at sanctioning their human rights activities.
The Observatory also calls upon the Delegation of the European Commission in Ankara and embassies of European Union member States to visit Ms. Filiz Kalayci in detention and observe the forthcoming court hearing, in accordance with the Guidelines of the European Union on Human Rights Defenders.
The Observatory recalls that Ms. Filiz Kalayci was arrested on May 28, 2009. Since then, she has remained detained in the women prison of Ankara. Accordingly, the Observatory urges the Turkish authorities to release Ms. Filiz Kalayci immediately and unconditionally as her detention seems to merely aim at sanctioning her human rights activities.
Background information:
On May 12, 2009, in Ankara, the offices and homes of Ms. Filiz Kalayci, Mr. Hasan Anlar, Mr. Halil İbrahim Vargün and Mr. Murat Vargün were raided by officers of the Anti-Terror Unit of the police, who were in possession of a search warrant and a detention order against them. They were immediately arrested, placed in police custody in the Anti-Terror Forces Unit detention centre, and released in the night of May 14, 2009. According to their lawyers, the Public Prosecutor brought Ms. Filiz Kalayci, Mr. Hasan Anlar, Mr. Halil Ibrahim Vargun and Mr. Murat Vargun before the 11th district High Criminal Court of Ankara and requested that they be remanded in detention. However, the court decided to release Ms. Filiz Kalayci, Mr. Hasan Anlar, Mr. Halil Ibrahim Vargun and Mr. Murat Vargun, but imposed a travel ban on them,on the basis of Article 109 of the Code of Criminal Procedure or CMK No. 5271 dated 2004, which is still in force except for Mr. Murat Vargun.
The Public Prosecutor appealed the decision, and issued a warrant of arrest against Ms. Filiz Kalayci on May 25, 2009. On May 28, 2009, Ms. Filiz Kalayci was arrested on the basis of an allegation of “aiding illegal organisations". Messrs. Hasan Anlar, Halil İbrahim Vargün and Murat Vargün were also subject to the same allegations but not arrested.
These acts of harassment intervened after the publication by İHD of a report on human rights violations in prisons of Turkey on February 6, 2009 and made it public to draw attention on these violations. İHD had shared this report with the authorities. In addition, Ms. Filiz Kalayci, Mr. Hasan Anlar, Mr. Halil İbrahim Vargün and Mr. Murat Vargün had been working on cases of human rights violations that occurred in detention, and as a consequence they often received letters of complaint from prison inmates.
The first hearing of Ms. Kalayci and of Messrs. Hasan Anlar, Halil İbrahim Vargün and Murat Vargün was held on November 9, 2009 before the 11th district High Criminal Court of Ankara. Although the defence lawyers claimed that the accusation of the Prosecutor against IHD lawyers and members was unfair and the evidence was both illegal and insufficient, the court rejected the petition and the hearing was adjourned until January 28, 2010.
