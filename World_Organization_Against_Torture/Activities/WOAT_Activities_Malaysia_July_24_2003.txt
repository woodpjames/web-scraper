New Information  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Asian Human Rights Commission (AHRC), a member of the OMCT network, that on 18 July 2003 police forces disrupted a peaceful demonstration and arrested and beat participant Syahrir Mahmood as the crowd of around 300 protesters marched to the Magistrate Court, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.    According to the information received, on 18 July 2003 a group of around 300 demonstrators gathered at the Kuala Lumpur National Mosque and planned to march to the Magistrate Court in support of a group of students, known as the ISA7, who were facing trial for their participation in a June 2001 demonstration against the 1960 Internal Security Act (ISA).  It is reported that a large police force, led by Chief Inspector of the District Police Hadi Ho Abdullah, intervened and used force against the participants just as the march was beginning.  Mr. Hadi Ho Abdullah reportedly took a position that the march was illegal and that there would be no negotiations about continuing the march and then gave the demonstrators no time to disperse.    According to the information received Mr. Syahrir Mahmood, a spokesperson for the Students Abolish ISA Movement (Gabungan Mahasiswa Mansuhkan ISA, or GMMI), attempted to negotiate with the police to allow the group time to disperse, but these efforts were rebuffed.  It is reported that seven uniformed police officers later grabbed Mr. Mahmood, sprayed his eyes with tear gas, causing him to nearly lose consciousness, and struck him several times on the head and back.  It is reported that Mr. Mahmood suffered bruises on his head and that his neck was bleeding and swollen.  The police reportedly continued to strike Mr. Mahmood after he was handcuffed.  It is reported that Mr. Mahmood was arrested and brought to the Jalan Stadium Road Police Station (also known as Tun H.S. Lee Police Station), then released on police bail at approximately 7:30 p.m.   Background information  According to the information received, the aforementioned march is part of a larger effort to support the ISA7 in getting the charges against them dropped and to get them reinstated to their universities.  The seven students were arrested on 8 June 2001 for their participation in a demonstration against the 1960 Internal Security Act.  After being detained overnight at the Jalan Stadium Road Police Station, they were charged with illegal assembly under the 1967 Police Act and suspended from their universities under the 1971 Universities and University Colleges Act.    It is reported that these students, who have been suspended from their universities for over two years, have been unable to find jobs and are suffering from the strain of the lengthy legal process resulting from the charges.  The students have reportedly been required to attend at least 6 hearings regarding the charges against them.  At the time of the march, the students were scheduled to stand trial on the criminal charges from July 7th to July 14th 2003 in Kuala Lumpur Magistrate Court.  It is reported that their trial is scheduled to resume on 27 October 2003.   Action requested  Please write to the authorities in Malaysia urging them to:  i.
