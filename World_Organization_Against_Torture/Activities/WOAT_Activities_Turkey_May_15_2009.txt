New information: The Observatory has been informed by the Human Rights Association (İnsan Haklari Derneği - İHD) about the release of the four human rights lawyers, Mr. Hasan Anlar, İHD Deputy Secretary General, Ms. Filiz Kalayci, İHD Executive Committee member, Mr. Halil İbrahim Vargün, İHD former treasurer, and Mr. Murat Vargün. According to the information received, the four lawyers, who were detained since May 12, 2009, were released in the night of May 14, 2009. According to their lawyers, the Public Prosecutor brought Mr. Hasan Anlar, Ms. Filiz Kalayci, Mr. Halil Ibrahim Vargun and Mr. Murat Vargun before the 11th district High Criminal Court of Ankara and requested that they be remanded in detention. However, the court decided to release the four lawyers, but imposed a travel ban on them, on the basis of Article 109 of the Code of Criminal Procedure or CMK No. 5271 dated 2004. Pursuant to the ban, the four lawyers are not allowed to leave the country, as long as the proceedings are ongoing. Once the Public Prosecutor has closed its investigation, the court will decide on whether to indict the four lawyers and start a trial. The Observatory welcomes the release of Mr. Hasan Anlar, Ms. Filiz Kalayci, Mr. Halil Ibrahim Vargun and Mr. Murat Vargun and wishes to thank all the persons, organisations, and institutions that intervened in their behalf. Nevertheless, the Observatory expresses its concern about the ongoing judicial harassment faced by them. Background information: On May 12, 2009, in Ankara, the offices and homes of Mr. Hasan Anlar, Ms. Filiz Kalayci, Mr. Halil İbrahim Vargün and Mr. Murat Vargün were raided by officers of the Anti-Terror Unit of the police, who were in possession of a search warrant and a detention order against them. The four lawyers were immediately arrested and placed in police custody in the Anti-Terror Forces Unit detention centre. The terms of the detention order remained unknown as of issuing this urgent appeal. In accordance with the Code of Criminal Procedure or CMK No. 5271 dated 2004, their lawyers have not been allowed to access the police investigation file yet, but charges faced by the four human rights defenders included the offence of “aiding an illegal organisation”. This crackdown intervened after the İHD published on February 6, 2009 a report on human rights violations in prisons of Turkey and made it public to draw attention on these violations. İHD has shared this report with the authorities. In addition, the four lawyers had been working on cases of human rights violations that occurred in detention, and as a consequence they often received letters of complaint from prison inmates.
