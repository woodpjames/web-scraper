The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a partnership of the
World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and FIDH, requests your urgent
intervention in the following situation in Cambodia.
 
Brief
description of the situation:
 
The
Observatory has been informed about the arbitrary arrest and pre-trial detention
of Messrs. Hun
Vannak and Doem Kundy,
two members
of the grassroots environmental rights organisation ‘Mother Nature Cambodia’,
for filming two
suspected sand-bearing large vessels anchored off the coast of Prek Ksach
commune, in Koh Kong province.
 
According to the information
received, on September 12, 2017, at 10:45 am, Messrs.
Hun
Vannak and Doem Kundy were arrested as they were on a small
speedboat off the coast of Koh Kong province, and were taken to Koh Kong
provincial police headquarters for questioning. They had just finished filming two large vessels
that were suspected to be ready to carry silica sand for export. The video was
aimed at asking prominent businessman and ruling Cambodian People’s
Party (CPP) Senator Ly
Yong Phat[1],
who owns the nearby Special Economic Zone where the sand had been extracted
from, why the ships appeared not to be broadcasting an Automatic Identification
System signal, meaning they did not appear on online ship tracking databases. The police were
reportedly acting on a complaint issued by the company
Kirisakor
Koh Kong S.E.Z, under the
control of Ly Yong Phat Group Co Ltd., which claimed that the activists were filming “inside the
company’s private land”.
 
On
September 13, 2017, Messrs.
Hun Vannak and Doem Kundy were interviewed by Koh Kong Prosecutor
without any lawyer present. Koh Kong Provincial Court subsequently
charged them
with “incitement to commit a felony” and “violation of privacy (recording
of a person’s image)” (Article 302 of the Criminal Code). If found guilty of
these charges, they could face up to three years in prison.
 
Both
Messrs. Hun Vannak and Doem Kundy were subsequently
placed in pre-trial
detention in Prek Svay prison, Khmerak Phumin city, Koh Kong province, where
they remained detained as of issuing this Urgent Appeal. They now have access to
a lawyer.
 
Messrs. Hun
Vannak and Doem Kundy’s arrest happened a day after Mother Nature
Cambodia had published a video online
exposing huge discrepancies in silica sand trade figures with Taiwan,
highlighting more than $30 million in undocumented and potentially illegal
exports. The video has been viewed 1.1 million times, and shared more than
57,000 times on Facebook. Mother Nature has
repeatedly sought to expose discrepancies in trade figures between Cambodia and
third countries, including India and Singapore, which would indicate large
scale sand smuggling. The Observatory believes that this video might
be the real reason behind the arrest of Messrs. Hun Vannak and Doem Kundy.
 
The
Observatory recalls that several Mother Nature Cambodia members have faced legal action and have
been harassed and imprisoned for their campaigning against illicit sand dredging in Koh Kong Province[2]. 
 
The
Observatory strongly condemns the arbitrary arrest and pre-trial detention of Messrs. Hun
Vannak and Doem Kundy, which only aim at punishing them for their legitimate human rights
activities. The Observatory calls on the Cambodian authorities to immediately
and unconditionally release Messrs. Hun Vannak and Doem Kundy and to put an end to all acts of
harassment against then and all human rights defenders in Cambodia.
 
Actions
requested:
 
Please
write to the authorities of Cambodia asking them to:
 
i.
Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Messrs. Hun
Vannak and Doem Kundy as well as of all human rights defenders in Cambodia;
 
ii. Immediately and unconditionally release Messrs. Hun
Vannak and Doem Kundy, as well as all detained human rights defenders in
Cambodia, as their detention is arbitrary since it only aims at punishing
them for their legitimate human rights activities;
 
iii. Put
an end to all forms of harassment, including at the judicial level,
against Messrs. Hun
Vannak and Doem Kundy and all human rights defenders in the country so that they are able to
carry out their work without hindrance;
 
iv. Comply
with all the provisions of the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights
Defenders, adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 9, 1998, in
particular with its Articles 1 and 12.2;

with the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and other international human
rights instruments signed or ratified by the Kingdom of Cambodia.
