According to the information received from reliable sources, on October 13th, 2001, the Criminal Court of Misurata sentenced Mr. Ali Mansour Mhemmed Al-Guinaidy to the amputation of his right arm. The sentence was apparently based on Law N° 148 of 1972 (on Theft) which had never been applied until this case. The amputation was reportedly carried out on June 23rd, 2002, at Misurata’s central hospital, in the presence of the Libyan National Television, which filmed the whole procedure. An edited version of this video was reportedly recently broadcast by satellite television.  OMCT deems that amputation constitutes torture under all circumstances, because this practice inherently causes severe pain and suffering. Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture defines “torture” as “…any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person”. The permanent mental pain and physical incapacitation resulting from such penalties clearly violate international human rights standards that prohibit the use of torture, whether or not such procedures are carried out under anaesthetics.
