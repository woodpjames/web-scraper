OBSERVATORY

Arbitrary detention
Belarus
June 2, 2017
 
The Observatory for the
Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a partnership of FIDH and the World
Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent intervention in the
following situation in Belarus.
 
Description of the situation:
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable
sources about the re-arrest and arbitrary detention of Mr. Pavel
Levinau, human rights defender and board member of the Belarusian Helsinki
Committee.
 
According
to the information received, on the evening of May 30, 2017, police officers
arrested Mr. Pavel Levinau in Viciebsk and placed him in detention at the
temporary detention facility in Viciebsk. On April 17, 2017, Judge Ina
Hrabouskaya of the Kastryčnicki district of Viciebsk sentenced him to 15 days
of administrative detention under article 23.34 of the Code of Administrative
Offences for participating in an unauthorised protests on March 2 and 26, 2017
(see background information). The judgment against Mr. Pavel Levinau was handed down in absentia, as he was
receiving treatment outside Belarus.
 
On May
5, after returning to Belarus, Mr. Pavel Levinau had been arrested by the
police and detained until May 10, when he was taken to hospital due to high
blood pressure, and later underwent a surgery, before he was finally discharged
from the hospital.
 
The Observatory
expresses its deepest concern with the conviction and detention of Mr. Levinau,
as they appear to be linked to his human rights activities. Mr. Levinau notably
observed the violations and arbitrary detentions which occurred in March 2017,
within the framework of peaceful protests opposing Presidential Decree No. 3 “On the prevention of dependency on
social aid” (see background information).
 
The
Observatory therefore urges Belarusian authorities to immediately and
unconditionally release Mr. Pavel Levinau and to put an end to all forms of
harassment, including at the judicial level, against him.
 
Background information:
 
Since the beginning of March, 2017, peaceful
protests have erupted throughout the country to oppose President Decree n.° 3
“On the prevention of dependency on social aid” which in violation of
international human rights law sanctions unemployment by imposing a penalty
ranging from a fee to imprisonment on Belarusian citizens who have worked less
than a certain number of days.
 
Peaceful protests were
massively repressed with hundreds of protesters detained by the police[1].
 
Belarusian authorities arrested several human
rights defenders who have been sentenced under article 23.34 of the Code of
Administrative Offences for “participating in an unauthorised peaceful
assembly” in reprisal for their legitimate monitoring activities of observing
massive violations and arbitrary detention of peaceful protesters[2].
 
Amongst them, Mr. Pavel Levinau was arrested on March 26, 2017, for taking part in protests held in
Vitebsk on March 25 and 26 as an observer. Suffering from a heart problem, his
blood pressure increased while in detention, causing a hypertensive crisis.
