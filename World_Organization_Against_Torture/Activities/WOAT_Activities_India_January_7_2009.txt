Brief description of the situation The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by MASUM, a member of SOS-Torture network, of the assault of Master Sujit Bala by Border Security Force (BSF) officers on October 19, 2008 in front of his house in the village of Biswaspara, West Bengal, and, of the continuous threat against him and his family. Master Sujit Bala was 16 years old when the facts occurred. According to the information received, on 19 October 2008 at about 5:45 p.m., five BFS officers, including identified Assistant Commandant Bhagat Singh Rana from Angrail BSF Camp, came to Master Sujit Bala’s house, forcibly took him out and started beating him. The victim was severely kicked and punched, including with rifle butts, all over his body. The beatings only stopped when the boy felt unconscious. At that time, the BSF officers left him bleeding, in front of his house. Then, according to the same information, some villagers, including victim’s brother, took Master Sujit Bala to Jiban Deep Nursing Home from where he was rapidly transferred to Sub-divisional hospital of Bongaon where he received stitches for injuries on his head and on his left hand. He remained hospitalized until 23 October. MASUM also reported that the victim’s mother, Ms. Jharna Bala, lodged a first complaint at Gaighata police station on 19 October 2008 against the BSF officers considered responsible. According to the information received, this was not registered as a formal criminal complaint but simply recorded in the General Diary of the police station (entry n° 943/2008 dated 19.10.2008). Furthermore, on October 20, Ms. Bala lodged further written complaints before the highest representatives of the police administration in the district (i.e. Superintendent of police, Sub-Divisional Officer and Sub-Divisional Police Officer). No action was taken until Ms. Bala received a letter dated 30 December 2008 where the Sub-Divisional Officer informed her that Gaighata police station had started a case n°431 under sections 341, 325, 34 and 506 of the Indian Penal Code and was proceeding to an investigation. In addition to alleged procedural irregularities, there are suspicions that the police voluntarily lowered the level of gravity of the acts and consequently charged the BSF officers with bailable offences. Until now, no action has been taken against the perpetrators. Moreover, since she lodged complaints, Ms. Jharna Bala and her sons have been frequently threatened. For example, on 25 October 2008 around 9 a.m., several BSF officers came into her house and tried to forcibly take her elder son away. Thanks to strong resistance by the local residents, they failed. When the officers left the place, they threatened the Bala family, including with death, because of the complaints they had lodged. It should be mentioned also that 15-20 days prior Master Sujit’s assault, some BSF officers entered Balas’ house while they were chasing smugglers close to that place, and asked the victim’s brothers whether they had seen the smugglers. Being unable to answer, the victim’s brothers were slapped on their face by the BSF officers and, when their mother protested, the officers threatened the family with serious consequences in the near future. One may deduce from this incident that Master Sujit Bala’s assault was premeditated. The International Secretariat of the OMCT and MASUM are gravely concerned about this incident that adds to a series of similar cases of assaults and extra-judicial killings of civilians, including children, committed by the Border Security Force in West Bengal. In most cases, the impunity of the perpetrators prevails.
