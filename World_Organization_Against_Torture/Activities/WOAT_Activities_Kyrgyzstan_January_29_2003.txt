According to the information received from the Coalition for  Democracy and Civil Society, as a result of the attention that has  been given in the media to this issue and following interviews given  by NGO leaders to the television and newspapers, the authorities are  orchestrating a campaign to instill fear in all persons who signed  this and other appeals protesting against the Referendum. According  to our sources, several of them have being summoned by the state  authorities and secret service representatives in order to sign  letters in which they deny their previous position on the Referendum.  Further to this, the Observatory has been informed that, on January  27, an officer of the criminal investigation department of Pervomai  police unit, M. Abylgaziev Roman, visited the neighbours of Mrs.  Aziza Abdrasulova, a Coalition member in Bishkek, and questioned them  about her family's lifestyle and social activities. In the absence of  her parents, Mrs. Abdrasulova's 12-year-old daughter was interrogated  about where her and her younger brother go to school.    The Observatory is gravely concerned by these acts of intimidation  and the reported pressure that is being applied to NGO leaders for  using their right to the freedom of expression and urges the Kyrgyz  authorities to ensure that the acts of harassment to which Ms.  Abdrasulova and other colleagues are being subjected are immediately  halted.  The Observatory calls on the authorities to guarantee, under all  circumstances, the security, and physical and psychological integrity  of all activists involved in the defence of Human Rights in  Kyrgyzstan and to conform with the provisions of the Declaration on  Human Rights Defenders adopted by the United Nations General Assembly  on 9  December 1998, notably its article 1 which states that "everyone has  the right, individually or in association with others, to promote and  to strive for the protection and  realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national  and international levels," and its article 12.2 which states that  "the State shall take all necessary  measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of  everyone, individually and in association with others, against any  violence, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination,  pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her  legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present  Declaration."  We thank you for your careful consideration in this matter.  Yours sincerely,    Sidiki KABA			                Eric SOTTAS President of the FIDH				Director of the OMCT
