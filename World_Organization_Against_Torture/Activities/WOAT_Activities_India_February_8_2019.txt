​IND 003 / 0219 / OBS 013HarassmentIndiaFebruary 8, 2019The Observatory for the Protection of
Human Rights Defenders, a partnership of the World Organisation Against Torture
(OMCT) and FIDH, requests your urgent intervention in the following situation
in India.Brief description
of the information:The Observatory has been informed by Banglar Manabadhikar Suraksha
Mancha (MASUM)[1]
about acts of harassment and intimidation by personnel of the Border Security Force (BSF) against Ms. Shila
Bewa, a member of MASUM, in
Toltoli village, in Ghospara Gram Panchayat, Murshidabad district, West Bengal
State, close to the border with Bangladesh.According to the information received, at around noon on January 25,
2019, Ms. Shila Bewa was verbally
harassed and intimidated by Mr. Tejbir, an
officer of the BSF 43rd Battalion posted at the Farajipara Border Outpost (BOP) while putting up posters
as part of a campaign protesting against violations committed by the BSF[2],
around the river bank areas of Toltoli village. Mr. Tejbir also confiscated all
posters that were in her bags and tore several posters that had already been
pasted on walls. At 3.30pm on the same day, when Ms. Bewa went to the Jalangi police station,
Murshidabad district, to file a complaint, the officer-in-charge initially
refused to register her complaint and blamed her for getting herself
into trouble, before finally accepting to take her complaint. When she returned
the next day to the police station to get a receipt for her complaint, the
Officer-in-Charge verbally harassed her, telling her that she “can’t do
anything against the BSF. We will not take any step against the BSF” and that “Kirity
Roy of MASUM cannot do anything against the police and the BSF”.Moreover,
on January 27, 2019, Mr. Tejbir interrupted a street corner meeting convened by
villagers at Raipara, in Ghospara Gram Panchayat, to protest against the BSF’s
attacks on freedom of expression of the people living along the border, which
specifically denounced Ms. Shila Bewa’s recent harassment. While the gathered
villagers asked Mr. Tejbir about his involvement in the removal of posters, he
took photographs of Mr. Kirity Roy, MASUM Secretary, who was addressing the
crowd at the time. As the gathering was getting restless, the BSF personnel
left. However, later, at around 7.30 pm, 15 police and BSF personnel from the
Jalangi police station and Farajipara BSF Camp, including Mr. Tejbir, came back
to where the meeting had taken place, forcing one villager to remove one of the
posters denouncing BSF violations and threatening villagers that any type of
protest against the police and the BSF would not be tolerated.The Observatory condemns the above-mentioned acts of harassment and intimidation
against Ms. Shila Bewa, which seem to be only aimed at punishing her for
denouncing grave human rights violations allegedly involving members of the
BSF, and recalls that several other members of MASUM have been facing reprisals
in the past for their human rights activities[3].
The Observatory calls upon the Indian authorities to put an end to all
acts of harassment, intimidation, and criminalization of all MASUM members, as
well as of all human rights defenders in India.Actions requested: Please write to the authorities in India, urging them to:i. Guarantee, in all circumstances, the physical integrity and
psychological well-being of all the members of MASUM as well as of all
human rights defenders in India;ii. Put an end to all acts of harassment - including at the judicial
level - against all the members of MASUM, as well as
against all human rights defenders in India, and ensure that they are able
to carry out their legitimate activities without any hindrance and fear of
reprisals in all circumstances;iii. Conform to the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights
Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9,
1998, in particular with Articles 1 and 12.2;iv. Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental
freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and
international instruments ratified by India.Addresses: ·
