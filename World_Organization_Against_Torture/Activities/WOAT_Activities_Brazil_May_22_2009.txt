The term “criminalization of poverty” refers to a clear and observable phenomenon that sees the poorest members of Brazilian society identified by state and quasi-state actors as criminal, or potentially criminal elements simply because of their socio-economic status and on that basis being targeted for extortion, arbitrary arrest and detention, physical violence or, indeed, summary execution.
