Description of the facts: The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources of the arrest of Ms. Sarah Wykes, a British citizen and a senior campaigner of Global Witness, an organisation working on the links between the exploitation of natural resources, the conflicts and human rights. According to the information received, on February 18, 2007, Ms. Wykes was arrested by the police in Cabinda,  where she remains detained. Indeed, at 4 am, police officers came to her hotel room, and seized a number of her personal belongings, including her passport, a digital camera, two pen drives and a notebook. As the policemen did not have any warrant, Ms. Wykes refused to follow them. As a result, she was formally arrested and brought to the police station. She then spent the night in jail and was brought to court on February 19, 2007, without being allowed to meet her lawyer. On February 20, 2007, her release on bail for an amount of US$ 2,000 was reportedly discussed, but the Attorney General in Cabinda has not yet signed the necessary papers as of the date of issuing this urgent appeal. The bail conditions also remain unclear. Ms. Wykes should appear in Court again on February 21, 2007. Yet, the Observatory is not aware of any charge against her. Ms. Wykes had arrived in Angola on February 11, 2006 to meet with civil society and local authorities, to discuss the process of transparency in oil revenues in Angola. The Angolan authorities were fully aware of the visit of Ms. Wykes and had granted her a visa. The Observatory expresses its deep concern regarding Mrs. Wykes’ detention, and considers it as arbitrary, as it appears to be aimed at sanctioning her human rights activities. The Observatory further urges the Angolan authorities to release her immediately. Action requested: Please write to the Angolan authorities urging them to:  Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Ms. Sarah Wykes; Release her immediately and unconditionally since her detention is arbitrary; Return her passport and the personal belongings that were seized by the police; Put an end to all acts of harassment against human rights defenders; Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels” and article 12.2, which states that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”; Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by Angola.
