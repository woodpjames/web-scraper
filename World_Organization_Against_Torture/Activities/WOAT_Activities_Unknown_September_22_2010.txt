The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), has received new information and requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in Iran.
New information:
The Observatory has been informed of the sentencing to prison of Mr. Emadeddin (Emad) Baghi, founder of the Centre for the Defence of Prisoners' Rights and laureate of the 2009 Martin Ennals Award for Human Rights Defenders as well as laureate of the 2005 Human Rights Prize of the French Republic.
According to the information received, on September 21, 2010, Mr. Emad Baghi was summoned by Branch 1057 of the Tehran Revolutionary Court regarding the closure in 2009 of the Centre for the Defence of Prisoners' Rights. He was then informed that on August 17, 2010 he had been sentenced by the Branch 26 of the Revolutionary Court to six years of imprisonment on charges of “propaganda against the system” and “colluding against the security of the regime” in relation to an interview with the late Grand Ayatollah Hussein-Ali Montazeri (see background information).
On July 27, Mr. Baghi was also sentenced by the Branch 15 of the Revolutionary Court to one year of prison and five years of deprivation of civil activities in another case for heading the Centre for the Defence of Prisoners' Rights, and is to serve a total of seven years in prison. As to date, he remained under provisional release.
The Observatory expresses its deep concern about the sentencing of Mr. Baghi, which seem to merely aim at sanctioning his human rights activities, in a context of constant harassment against human rights lawyers and activists in Iran.
The Observatory recalls that this sentence intervenes as other human rights defenders, journalists and student activists have been sentenced to harsh prison sentences over the last few days.[1]

During his detention, he reportedly spent five months out of his six-months in solitary confinement, and has been suffering from heart and breathing problems, as well as of severe back pain.
On June 23, 2010, Mr. Emad Baghi was released on health grounds, and following the payment of a bail of about 200,000 dollars.
