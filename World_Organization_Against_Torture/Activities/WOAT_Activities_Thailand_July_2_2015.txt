If found guilty of sedition, the student activists face up to seven years in prison. In addition, they face up to six months in prison and a fine of up to 10,000 baht (US$312) if found guilty of violating NCPO Order No. 3/2015.At 0.30 am on June 27, 2015, the Bangkok Military Court granted the remand in custody of the 14 student activists for 12 days (which can be extended to up to 48 days with renewals of 12 days at a time). The 13 men are detained at the Bangkok Remand Prison, and Ms. Chonticha Chaengreo is held at the Woman Correctional Institution. On July 7, the Bangkok Military Court will decide whether to extend their detention or release them.Ms. Sirikan together with seven other TLHR colleagues were on duty and assisted as lawyers the 14 students at Bangkok’s Phrarachawang Police Station and the Bangkok Military Court.Shortly after the hearing, more than 10 police officers stationed by the Bangkok Militarty Court, including Pol. Maj. Gen. Chayapol Chatchaidej, commander of the Sixth Division of Metropolitan Police Bureau, requested access to Ms. Sirikan's car to search for the mobile phones of the 14 activist students. Following Ms. Sirikan's refusal due to the lack of a court warrant and to the special protection of lawyers and of the lawyer-client confidentiality, the police officers arbitrarily seized Ms. Sirikan’s car by locking one of her car wheels and sealing all doors with A4 papers and duck-tape, and surrounding it with iron fences. Fearing that her clients’ belongings as well as the lawyers’ laptops and case files could be removed from the car, the group of TLHR lawyers decided to stay over-night to watch the car.At 12:45 pm on the same day, Ms. Sirikan went to a police station to file a complaint against the police for “malfeasance” under Article 157 of Thai Criminal Code regarding the illegal confiscation of her car. Before the complaint was accepted, another police team arrived at 3:30 pm where the car was parked, with a search warrant and officials from the Office of Police Forensic Science to conduct the search.Once a search warrant had been presented, Ms. Sirikan accepted to open her car. Equipment found in the car included TLHR’s case files, personal computers of the seven lawyers and personal belongings of the student activists including mobile phones. Five mobile phones belonging to the students were forfeited. As the search was taking place, one police official took five mobile phones outside of the crime scene. Fifteen minutes later, he returned with five mobile phones and put them into an envelope and sealed it. The envelope was then taken to the Office of Police Forensic Science.At approximately 6 pm, Ms. Sirikan went back to Chanasongkram Police Station in Bangkok, to bring a complaint against the Sixth Division of Metropolitan Police Bureau Commander Pol. Maj. Gen. Chayapol Chatchaidej and his subordinates for “malfeasance”. Ms. Sirikan and her colleague were then called into the chief police investigator’s room where he discussed that the police had powers to search her car and suggested that if she filed a suit, the police would file a counter suit against her. Despite these threats, at 11 pm, Ms. Sirikan decided to file a complaint for “malfeasance” and the police finally accepted to record the complaint.On June 28, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Pol Lt Gen Srivara Rangsipramkul told reporters that important evidence had been found in Ms. Sirikan’s car and that the police was considering whether or not to press charges against her. The interview took place before the seized mobile phones had been examined by forensic police, which was scheduled for June 29, 2015, and had to wait for a TLHR lawyer to witness the opening of sealed envelopes containing the five phones.Finally, on June 29, the police visited the house of Ms. Sirikan’s parents in her hometown and asked her mother to identify her in various photos and asked about her daughter’s background.The Observatory strongly condemns the judicial harassment against the 14 student activists as well as the threats and the harassment against Ms. Sirikan, which only aim at sanctioning their legitimate human rights activities.The Observatory calls on the Thai authorities to drop all charges against the 14 student activists, put an end to the threats and harassment of Ms. Sirikan, and repeal NCPO Orders that fail to comply with human rights standards.Actions requested:Please write to the authorities of Thailand asking them to:i. Immediately and unconditionally release the 14 student activists and put an end to all acts of judicial harassment against them and all human rights defenders in Thailand; ii. Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of the 14 student activists, and of Ms. Sirikan, as well of as all human rights defenders in Thailand; iii. Comply with the national and international legislation safeguarding the independence of lawyers and protecting them from unlawful interference in their professional activities; iv. Order a prompt, thorough and impartial investigation into the harassment of Ms. Sirikan in order to identify those responsible, bring them to trial and apply the penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions as provided by law; v.

Guarantee that the exercise of freedom of expression and assembly are not prosecuted under Section 116 of the Thai Criminal Code; vii.
