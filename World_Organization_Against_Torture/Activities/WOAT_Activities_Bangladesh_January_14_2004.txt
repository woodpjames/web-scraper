Description of the situation:  The Observatory has been informed by the Asian Human Rights Commission (AHRC), that Khademul Islam Bidduth, and Jamal Ali, two Bangladesh activists, were forcibly deported by the South Korean authorities on December 30, 2003, and are facing prosecution in Bangladesh.  According to the information received, the police arrested Khademul Islam Bidduth, 29 years old, a leader of the Equality Trade Union - Migrants' Branch (ETU-MB), and Jamal Ali, 17 years old, an active participant in the migrant movement, during a demonstration that took place on October 26, 2003. After their deportation to Bangladesh, Mr. Bidduth and Mr. Ali remained in detention until January 4, 2004, when they were released on bail. At the request of South Korean authorities, they are now facing prosecution by the Bangladesh government for being associated with trade unions and civil society groups in South Korea.   ETU-MB, the only migrant workers' trade union in South Korea, is leading protests against the South Korean government's brutal crackdown against undocumented migrant workers. Reports indicate that ETU-MB members and supporters have been physically attacked by riot police and immigration authorities during recent demonstrations. According to the same sources, the South Korean government has already made it clear that it intends to break the ETU-MB and deport its leaders.   The crackdown against undocumented migrant workers was launched on October 24, 2003. Since that date, around 27,000 migrant workers have reportedly been deported or have left the country. Currently, an estimated 120,000 undocumented migrant workers, who have been in South Korea for more than four years, are facing forced deportation by the South Korean government. (For more information about the situation of migrant workers in South Korea, see the urgent appeal released by the OMCT, Case KOR 090104.ESCR).   Action requested :  Please write to the authorities of Bangladesh urging them to:  i. guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Khademul Islam Bidduth and Jamal Ali;  ii. put an end to any legal action against them, since these actions only aim at curtailing their freedom of expression and assembly;  iii. ensure the implementation of the provisions on the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders adopted by the UN general Assembly on December 9, 1998, in particular article 1 which states that “every person has the right, individually or collectively, to promote the protection and fulfilment of human rights and fundamental liberties at the national and international level”, as well as its article 9.2 which provides that “everyone whose rights or freedoms are allegedly violated has the right, either in person or through legally authorized representation, to complain to and have that complaint promptly reviewed in a public hearing before an independent, impartial and competent judicial or other authority established by law and to obtain from such an authority a decision, in accordance with law, providing redress, including any compensation due, where there has been a violation of that person's rights or freedoms, as well as enforcement of the eventual decision and award, all without undue delay.”  iv. guarantee the respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and other international instruments ratified by Bangladesh.
