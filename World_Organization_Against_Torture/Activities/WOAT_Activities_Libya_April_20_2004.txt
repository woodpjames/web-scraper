According to the information received from the Libyan League for Human Rights, Mr. Fathi El-Jahmi, a 63 civil engineer, was taken from his home by unidentified members of a security group on 4 April 2004. Mr. Fathi El-Jahmi has been missing since then.  Mr. El-Jahmi spent several years in jail for expressing his opinion about Libyan public affairs and for defending freedom of expression, assembly and association. In 2002, he was sentenced to five years in prison during a trial that he was not allowed to attend, for stating that reform in Libya would require a constitution, free speech and democracy. He was released on 12 March 2004, following a United States intervention on the eve of an official visit to Libya.  The Observatory fears that his dissapearance is linked with his statements about prisons'condition and the torture that he and other detainees were subjected to while in detention. According to the information received, since his release, Mr. El-Jahmi was subjected to harassment, provocations, and intimidations from the Libyan authorities (security surveillance, demonstration around his home...). Further, on March 19, members of the Revolutionary Committee Party ransacked the computer business of his son. They also threatened Mr. El-Jahmi with kidnapping his wife and daughters if he dared to express his views about Libya.  In addition, the Observatory is gravely concern over Mr. El-Jahmi's health. He suffers from diabetes and cardio-vascular diseases.  The Observatory urges the Libyan authorities to guarantee Mr. El-Jahmi's psychological and physical integrity and undertake prompt actions to locate Mr. El-Jahmi, inform the public of his whereabouts and ensure his immediate release.  The Observatory urges the Libyan authorities to conform with art 1 of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 9, 1998, which states that "Everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels" and art 6-b, which states that "Everyone has the right, individually and in association with others: As provided for in human rights and other applicable international instruments, freely to publish, impart or disseminate to others views, information and knowledge on all human rights and fundamental freedoms".    More generally, the Observatory urges the Libyan authorities to respect fundamental freedoms provided for by international human rights standards.  In hope that you will take these considerations and request into account,   We remain,       	Sidiki KABA			                Eric SOTTAS 	Président de la FIDH				Directeur de l'OMCT
