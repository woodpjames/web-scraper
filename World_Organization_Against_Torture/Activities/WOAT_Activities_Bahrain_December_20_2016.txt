Dear Mr. High Commissioner,
 
We, the undersigned
human rights organizations, write to urge your office to urgently and publicly call
on the Government of Bahrain to immediately and unconditionally release human
rights defender Nabeel Rajab and
drop the charges against him. His next, and likely final, trial date is scheduled for 28 December. 

Nabeel Rajab’s trial
is ongoing following the fifth extension of his court proceedings on 15
December. The further delay of Rajab’s trial to late December is additionally
concerning due to the precedent established by the Bahraini government to take
advantage of the time period around the end of year holidays to further violate
human rights. For example, on 28 December 2014, the Government of Bahrain arrested and charged Sheikh Ali Salman, the
Secretary General of the now dissolved Al-Wefaq political society, in relation
to his free expression. Salman continues to serve a nine-year arbitrary prison sentence following his own
lengthy trial. 
 
This December, Nabeel
Rajab could face up to 15 years in prison on charges regarding tweets and re-tweets
from his account addressing torture in Bahrain’s Jau Prison, as well as criticizing
Bahrain’s participation in Saudi Arabia-led military operations in Yemen. These
military actions in Yemen, according to the United Nations, have so far been
responsible for the deaths of more than 8,100 civilians, and include numerous
unlawful airstrikes on markets, homes, hospitals, and schools. Rajab’s comments
on Twitter about the Saudi-led coalition airstrikes in Yemen led to his arrest
on 2 April 2015. Bahrain’s penal code provides for up to 10 years in prison for
anyone who “deliberately announces in wartime false or malicious news,
statements or rumors.”
 
Bahraini authorities
released Rajab on 13 July 2015 in accordance with a royal pardon for previous Twitter-related
charges following extensive international pressure. However, the Public
Prosecution maintained this second round of charges against Rajab following his
release and ordered his re-arrest nearly a year later on 13 June 2016. Rajab is
also facing charges of “offending a foreign country” – Saudi Arabia – and “offending
national institutions” for his comments about the torture of inmates at Jau
Prison in March 2015. In October 2016, after months of trial hearings, the
court reopened his case for investigation rather than dismissing the charges
against him due to the lack of evidence. 
 
Moreover, the
government brought an additional charge against Rajab in relation to an
open letter published in the New York Times on 4 September 2016. The
Bahraini authorities immediately responded by charging Rajab with “undermining
the prestige of the state.” 
 
Since June 2016, Rajab
has been held in pre-trial detention, including two weeks of solitary
confinement following his initial arrest. The United Nations Standard Minimum
Rules for Non-Custodial Measures state that “pre-trial detention shall be used
as a means of last resort in criminal proceedings, with due regard for the
investigation of the alleged offence and for the protection of society and the
victim.” The government’s use of pretrial solitary confinement against Nabeel
Rajab while prosecuting him for free expression is clearly an additional form
of reprisal for his work as a human rights defender and is in breach of the
UN’s standards for detention. 
 
Nabeel Rajab is the
co-founder and president of the Bahrain Center for Human Rights, the founding
director of the Gulf Center for Human Rights, a Deputy Secretary General of the
International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) from 2012 to 2016, and holds
advisory positions with Human Rights Watch. Amnesty International considers him
to be a prisoner of conscience. His human rights activism and his peaceful
criticism of the Bahraini authorities have resulted in his imprisonment on two
previous occasions, between May 2012 and May 2014, and between January 2015 and
July 2015. 
 
Mr. High Commissioner,
your office has pursued and published a number of communications in relation to
human rights abuses perpetuated against Nabeel Rajab. Yet with his likely final
court appearance approaching, it is imperative, now more than ever, to use the
weight of your office to publicly defend him. We therefore call on you to issue
a public statement in defense of Nabeel Rajab as a human rights defender
arbitrarily detained for his free and peaceful expression. We further urge you
to publicly call on the Government of Bahrain to immediately and
unconditionally release Rajab, and to drop all charges against him.
