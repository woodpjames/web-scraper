Jonathan Ben Artzi is a pacifist and is expressing his freedom of  expression in refusing to serve in the army thereby denouncing  violations of human rights by the Israeli army in the Occupied  Territories, and the impunity for such acts. So far, he has served  seven consecutive prison sentences. In total, he has spent 196 days  behind bars. On February 19, 2003, he was brought before the Military  Court in Jaffa in order to be court martialled. The first hearing was  held on Tuesday 11th March 2003. He could face a sentence of up to  three years. The second hearing is due to take place on the 25th  March 2003. Parallel to these proceedings, the Supreme Court of  Jerusalem will render a decision next week on whether the Jaffa Court  Martial should or not defer the case to the competence of the civil  courts.  The several imprisonments imposed on Jonathan Ben Artzi are contrary  to article 18 of the International Covenant on civil and political  rights, which ensures freedom of thought, conscience and religion.  Even though article 18 does not explicitly refer to conscientious  objectors, the Human rights committee, in its General Observation n°  22, confirmed that they are protected by article 18, and it should  also be mentioned that, in its 2001 annual report, the Working group  on arbitrary detention stated that imprisonment of conscientious  objectors was contrary to article 18 § 2 of the Covenant. Finally,  the Working group, in its second recommendation (E/CN.4/2001/14,  chap.IV, sect. B), warns that justice should not be used as a means  to lead a conscientious objector to go against his beliefs.  Jonathan Ben Artzi's court martialling is the first since the 1970's.  This proves, if need be, that the Israeli authorities are trying to  prevent conscientious objectors from exercising their fundamental  right to refuse military service, especially bearing in mind that the  case of Jonathan Ben Artzi is not unique.  The Observatory has decided to follow the matter closely and will be  sending a judicial observer to the hearing of the 25th March 2003 in  Jaffa.
