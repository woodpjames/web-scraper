CONCERNS    The Criminal Justice Caucus notes with deep concern that the issue of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance within criminal justice and prison systems and law enforcement agencies are not addressed in the Draft Declaration and Programme of Action.    The Criminal Justice Caucus considers it essential that the World Conference Against Racism adequately addresses the issues of racism within criminal justice and prison systems.    Groups Most Vulnerable to Racism, Racial Discrimination,   Xenophobia & Related Intolerance    Persons who are vulnerable to racism or racial discrimination within the criminal justice system include persons who belong to any minority, racial, ethnic, national, linguistic, religious group or caste, indigenous peoples, migrants, and asylum-seekers and refugees who are placed in detention centres pending the outcome of a request for asylum.     Compounding factors which increase the likelihood of discrimination within these existing categories of vulnerable persons include gender, age (in particular children and young persons), sexual orientation, disability, economic status, and social origin, and persons living in situations or countries in conflict.       Manifestations of Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia   & Related Intolerance    Racism or racial discrimination occurs in multiple forms and at all stages within the criminal justice and prison systems, and in many instances leads to serious violations of fundamental human rights.   Within law enforcement agencies, it occurs during the period of investigation, prior to or at the moment of arrest in the form of unreasonable searches, stops or seizures, as part of the decision to charge a person with a criminal offence, and during any periods spent in police custody.     Legal provisions may be racially discriminatory, including automatic detention of asylum seekers and refugees, and the expulsion of foreign nationals after completion of sentence, regardless of their links with their country of origin, resulting in “double jeopardy” punishment.     Discrimination occurs as a result of the systemic lack of protection of vulnerable persons, including ignorance of local laws and culture, ignorance of the local language and lack of access to translators/ interpreters at critical stages of the criminal proceeding, fragile or illegal residential status, inability to access, or lack of financial resources for, an adequate defence.     Court decisions or administrative procedures often result in racially discriminatory outcomes such as overtly or covertly prejudicial judicial or jury decisions, disproportionately harsh sentencing (including the death penalty), and a lack of understanding of cultural differences, or of the very stresses related to being a member of a vulnerable group.     Vulnerable groups also suffer racial discrimination whilst serving sentences of the court: They may be assigned onerous prison sentences, even when non-custodial options exist; they may be physically, linguistically, and culturally isolated in active or passive ways during prison detention; they may be the victims of hatred, harassment, dehumanisation or violence by prison inmates and staff, and they may suffer difficulties in obtaining discretionary release, such as remission or parole.     Vulnerable groups may also suffer disproportionate hardship and stigmatisation after conviction, and/ or release, such as reintegration into the society, due to lack of access to cultural and economic support resources, accommodation and employment.             World Conference Against Racism, Racial   Discrimination,   Xenophobia & Related Intolerance - Durban,   South Africa         INTERNATIONAL   CRIMINAL JUSTICE CAUCUS: RECOMMENDATIONS    The Criminal Justice Caucus strongly recommends that a specific Chapter entitled CRIMINAL JUSTICE be added to the draft Programme of Action as follows :     The World Conference Against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia & Related Intolerance calls upon Governments :     1. To remove or amend in accordance with the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination all forms of legislation, policies or practices that have the purpose or effects of discrimination against any person on the basis of race, religion, nationality, language, caste, ethnicity, or minority or refugess status, through the full integration of international instruments relevant to racism into national laws, regulations and administrative practices, and the identification and elimination at the national level of institutionalised racism existing in the policies, procedures, practices and culture of public or private criminal justice institutions.     2. To give special consideration to the concerns and needs of women, youth, persons of African descent, indigenous peoples, sexual minorities, disabled persons, the poor, and persons living in situations or countries in conflict, who are affected by the criminal justice system, as well as to the incarceration and withholding of legal rights and services to asylum seekers and refugees.     3. To abolish the use of death penalty, giving particular consideration to the documented fact that throughout the world it is frequently used disproportionately against people belonging to racial ethnic and national minorities     4. To eradicate the impunity of law enforcement and correctional personnel, or other criminal justice officers, who engage in racist behaviour, including thorough investigation and disciplinary or criminal sanctions for abuses of power of a racist character, reviewing policing operations to ensure they are not racially discriminatory, by providing full, rapid, and effective independent investigations of complaints against public officials, by effectively monitoring and acting arbitrary detention of vulnerable persons.     5. To take effective measures to prevent the criminalisation and racial profiling of affected people at all levels of society. Such measures should include a clear prohibition of reliance on race, ethnic, or other group status in the exercise of enforcement, prosecutorial or judicial discretion and review of laws, policies and guidelines to ensure that they do not have a disparate impact.     6. To develop policies that prohibit the use of excessive force by law enforcement officers, focusing specially on non-lethal forms of arrest of suspects, should provide increased sanctions against actions motivated by race, religion, gender or other differences, and should instruct law enforcement officials on alternatives to the use of force and the proportionate levels of force and if it is required.     7. To recognise the right of travel which is infringed in many countries on the basis of race, colour and immigrants status, resulting in arbitrary arrest, detention, strip searches, temporary incarceration and other forms of harassment.     8. To recognise the right to a translator and/or interpreter, free of charge, at all stages of the criminal justice process, in particular during police interrogation and the court process.     9.

To ensure that asylum seekers are not subjected to criminal or other punishment on the basis of any illegal entry or presence. In particular, the detention of asylum seekers should be a measure of last resort only and subject to periodic judicial review, with an absolute maximum duration for detention specified in national law, and with strict and regular inspections by independent bodies.     17. To ensure that asylum sekers should be held in special immigration detention centers in conditions appropriate to their status and not with persons charged with or convicted of criminal offenses.     18.
