Brief description of the situation:  The Observatory has been informed by the Arab Program for Human Rights Activists (APHRA) about the decision to close down in Cairo the Association for Human Rights and Legal Aid (AHRLA), a non-governmental organisation monitoring and denouncing acts of torture in police stations as well as providing legal support to victims of torture.  According to the information received, on September 8, 2007, the Association for Human Rights Legal Aid was notified of a closing-down order issued by the Ministry of Social Solidarity, alleging financial transgressions. The Ministry based its order on Article 17(2) of Law n° 84 (2002), which states that “in all cases no NGO is permitted to receive money from abroad whether from Egyptian or foreign persons or agencies or their representatives in Egypt, or sending money to persons or organisations abroad unless they obtain the permission of the Minister of Social Solidarity, except for books, newsletters and scientific and artistic journals”.  In reality, even though the Association for Human Rights Legal Aid has always asked the Ministry for authorisation to receive grants from abroad, the Ministry has always refused to give its permission for long periods, therefore hindering human rights organisations from carrying out longstanding and sustainable activities, and thus violating international and regional human rights standards.  The Observatory expresses its deep concern about this new infringement to freedom of association in Egypt, and recalls that several branches of the Centre for Trade Union and Workers Services (CTUWS) were shut down in March and April 2007 (See Urgent Appeals EGY 001/0407/OBS 035 and 035.1, respectively issued on April 17 and 23, 2007). The Observatory therefore calls upon the Egyptian authorities to put their legislation in conformity with international and regional human rights standards concerning freedom of association, in particular with Article 13 of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 9, 1998, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to solicit, receive and utilize resources for the express purpose of promoting and protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms through peaceful means, in accordance with article 3 of the present Declaration”.   Action requested:  Please write to the Egyptian authorities and ask them to:   Put an end to all forms of harassment against the Association for Human Rights Legal Aid, repeal the decision to close it down and ensure in all circumstances that its members are able to carry out their work freely without any hindrances; Put an end to all forms of harassment against human rights defenders in Egypt; Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, in particular its Article 1, which provides that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, above-mentioned Article 11 as well as Article 12(1) that provides “everyone has the rights, individually and in association with others, to participate in peaceful activities against violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms”, and its Article 13 above-mentioned; Promote and ensure freedom of association in Egypt and ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by Egypt.
