The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a
partnership of FIDH and the World Organisation Against Torture
(OMCT), requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in Egypt.
 
New information:
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the conditional
release of Mr. Malek Adly, a human rights lawyer working for the Egyptian
Centre for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and co-funder of the Front of
Defence for Egyptian Protesters (FDEP).
 
According to the information received, on August 27, 2016, the Cairo
Criminal Court rejected the prosecution’s appeal and confirmed the decision to
release Mr. Malek Adly pending further investigations. The latter was finally
released on August 28, 2016 from Shubra Al-Khaimah police station. However, the
charges against Mr. Adly have not been dropped, and the latter can be called to
trial at any time.
 
The Observatory welcomes the release of Malek Adly, and requests the
judicial authorities to drop all the charges against him as they only aim at
sanctioning his legitimate human rights activities. 
 
Background information:
 
On May 5, 2016, Mr. Malek Adly was arrested by the Egyptian security forces
in Maadi, Cairo based on an arrest warrant issued on April 23, 2016. The arrest
warrant related to a call to protest on April 25, 2016, condemning the recent
government decision to transfer the sovereignty of two Red Sea islands to Saudi
Arabia (Tiran and Sanafir) and against President Al Sissi's policies, human
rights abuses and crimes committed by the Egyptian security forces. On April 11,
2016, Mr. Malek Adly had also filed a lawsuit against such government’s
decision on the islands.
 
Mr. Malek Adly was brought to Maadi police station and questioned.
During his interrogation, he was beaten, struck with firearms, blindfolded and
stripped of his shirt by police officers. He was then transferred to the
Shubra Al-Khaimah public prosecution, where he was questioned again for four
hours from 3 am to 7 am. 
 
On May 6, 2016, the prosecutor ordered his detention for 15 days,
pending investigation on several charges, including of “joining a group to
obstruct the law”, “spreading false news”, “plotting to overthrow the
government and alter the Egyptian Constitution”, “hindering the official duties
of government institutions”, “promoting publications that disrupt national
unity”, “inciting the anti-government protests that took place on April 25” and
“using violence and force against national security agency officers”. The
detention was extended several times until August 25, 2016, when the South
Benha Criminal Court ordered his release without bail, pending the outcome of
investigations. 
 
The prosecution appealed the court's decision and a review session was
set for August 27, 2016. Mr. Malek Adly remained in prison until the final
decision.
 
Mr. Malek Adly was detained in a 6x8 foot cell, without lighting or
ventilation. He was unable to leave except for court sessions or visits with
his wife and lawyers. Mr. Adly had also been denied the right to furnish his
cell with a bed and mattress, deprived of his right to exercise and recreation,
barred from visiting the prison library and mosque or receiving reading
material. Though Mr. Malek Adly was suffering from high blood pressure and
aching joints, he did not have access to medication or a doctor.
