Brief description of the situation The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by a reliable source and by Antenna International, a member of OMCT SOS-Torture network, about the lack of adequate medical care and difficult conditions of detention of Mr. Vasily Aleksanyan, currently detained in the hospital #60 in Moscow. Mr. Vasily Aleksanyan, former top executive at Yukos (former oil company), was reportedly arrested and detained in April 2006 on alleged fabricated charges of embezzlement and money laundering and remanded to prison at “Matrosskaya Tishina” prison in Moscow. He has reportedly developed severe medical conditions (a tumor of the liver, lymph nodes, convulsions and persistent fever) while in detention but, although his lawyers reportedly repeatedly requested for his transfer to a civil hospital, the judge rejected the appeal on the ground that it did not have sufficient reasons to believe he was sick. Mr. Vasily Aleksanayan was eventually transferred to hospital #60 on 8 February 2008, reportedly following a public campaign to support him, but without notice to his lawyers or his family. These latter found him after visiting several hospitals. However, according to the same information received, Mr. Vasily Aleksanyan is not being appropriately medically treated for his tumour and further suffers from difficult conditions of detention in the hospital. Mr. Vasily Aleksanyan would be under tight surveillance, not allowed to go outside or to have family visits. Several members of the Public Chamber, who visited him, reported that Mr. Vasily Aleksanyan was chained to the bed by a one meter chain composed of several handcuffs. Moreover, the light is reportedly never on in the ward and the guards, who are always present, change their shifts at night, impeding Mr. Vasily Aleksany to have a proper sleep. He has further limited access to the shower and was reportedly only able to shower thrice since he has been transferred. According to Mr. Nikolay Svanidze, a member of the Public Chamber, a special commission on Mr. Vasily Aleksanyan’s conditions in pre-trial detention has been launched. The authorities had reportedly further extended Mr. Vasily Aleksany’s pre-trial detention until March 2008 but the court procedures have been temporarily stopped because of his health conditions. The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned for the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Vasily Aleksanyan, in particular with the reported lack of appropriate medical treatment and difficult conditions of detention. OMCT is further concerned with regard to his arrest and detention at is seems to be politically motivated. Action requested Please write to the authorities in Russia urging them to:   Guarantee, in all circumstances, the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Vasily Aleksanyan and guarantee any medical treatment he may require due to his health condition;  Guarantee immediate and unconditional access to his lawyers and family;  Order his immediate release in the absence of valid legal charges that are consistent with international law and standards, or if such charges exist, bring him before an impartial and competent tribunal and guarantee his procedural rights at all times;  Ensure the respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
