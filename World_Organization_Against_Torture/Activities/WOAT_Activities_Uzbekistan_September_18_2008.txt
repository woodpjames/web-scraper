Brief description of the situation: The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the arbitrary detention and the judicial harassment faced by Mr. Akzam Turgunov, executive director and founder of “Mazlum” human rights center, a Tashkent-based human rights organisation, which defends the rights of political prisoners of conscience. In addition, Mr. Turgunov has served as a public defender in trials throughout Uzbekistan, including many in Karakalpakstan, in cases involving human rights violations. According to the information received, on September, 4, 2008, the Amudarya District Court, in Nukus, in Karakalpakstan, started the trial of Mr. Turgunov, which resumed on September, 16, 2008. Mr. Turgunov had been arrested on July 11, 2008 by the police in Manget, Karakalpakstan, on suspicion of extortion of money, under circumstances that seemed to have been staged to frame him and sanction him for his human rights activities. Mr. Turgunov is prosecuted pursuant to Article 165, Part 3, of the Uzbek Criminal Code and faces a prison sentence of up to 15 years. Furthermore, according to Mr. Turgunov’s public defender, on July 14, 2008, during his detention in the Nukus town police detention centre, he was taken to an investigator’s office and someone poured boiling water down his neck and back, causing severe burns. On July 22, 2008, Mr. Turgunov’s lawyer filed a request to the Prosecutor’s Office to investigate the ill-treatments. On September 16, 2008, the Amudarya District Court admitted the request and ordered a medical expertise. The tribunal will schedule the next hearing after transmission of the medical expertise report. The Observatory expresses its deep concern about to Mr. Turgunov’s arbitrary detention and judicial harassment, as it seems to merely sanction his human rights activities, and calls upon the Uzbek authorities to release him immediately and unconditionally. Action requested: Please write to the Uzbek authorities and ask them to:   Take all necessary measures to guarantee, in all circumstances, the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Turgunov;  Release immediately and unconditionally Mr. Turgunov since his detention is arbitrary as it merely aims at sanctioning his human rights activities;  Conduct a fair and impartial investigation into the above-mentioned allegations of torture and ill-treatment in order to identify all those responsible, bring them before a competent and impartial tribunal and apply to them the penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions provided by the law;  Put an end to any act of harassment - including at the judicial level - against Mr. Turgunov as well as against all human rights defenders in Uzbekistan;  Comply with the provisions of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 9, 1998, in particular Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually or collectively, to promote the protection and fulfilment of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, as well as Article 12.2, which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually or in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”;  Guarantee the respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and other international human rights instruments ratified by Uzbekistan.
