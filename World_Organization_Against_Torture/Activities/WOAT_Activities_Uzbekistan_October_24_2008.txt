New information: The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the sentencing of Mr. Akzam Turgunov, Executive Director and founder of “Mazlum” human rights centre, a Tashkent-based human rights organisation that defends the rights of political prisoners of conscience, to 10 years in prison. Mr. Turgunov has also served as a public defender in trials throughout Uzbekistan, including many in Karakalpakstan, in cases involving human rights violations. According to the information received, on October 23, 2008, a court in Manget, Karakalpakstan, an autonomous republic in Uzbekistan, 1,100 kilometres west of Tashkent, sentenced Mr. Turgunov to ten years’ imprisonment for “extortion”. Mr. Turgonov is presently detained in colony 64/СИ-9 in Nukus. The Observatory expresses its deep concern about to Mr. Turgunov’s sentencing, as it seems to merely sanction his human rights activities, and which is further evidence that the Uzbek authorities are determined to silence any dissenting voice in the country. This decision is all the more worrying that it came out a few days after the European Union decided, on October 13, 2008, to lift the sanctions against Uzbekistan, citing human rights “progress”. In addition, on October 10, 2008, another Uzbek human rights defender, Mr. Salijon Abdurahmanov, a journalist in Karakalpakstan, was already sentenced to ten years in prison[1]. The Observatory recalls that in accordance with Article 11 of the European Union (EU) Guidelines on Human Rights Defenders, the EU missions in Uzbekistan shall urge Uzbek authorities to comply with the relevant international norms and standards and, in particular, the 1998 UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders in order to create an environment where human rights defenders can operate freely. Accordingly, the Observatory calls upon the European Commission Delegation as well as EU missions in Uzbekistan to attend the trial in appeal of Mr. Turgunov and to report on all breaches of human rights standards. In addition, as a participating State of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the Observatory recalls that Uzbekistan acknowledges that “the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders [... places] a responsibility [...] on states to adopt and implement adequate legislation and administrative procedures that would provide for a conducive environment for human rights defenders to promote and strive for the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, and recognises “the need for particular attention, support and protection for human rights defenders by the OSCE, its Institutions and field operations, as well as by participating States”[2]. Background information: On July 11, 2008, Mr. Akzam Turgunov was arrested on July 11, 2008 by the police in Manget, Karakalpakstan, on suspicion of extortion of money, under circumstances that seemed to have been staged to frame him and sanction him for his human rights activities. Mr. Turgunov was prosecuted pursuant to Article 165, Part 3, of the Uzbek Criminal Code and was facing a prison sentence of up to 15 years. On September, 4, 2008, the Amudarya District Court, in Nukus, in Karakalpakstan, started the trial of Mr. Turgunov, which resumed on September, 16, 2008. Furthermore, according to Mr. Turgunov’s public defender, on July 14, 2008, during his detention in the Nukus town police detention centre, he was taken to an investigator’s office and someone poured boiling water down his neck and back, causing severe burns. On July 22, 2008, Mr. Turgunov’s lawyer filed a request to the Prosecutor’s Office to investigate the ill-treatments. On September 16, 2008, the Amudarya District Court admitted the request and ordered a medical expertise. Action requested: Please write to the Uzbek authorities and ask them to:   Take all necessary measures to guarantee, in all circumstances, the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Akzam Turgunov;  Release immediately and unconditionally Mr. Turgunov since his detention is arbitrary as it merely aims at sanctioning his human rights activities;  Conduct a fair and impartial investigation into the above-mentioned allegations of torture and ill-treatment in order to identify all those responsible, bring them before a competent and impartial tribunal and apply to them the penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions provided by the law;  Put an end to any act of harassment - including at the judicial level - against Mr. Turgunov as well as against all human rights defenders in Uzbekistan;  Comply with the provisions of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 9, 1998, in particular Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually or collectively, to promote the protection and fulfilment of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, as well as Article 12.2, which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually or in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”;  Comply with the provisions of the Document of the Copenhagen Meeting of the 2nd Conference on the Human Dimension of the Cooperation and Security Conference in Europe (CSCE) (1990), and guarantee the respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and other international human rights instruments ratified by Uzbekistan.
