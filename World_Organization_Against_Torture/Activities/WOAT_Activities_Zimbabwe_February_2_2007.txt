Brief description of the situation: The Observatory has been informed by Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights (ZLHR) about acts of harassment against Mr. Arnold Tsunga, Executive Director of ZLHR, Chairman of the Zimbabwe Human Rights Association (Zimrights) and 2006 Laureate of the Martin Ennals Award for Human Rights Defenders[1], as well as against Mr. Raymond Majongwe, Secretary General of the Progressive Teachers Union of Zimbabwe (PTUZ). According to the information received, on January 25, 2007, Mr. Arnold Tsunga was detained at the Harare International Airport, on his return from the World Social Forum in Kenya. Indeed, as he was leaving the arrivals terminal in the airport, Mr. Tsunga was approached by four men and brought to an office where he was briefly detained and interrogated. Mr. Tsunga was then released without charge. One of these men would be a well-known operative of the Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO), which is responsible for vetting people as they enter and exit the country. Since then, Mr. Tsunga would have been placed under surveillance by the CIO. Furthermore, on February 1, 2007, at around 5 a.m, several police officers from the Law and Order Section at Harare Central Police Station stormed into Mr. Raymond Majongwe’s house. His wife indicated that Mr. Majongwe had traveled out of Harare and could not possibly attend to them. The officers refused to heed to this information and continued to harass Mrs. Majongwe, threatening to arrest her and confiscate her identity documents. After protracted exchanges, the police officers left with a stern demand that Mr. Majongwe reports to the Harare Central Police Station at 8 a.m. without fail. No reasons were disclosed for their intention to question and obviously arrest him. Finally, Mr. Majongwe and his lawyers decided to report to the police station on February 5, 2007, fearing to be detained during the weekend. In the past, Mr. Raymond Majongwe has been arrested, detained, beaten, prosecuted (but not convicted) on numerous occasions for engaging in peaceful protests for workers’ rights and democracy in Zimbabwe. Throughout the country, in particular in rural areas, PTUZ members have been regularly harassed. For instance, on February 2, 2007, Messrs. Charles Kaguramhamba, Henry Chinorumba and P. Dube, three teachers and PTUZ members, were arrested at the Gaza Secondary School in Chipinge, for having organised a sit in calling for better work conditions of work and salaries. The three men are currently being detained at the Chipinge Police Station by officers from the Law and Order Section Chipinge. Action requested : Please write to the Zimbabwean authorities, urging them to :  Guarantee, in all circumstances, the physical and psychological integrity of Messrs. Raymond Majongwe and his wife, Arnold Tsunga, Charles Kaguramhamba, Henry Chinorumba and P. Dube, as well as of all human rights defenders in Zimbabwe; Release Messrs. Charles Kaguramhamba, Henry Chinorumba and P. Dube immediately and unconditionally since their detention is arbitrary; Put an end to all acts of harassment against all human rights defenders in Zimbabwe; Conform with the provisions of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, in particular its article 1 which states that “Everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, and article 12.2, providing that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually or in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”, as well as to comply with the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights, in particular articles 9, 10, 11 and 12, which guarantee the fundamental freedoms of expression, assembly and association; Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by Zimbabwe.
