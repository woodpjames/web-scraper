write in shock and deep sorrow regarding the murder of Honduran human 
rights and environmental defender Berta Cáceres, founder and general 
secretary of the Civic Council of Popular and Indigenous Organizations 
of Honduras (COPINH). We urge a response from the State Department that 
is not business as usual but a profound change of direction towards 
improving the abysmal situation of human rights in Honduras.Berta
Cáceres, winner of the prestigious 2015 Goldman Environmental Prize, 
was a visionary indigenous and environmental rights leader. She 
championed efforts to protect indigenous peoples from large-scale 
development projects that are being advanced in Honduras without 
consultation of communities and without concern for the environment. She
organized communities in Honduras and across the world against the 
unconsented extraction of natural resources and in defense of the 
Gualcarque River, a sacred site of the Lenca people and an essential 
water source, against the construction of the Agua Zarca hydroelectric 
dam. Berta Cáceres was a much-loved leader of the diverse social 
movements in her country. Members of Honduran civil society are united 
in sorrow and anger about her death—as are so many in the international 
community.Berta Cáceres was killed on March 3, 2016 by armed men
who broke into her home in La Esperanza, department of Intibucá, 
Honduras. Mexican environmentalist and journalist Gustavo Castro Soto of
Otros Mundos Chiapas/Friends of the Earth Mexico and the Mesoamerican 
Movement against the Extractive Mining Movement was also wounded in the 
attack. We urge that Mr. Castro immediately be permitted to return 
safely to his country.In the course of her work, Berta Cáceres 
suffered constant death threats against herself and her family, threats 
of sexual violence and assault, attacks and harassment. She was also the
subject of continual legal harassment by judicial authorities and 
intimidation by security forces and local government officials for her 
work. In the six months before her murder, according to COPINH, the 
threats against her escalated and included shots fired at her car and 
verbal threats and messages, by members of the military, police, local 
authorities and representatives of the hydroelectric company. Ms.
Cáceres had precautionary measures from the Inter-American Commission 
on Human Rights (IACHR) since 2009 but never received the full 
protection she needed. We are outraged by statements from Security 
Minister Julián Pacheco that in effect blame Cáceres for the failure of 
the Honduran government to comply with its obligation to protect her. 
She is one of 15 human rights defenders who have been killed in Honduras
while beneficiaries of IACHR precautionary measures, as reported by the
Committee of Relatives of the Disappeared in Honduras (COFADEH). On 
March 5, 2016, the IACHR granted precautionary measures for COPINH, 
Berta Cáceres’ family and Gustavo Castro Soto, given the risk to their 
safety.Berta Cáceres' death confirms what a 2015 report by 
Global Witness has shown: Honduras is one of the world's most dangerous 
countries for environmental activists. At least 109 environmental 
activists were murdered between 2010 and 2015. Since the 2009 coup, 
Honduras has become one of the world's most dangerous places to be a 
human rights defender of any kind. Indigenous and Garifuna leaders, 
LGBTI activists, union leaders, women’s rights activists, human rights 
activists, justice operators, and journalists reporting on human rights 
and corruption issues are among those who, like environmental activists,
are at risk. The murder of Berta Cáceres sends a devastating message to
all Hondurans trying to exercise their rights.We urge you:To
support an independent international investigation led by the 
Inter-American Commission on Human Rights into Ms. Cáceres’ murder and 
to urge that the Honduran government invite and fully cooperate with 
such an investigation. Such an independent investigation is essential 
given the lack of confidence in the judicial system; reigning impunity, 
including for cases involving human rights defenders; and the emblematic
nature of this case.To
insist that Honduran judicial authorities carry out their duties to 
effectively and promptly investigate Cáceres' murder, in cooperation 
with the international investigation, and following lines of inquiry 
that take into account the context of Cáceres' work and situation of 
risk and pursue the intellectual as well as material authors, 
guaranteeing due process and access to justice.To
press the Honduran government to comply with the precautionary measures
granted by the IACHR on March 5 and provide immediate, effective, and 
carefully consulted protection to members of COPINH, members of Ms. 
Cáceres’ family, Mr. Castro and all witnesses in the case.With
this tragic loss, we join together to call for more systemic change. We
ask that the State Department make clear to the Honduran government 
that future partnership and funding depends on demonstrating the 
political will to investigate and prosecute this crime and all crimes 
against human rights defenders. The Honduran government must make the 
mechanism for protection of human rights defenders, journalists, media 
workers and justice operators fully operational and adequately funded, 
with protection measures consulted with beneficiaries. It must guarantee
freedom of expression, including by ending harsh, constant repression 
of social protests, ensuring an immediate end to intimidating public 
statements by government officials and members of the military and 
police that place human rights defenders and journalists in danger, and 
ending specious prosecution of human rights defenders. It is 
crucial that the Honduran government meet, as the IACHR has said, its 
"obligation of carrying out the prior, free, and informed consultation 
of indigenous people regarding projects underway on their land and 
territories and that affect their natural resources." We support Senator
Patrick Leahy's call to abandon the Agua Zarca dam project and to 
protect the territory that Berta devoted her life to defending. The 
Honduran government should recognize that the pace and process by which 
it is facilitating the extraction and trade of natural resources by 
national and international investors is contributing to social conflict 
and human rights violations. We ask the U.S. government to:urge
the Honduran government to meet its obligation to ensure prior, free, 
and informed consent of indigenous communities and to greatly improve 
transparency regarding existing and proposed concessions of natural 
resources. This should include making public project information 
regarding the nearly 50 hydropower concessions granted since the start 
of 2010.ensure
that no U.S. assistance and support for multilateral bank projects 
promote or permit development projects without meeting the obligation 
for ensuring prior, free and informed consent of indigenous communities,
nor without ensuring meaningful consultation of all affected 
communities and that strong human rights, labor rights and environmental
safeguards are in place.Finally,
we urge the State Department to suspend all assistance and training to 
Honduran security forces, with the exception of investigatory and 
forensic assistance to the police, so long as the murders of Berta 
Cáceres and scores of other Honduran activists remain in impunity. In 
addition, we urge the State Department to implement transparently and 
fully the conditions in the FY2016 State, Foreign Operations bill which 
link 50 percent of aid to the central government of Honduras to progress
on addressing human rights abuses and corruption. The U.S. 
government must stand with those who are putting their lives on the line
for the protection of human rights and the environment in Honduras. Signed by:Accountability CounselActionAid USA Alabama Center for Rural EnterpriseAlabama Coalition for Immigrant Justice (ACIJ)Alianza AmericasAlliance Against Mining -
