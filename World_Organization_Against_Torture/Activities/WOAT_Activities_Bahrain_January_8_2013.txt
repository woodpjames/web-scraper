The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of
the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation
Against Torture (OMCT), has received new information and requests your urgent
intervention in the following situation in Bahrain.
 
New
information:
 
The
Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the judicial harassment
of Mr. Sayed Yousif AlMuhafdhah,
Acting Vice President and Head of Documentation Unit of the Bahrain Center for
Human Rights (BCHR). 

According to the information received, on January 9, 2013, Mr. Sayed Yousif
AlMuhafdhah will appear before the Fourth Lower Criminal Court to face charges of
spreading false information on Twitter. He faces a prison sentence of up to one
year and a fine of up to 100 BD.
 
The
Observatory strongly condemns the continued arbitrary detention and judicial
harassment of Mr. AlMuhafdhah, and calls on the Bahraini authorities to release
him immediately and unconditionally, as it seems to merely aim at sanctioning
and hindering his human rights activities. 

The Observatory more generally reiterates its call on the Bahraini authorities
to put an end to all acts of harassment – including at the judicial level –
against all human rights defenders in Bahrain, and to comply with all
international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by
Bahrain, in particular the United Nations (UN) Declaration on Human Rights
Defenders, adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 9, 1998. 
 
Background information: 

On September 23, 2012, Mr. AlMuhafdhah and other Bahraini human rights defenders
who cooperated with the United Nations (UN) received threats of reprisals while
they were in Geneva to participate in the 21st session of the UN Human Rights
Council. The pro-governmental newspaper Al-Watan accused Mr. AlMuhafdhah and
other human rights defenders of “defaming Bahrain” and labelled them as
“traitors to the country”. 

On November 2, 2012, Mr. AlMuhafdhah was arrested in Duraz while he was
documenting the injury of a man who was shot by bird-shot pellets at a protest
earlier that day. Mr. AlMuhafdhah was transferred to Budaiya Police Station
where he was interrogated about his presence at the injured man’s door. 

In the morning of November 3, 2012, Mr. AlMuhafdhah was taken to the public
prosecution where he was remanded seven days of detention on charges of
“participation in illegal protests”. On November 10, 2012, the public
prosecution decided to extend Mr. Sayed Yousif AlMuhafdhah’s detention by seven
additional days without providing any grounds or justification for this
decision. On November 14, 2012, the Public Prosecution decided to release Mr.
Sayed Yousif AlMuhafdhah and drop the charges of “participation in illegal
protests” that had been pending against him since November 2, 2012. 
 
On
December 17, 2012, Mr. Sayed Yousif AlMuhafdhah was arrested while he was
monitoring a demonstration held in the capital city of Manama to mark the
anniversary of two protesters who were killed in 1994. On December 18, the
Public Prosecutor remanded him in custody in Hooth Al-Jaff prison for seven
days pending an investigation on charges of spreading false information on
Twitter. 
 
On
December 25, 2012, Mr. Sayed Yousif AlMuhafdhah was presented before the Public
Prosecution, which renewed his detention by 15 days. 
 

On
December 27, 2012, the Public Prosecution referred the case to the Court. 
Actions
requested: 

The Observatory urges the authorities of Bahrain to: 
 
i.
Guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Sayed Yousif
AlMuhafdhah, as well as of all human rights defenders in Bahrain; 

ii. Release Mr. Sayed Yousif AlMuhafdhah immediately and unconditionally as his
detention is arbitrary since it seems to merely sanction his human rights
activities; 

iii. Put an end to any act of harassment, including at the judicial level,
against Mr. AlMuhafdhah, as well as against all human rights defenders in
Bahrain; 

iv. Conform in any circumstances with the provisions of the UN Declaration on
Human Rights Defenders, in particular:
      its Article 1, which states that “everyone
has the right, individually or in association with others, to promote the
protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the
national and international levels” ;
      its Article 6 (c) which states that
“everyone has the right, individually and in association with others to study,
discuss, form and hold opinions on the observance, both in law and in practice,
of all human rights and fundamental freedoms and, through these and other
appropriate means, to draw public attention to those matters” ;
      and its Article 12.2 which states that
“the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the
competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others,
against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse
discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his
or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present
Declaration”. 

v. Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental
freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and
international instruments ratified by Bahrain.
