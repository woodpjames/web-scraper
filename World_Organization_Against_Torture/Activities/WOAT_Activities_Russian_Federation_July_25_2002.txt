The military group arrived at Memorial in a big car, managed to force the door as there was nobody in the premises, and began to destroy equipment located within. One of the Memorial’s employees arrived at which point the members of the military group halted their searching and destructive activities, which are estimated as having caused around 5000 roubles worth of damage. Memorial lodged a complaint to denounce this attack but  the military forces answered that they were carrying out routine searches.  Since the beginning of the Chechen war, Memorial has undertaken daily monitoring activities in the region.  Memorial collaborated with the federal administration in Chechnya and tried to organize round tables between the military forces, the administration and itself, in order to discuss about certain problematic issues. A few days before the attack, Memorial, considering that the dialogue had failed because of the lack of co-operation on the part of the other participants, ended collaboration with the federal forces through an open declaration.   The Observatory recalls that, there are such administrative obstacles and pressure on the part of the military forces,  that those who try to undertake activities related to human rights in Chechnya and in the border Republic of Ingushetia face major risks.   Actions requested:   Please write to the Russian authorities urging them to:  i. Guarantee the security and physical integrity of the human rights defenders working in Chechnya and in Ingushetia;  ii. Order an immediate investigation into this attack in order to identify those responsible, bring them to trial and apply the sanctions provided by law;  iii. Put an end to all forms of harassment and violence against Human Rights Defenders and ensure the implementation of the provisions of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders adopted by  the UN general Assembly on December 9, 1998 in particular its article 1, which provides that "every person has the right, individually or collectively, to promote the protection and fulfilment of human  rights and fundamental liberties at the national and international level" and article 12: "The State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone,  individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her  legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present declaration.";  iv. Guarantee the respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and other international instruments ratified by Russia.   Addresses:  1.
