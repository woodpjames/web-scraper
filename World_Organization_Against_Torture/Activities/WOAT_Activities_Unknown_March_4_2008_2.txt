Description of the situation: The Observatory has been informed by the Iranian League for the Defence of Human Rights (LDDHI) of a new wave of harassment of Iranian women involved in the One Million Signatures campaign, which seeks to put pressure on the Iranian legislators in order to withdraw provisions that have adverse effects on women’s human rights. According to the information received, on February 19, 2008, Ms. Ehteram Shadfar, an active member of the campaign, was sentenced in absentia to six months’ suspended imprisonment for “endangering national security” and “propaganda against the State” by the branch 13 of the Revolutionary Courts. The sentence will be suspended for two years, and will not be implemented unless she is found guilty of another crime during this time frame. Ms. Shadfar had been arrested on June 10, 2007 by the security police from Police Station 104, in Nilofar Square, and had spent 24 hours in Vozara detention centre. The Observatory was further informed that on February 25, 2008, Ms. Parvin Ardalan, another member of the campaign, was summoned to Tehran Revolutionary Courts and that she was forced, on March 3, 2008, to get out of a plane to Stockholm (Sweden), where she had been invited to receive the Olaf Palme[1], in honour of her achievements and activism designed to achieve equal rights for women. Her passport was retained on that occasion, and Ms. Ardalan was given a court order that required her to show up at the security branch of the passport office within 72 hours. The Observatory recalls that Ms. Ardalan had been sentenced on April 24, 2007 to three years’ imprisonment, of which two and a half were suspended, and had immediately appealed the sentencing[2]. The Observatory expresses its deep concern about the ongoing harsh repression of the Iranian authorities against human rights defenders, in particular women’s rights activists involved in the One Million Signatures Campaign, and recalls that more than a hundred of women’s rights activists have been arrested, interrogated, or sentenced in the past two years. The Observatory further wishes to insist on the fact that Iran had committed to “uphold the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights”[3] by presenting its candidacy to the Human Rights Council 2006 election and had insisted in this regard on the fact that the country had “continuously put great efforts into safeguarding the status and inherent dignity of the human person as well as the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms”[4]. In order to ensure the continuation of these efforts, the Observatory urges the Islamic Republic of Iran to conform with international human rights standards. Actions requested: Please write to the authorities in Iran urging them to:   Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Ms. Ehteram Shadfar and Ms. Parvin Ardalan, as well as all activists engaged in the “One Million Signatures” campaign;  Drop all arbitrary charges and all judicial proceedings against them as well as against all women’s rights defenders involved in the “One million signatures” campaign;  Put an end to all acts of harassment, including at the judicial level, against Iranian human rights defenders;  Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, Article 6.b, which provides that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others [...] freely to publish, impart or disseminate to others views, information and knowledge on all human rights and fundamental freedoms”, and Article 12.2, which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”;  More generally, ensure in all circumstances the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with international and regional human rights instruments ratified by Iran.
