The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights
Defenders, a joint programme of the International Federation for Human Rights
(FIDH) and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent
intervention in the following situation in Belarus.
 
Description of the situation :
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources
about the sentencing of Mr. Valiantsin Stefanovich, Vice-Chairman of the Human Rights Centre “Viasna”.
 
According to the information received, on October 19,
2011, Mr. Stefanovich was requested to pay 4,727,330 Belarusian rubles
(about 600 euros) in the administrative case opposing him to the tax inspection
of Minsk Partyzanski District. He was accused of having "understated the
amount of his taxable income".
 
The Observatory recalls that the authorities have been
hunting Mr. Valiantsin Stefanovich's resources over the past years. Since 2008,
he has been asked on several occasions to provide his tax returns, including a
tax form on the total income he received over 10 years (1998-2008), although he
had already presented all those documents to the district tax inspection.
 
The Observatory strongly denounces the sentencing of
Mr. Stefanovich, which seems to merely aim at sanctioning his human rights
activities.
 
Moreover, the Observatory recalls that Mr. Ales
Bialiatski, President of Viasna and FIDH Vice-President, has been arrested
and arbitrary detained since August 4, 2011, in a detention centre of the
Interior Ministry located in Valadarski street. The latter was charged under
Article 243, part 2, of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Belarus
(“concealment of profits on an especially large scale”), which provides for up
to seven years' imprisonment, with confiscation of property. The criminal case
is to be considered by the Pershamaiski District Court of Minsk (Judge Syarhei
Bandarenka), but the trial will be held in the premises of the Maskouski District
Court. The first hearing of the trial is scheduled on November 2, 2011 at 10:00
am.
 
This case was opened on the basis of information
related to Mr. Bialatski's bank account at a bank in Vilnius, Lithuania, which
was provided by the Lithuanian Ministry of Justice to the Belarusian
authorities. The Belarusian tax authorities interpreted the amount on the
account of Mr. Bialatski's as his personal income and accused him of concealing
it. In reality, this money, which was transferred by international organisations,
was by no means used as personal funds but to finance the activities of the HRC
"Viasna", such as assistance provided to victims of the political
repression in the post-electoral context.
 
Actions requested :
 
Please write to the Belarusian authorities, urging
them to :
 
I. Guarantee in
all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Valiantsin Stefanovich, Mr. Ales Bialatski as well as of all human rights defenders in Belarus;
 
ii.
Put an end to any kind of harassment - including at the judicial level -
against Mr. Valiantsin Stefanovich, Mr. Ales Bialatski as well as against all
other human rights defenders;
 
iii. Release Mr. Ales Bialatski immediately
and unconditionally since his detention is arbitrary as it seems to merely sanction
his human rights activities;
 
iv.
Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders,
adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998,
especially:
- its Article 1, which
states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with
others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realization of human
rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”,
- its Article 6 (b) and
(c), which states that “Everyone has the right, individually and in association
with others […] as provided for in human rights and other applicable
international instruments, freely to publish, impart or disseminate to others
views, information and knowledge on all human rights and fundamental freedoms
and [...] to study, discuss, form and hold opinions on the observance, both in
law and in practice, of all human rights and fundamental freedoms and, through
these and other appropriate means, to draw public attention to those matters”.
- and its Article 12.2,
which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the
protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in
association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto
or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a
consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the
present Declaration” ;
 
Ensure
in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance
with international human rights standards and international instruments
ratified by the Belarusian Republic.
