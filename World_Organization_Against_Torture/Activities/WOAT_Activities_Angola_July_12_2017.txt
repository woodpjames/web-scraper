Judicial
harassment
Angola
July 12, 2017
 
The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a partnership of FIDH
and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent intervention
in the following situation in Angola.
 
Description of the situation:
 
The
Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the judicial harassment
of Mr. Rafael Marques de Morais, an award-winning[1]
investigative journalist known for his articles denouncing corruption. 
 
According to
the information received, on June 20, 2017, the Office of the Attorney
General  indicted Mr. Rafael Marques de
Morais under two charges: “outrage towards a sovereign body” (ultraje ao
órgão de soberania) (Article 25, par. 1 of the Law on Crimes against the
State Security and Art. 105, par. 1 of the Angola Constitution), and “insult
towards public authority” (injúrias contra autoridade pública) (Article
181 of the Penal Code), which carry a total penalty of up to six years of
prison. 
 
Additionally
to those accusations, on May 25, 2017, the Attorney General, Mr. João Maria de
Sousa as a private citizen, filed a lawsuit against Mr. Rafael Marques de
Morais under the offences of “abuse of press freedom” (Article 74, par. 2, d of
the former Media Law No. 7/06), “slander” (Article 7 of the Penal Code), and
“defamation” (Article 410 of the Penal Code).
 
The
accusations are related to an article published on the anti-corruption website,
Maka Angola. In the article, Mr. Rafael Marques de Morais exposed the
illegality of Angola’s Attorney General, Mr. João Maria Moreira de Sousa, to
act as a property and real estate developer in addition to his legal duties,
action which violates the “Principle of Exclusive Dedication” enshrined in the
Constitution. The article also brought to the spotlight the support of the
President, Mr. José Eduardo dos Santos, towards his subordinates corrupted acts
in violation of constitutional rules.
 
The
Observatory recalls that this is not the first incident targeting Mr. Rafael
Marques de Morais. After the
publication in 2011 of his book, “Blood Diamonds: Corruption and Torture in
Angola”[2],
he has faced continuous judicial harassment[3].
Following its publication, eight Angolan generals and two private mining
companies sued Mr. Marques de Morais for defamation – twice in Portugal where
the book was originally published and once in Angola. Mr. Marques de Morais was
found guilty by the Luanda Provincial Tribunal on 28 May 2015 for committing
“slanderous denunciation” against 12 individuals, including members of the
armed forces. He was sentenced to six months suspended jail term.
The
Observatory strongly condemns the judicial harassment of Mr. Rafael Marques de
Morais. The Observatory believes the accusations are linked to his human rights
work, and consequently urges Angolan judicial authorities to end all forms of
harassment against him.
 
Actions requested: 
 
Please write
to the authorities in Angola, urging them to:
 
i. Drop all
the charges against Mr. Rafael Marques de Morais and, in the meantime, ensure
that any judicial proceedings against him is carried out in full compliance
with the defendants’ right to a fair trial, as protected under international
law;
 
iii.
Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr.
Rafael Marques de Morais as well as of all human rights defenders in Angola;
 
iv. Put an
end to all forms of harassment, including at judicial level, against Mr. Rafael
Marques de Morais, as well as all human rights defenders in Angola; 
 
v. Comply
with all the provisions of the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights
Defenders adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 9, 1998, in particular
its Articles 1, 12.1 and 12.2;
 
vi. Ensure
in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in
accordance with international human rights standards and international
instruments ratified by Angola.
