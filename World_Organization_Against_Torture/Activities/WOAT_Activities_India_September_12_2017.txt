The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a partnership of FIDH
and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent
intervention in the following situation in India.
 
Brief description of the
information:
 
The
Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the murder of Ms. Gauri
Lankesh, journalist
and Editor of Lankesh Patrike
newspaper[1]. Ms.
Lankesh was an outspoken defender of freedom of expression and was critical of
communal violence and violent rhetoric promoted by Hindu nationalists.
 
According
to the information received, on the evening of September 5, 2017, Ms. Lankesh
was fatally shot in front of her residence in Bangalore, Karnataka State, by
three unidentified gunmen as she was returning from work. There were several
bullet wounds to her head and chest. 
 
A Special
Investigation Team headed by Inspector General of Police (Intelligence) B. K.
Singh was subsequently formed to investigate the killing. 
 
Ms.
Lankesh had repeatedly been the target of online death threats, including from
Hindu nationalists, and other acts of harassment because of her human rights
work. 
 
Ms.
Lankesh was also known for her criticisms of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party
(BJP). In November 2016, Ms. Lankesh was found guilty of defamation and
sentenced to six months in jail along with a fine of RS 10,000 (approximately
130 euros) in two cases brought against her by Lower House BJP MP Pralhad Joshi
and BJP member Umesh Dushi. The case related to an article published in Lankesh Patrike in 2008 entitled
“Darodege Illida BJP galu [BJP men involved in criminal activities]”, which
accused three persons, including Umesh Dushi, of cheating a businessman in the
city of Hubli in Karnataka and also alleged the involvement of Pralhad Joshi in
the case. 
 
The Observatory condemns in the strongest
terms the murder of Ms. Lankesh and urges the Indian authorities to adopt
effective measures to ensure the protection of human rights defenders in the
country.
 
The Observatory also calls for an immediate,
thorough, impartial, and transparent investigation into Ms. Lankesh’s murder
and for those responsible to be held to account.
