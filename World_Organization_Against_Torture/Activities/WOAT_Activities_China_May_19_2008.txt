New information: The Observatory has been informed by Human Rights in China (HRIC) of the decision of the Beijing Municipal Chaoyang District People’s Court to uphold an administrative ban issued by the Beijing General Station of Exit and Entry Frontier Inspection in August 2007 against Ms. Yuan Weijing, the wife of Mr. Chen Guangcheng, a lawyer involved in denouncing the extensive use of violence by the authorities of Linyi in relation to birth planning policies. According to information received, on May 14, 2008, the court delivered this ruling following a lawsuit filed by Ms. Yaun to challenge the August 2007 decision. The court held the hearing behind closed doors, on grounds that the case involved State secrets, including Ms. Yuan’s status as a criminal suspect, and the invalidation of her passport[1]. Ms. Yuan was unable to attend as she was forcibly kept at her home by the local authorities. This ban will prevent her from leaving the country to receive the Ramon Magsaysay Award on her husband’s behalf in the Philippines. Indeed, the Observatory recalls that Mr. Chen Guangcheng remains detained since March 11, 2006, and that he was sentenced to four years’ and three months’ imprisonment for “organising a mob to disrupt traffic” on August 24, 2006 (See background information). The Observatory expresses its deepest concern regarding the Chinese court’s decision to uphold the travel ban on Ms. Yuan Weijing from leaving the country, which blatantly violates freedom of movement and merely aims at sanctioning Mr. Chen’s family members. The Observatory also expresses its deepest concern about Mr. Chen’s ongoing arbitrary detention. The Observatory further recalls that the National People’s Congress amended the Chinese Constitution in 2004 to include that “the State respects and safeguards human rights” and that in April 2006, China submitted a document to the UN in order to support its candidacy to the Human Rights Council’s first election, in which it affirmed that the amendment to the Constitution was aiming at “defining the position of human rights in the overall national development strategy”. The Observatory further wishes to point out that, as a member of the Human Rights Council, China “shall uphold the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights”. Background information: On March 11, 2006, Mr. Chen Guangcheng was arrested with other militants by local police officers for “disturbing traffic”. It is only on June 11, 2006 that his wife was informed by the Yinan PSB that her husband was charged with “deliberate destruction of property” and “organising a mob to disrupt traffic”. Before he was arrested, Mr. Chen had been campaigning against the Linyi city authorities’ recurrent use of violence for the implementation of the Government birth quotas. Starting in April 2005, Chen and his wife, Yuan Weijing, began to investigate villagers’ claims that Linyi City authorities were employing extensive violence, and to put together briefs for lawsuits against officials involved. Their work represented one of the first-known domestic effort to challenge the use of violence in the enforcement of China’s population policy. On June 19, 2006, the authorities banned a press conference in Beijing that called on the international community to denounce Mr. Chen’s situation. The organisers of the conference were interrogated and put under surveillance. Mr. Chen’s family was also subjected to repeated acts of harassment. On August 24, 2006, Mr. Guangcheng was sentenced to four years’ and three months’ imprisonment, without his lawyers being allowed inside the hearing room. His trial only lasted two hours. On October 31, 2006, the Court of Appeal ordered the review of Mr. Chen’s case. On November 27, 2006, the new proceedings against Mr. Chen took place before the People’s Court of Yinan Canton and lasted ten hours. His lawyers, his wife and his mother were allowed to attend the hearing. On December 1, 2006, the Court sentenced Mr. Chen to four years and three months in prison for “intentionally disrupting traffic” and “inciting material destruction”. On December 8, 2006, Mr. Chen’s lawyer appealed the decision to the Intermediary Court of Linyi City. Actions requested: Please write to the authorities in the People’s Republic of China, urging them to:   Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Chen Guangcheng, of Ms. Yuan Weijing and of all his relatives;  Release Mr. Chen Guangcheng immediately and unconditionally since his detention is arbitrary;  Cancel the above-mentioned administrative ban against Ms. Yuan Weijing as it is contrary to internationally recognised human rights standards;  Put an end to any acts of harassment against Ms. Yuan Weijing, Mr. Chen Guangcheng and, more generally, against all human rights defenders in the People’s Republic of China;  Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, its article 9, which states that “[...] everyone has the right, individually or in association with others, to benefit from an effective remedy and to be protected in the event of the violation of those rights” and its Article 12.2, which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”;  Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by the People’s Republic of China.
