Description of the situation: The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the ongoing arbitrary detention of and a new sentence of two years, six months and six days in a penal colony against Mr. Ganikhon Mamatkhanov, regional representative of the International Society for Protection of Human Rights in the Ferghana region of Uzbekistan. According to the information received, on March 29, 2014, Mr. Ganikhon Mamatkhanov was sentenced to two years, six months and six days in a penal colony for having disobeyed orders of the prison administration, within the framework of a hearing that took place in the penal colony no. 64/47 in Navoi. According to the charges, he allegedly violated Article 221 of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Uzbekistan (“disobedience to legitimate orders of administration of institution of execution of penalty”). On May 15, 2014, the Court of Appeal will review the decision. The Observatory deplores the fact that Mr. Mamatkhanov already spent four and a half years in arbitrary detention, on the basis of unfair proceedings marred by a number of irregularities. In October 2009, he was sentenced to five years on charges of fraud and bribery (Articles 168 and 211 of the Criminal Code). Independent observers who monitored the trial concluded that the court failed to establish proof of Mr. Mamatkhonov's engagement in alleged bribery. On March 10, 2014 he was due to be released from the Navoi penal colony. However, shortly before this date he was sent to a punishment cell because he had allegedly gone to the toilet three times without asking. On March 28, 2014, his family was informed that he was facing criminal charges for having violated the above-mentioned Article 221 of the Criminal Code. Since April 30, 2014, Mr. Mamatkhanov has been held in the pre-trial custody section of Prison 64/25 of Karaulbazar settlement in the Bukhara region. The Observatory further deplores the gross violations of the fair trial principles. Mr. Mamatkhanov's family was indeed not informed about the new trial and pre-detention and could not access him. Mr. Mamatkhanov was also denied access to a lawyer of his own choice. His family has managed to hire a legal counsel of their choice only for the hearing at the Court of Appeal, to take place on May 15, 2014. The Observatory is deeply concerned by Mr. Ganikhon Mamatkhanov's ongoing arbitrary detention and judicial harassment, which seems to only aim at sanctioning his human rights activities, and calls for his immediate and unconditional release. The Observatory also urges the Court of Appeal to thoroughly consider the case in accordance with fair trial principles. The Observatory also deplores the ongoing arbitrary detention of several other human rights defenders in Uzbekistan, in particular that of Messrs. Azam Formonov, Nasim Isakov, Yuldosh Rasulov, Zafar Rakhimov, Gaybullo Jalilov, Solijon Abdurakhmanov, Dilmurod Saidov, Azam Turgunov and Abdurasul Hudoynazarov, and reiterates its calls for their immediate and unconditional release.

Ganikhon Mamatkhanov, Khabibulla Okpulatov, Azam Formonov, Nasim Isakov, Yuldosh Rasulov, Zafar Rakhimov, Gaybullo Jalilov, Solijon Abdurakhmanov, Dilmurod Saidov, Azam Turgunov and Abdurasul Hudoynazarov as well as of all human rights defenders in Uzbekistan; ii.
