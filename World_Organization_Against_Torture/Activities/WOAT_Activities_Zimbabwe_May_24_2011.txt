The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights
Defenders, a joint programme of the International Federation for Human Rights
(FIDH) and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent
intervention in the following situation in Zimbabwe.
 
Description of the situation :
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources
about the arbitrary arrest by the police of Ms. Florence
Ndlovu and Mr. Walter Dube,
respectively Regional Coordinator for Matabeleland province and Paralegal Officer for Matabeleland, Midlands and Masvingo
provinces for Zimbabwe Human Rights Association (ZimRights),
as well as about the disruption by the police of a meeting convened by
ZimRights on torture in Tsholotsho,
Matabeleland North province. 
 
According
to the information received, on May 23, 2011, Ms. Florence Ndlovu and Mr.
Walter Dube were arrested by the police as they were coming from Tshino
Business Centre in Tsholotsho, where the police had earlier on disrupted a workshop that was being convened by ZimRights to raise villagers’ awareness about torture and its effects, on the pretext that the meeting was unlawful. 
As
of issuing this Urgent Appeal, Ms. Florence Ndlovu and Mr. Walter Dube remained
detained at Nyamandlovu police station in Matebeleland North province, at about
40km out of Bulawayo. In addition, two lawyers from Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights (ZLHR) who had gone to deal with the case were denied access to them after mounting a rapid response to their
arrest. The police denied detaining Ms.
Ndlovu and Mr. Dube and
claimed that the two ZimRights employees had been taken to Sipepa Business
Centre despite evidence of their detention through the presence of their
vehicle that was parked at the police station.
By the night of the same
day, the lawyers were working on filing a habeas corpus petition to
challenge the detention of the two ZimRights staff members.
 
The police action in
disrupting the ZimRights workshop is in defiance of a court order which was
issued on May 20 by Bulawayo Magistrate Ntombizodwa
Mazhandu. Indeed, in accordance with
legal provisions, on May 17, 2011, ZIMRIGHTS regional officers gave notice to
the police of their intention to hold the meeting. ZimRights was then forced to engage the services of
ZLHR after the Police Officer Commanding Tsholotsho District in Matabeleland
North banned them from holding the workshop after claiming that “the subject of
torture is not in line with Zimbabwean culture”. ZLHR
filed an application before the Bulawayo Magistrate Court arguing that under
Section 24 of the Public Order and Security Act (POSA) they were exempt from
notifying the police as this was not a political gathering. On May 20, 2011, Magistrate Mazhandu interdicted the police
from disturbing or interfering in any way with the ZimRights workshop and
ordered the organisation to proceed with the workshop as scheduled and promote
its right to freedom of association and assembly as set out in Section 21 of
the Constitution and the right to freedom of expression as guaranteed under
Section 20 of the Constitution.
 
The Observatory deeply condemns the arbitrary arrest
of Ms. Florence Ndlovu and Mr. Walter Dube, which seems to merely aim at
sanctioning their human rights activities, and urges the Zimbabwean authorities
to guarantee their physical and psychological integrity as well as to release
them immediately and unconditionally since their detention is arbitrary. 
 
Actions requested:
 
Please write to the authorities of Zimbabwe asking
them to:
 
i.        
Guarantee in all circumstances the
physical and psychological integrity of Ms. Florence Ndlovu and Mr. Walter Dube
as well as all ZimRights members and all human rights defenders in the country;
 
ii.      
Release Ms. Florence Ndlovu and Mr.
Walter Dube immediately and unconditionally since their detention is arbitrary
as it only aims at sanctioning their human rights activities; 
 
iii.     
In the meantime, guarantee unconditional access to their
lawyers and families;
 
iv.     Order an immediate, thorough, effective and impartial investigation into
the above-mentioned facts, the result of which must be made public, in order to
identify all those responsible, bring them before a civil competent and impartial
tribunal and apply to them the penal and/or administrative sanctions provided by the law; 
 
v.      
Put an end to any kind of harassment
- including at the judicial level - against Ms. Florence Ndlovu and Mr. Walter
Dube as well as against all human rights defenders in Zimbabwe; 
 
vi.     Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights
Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9,
1998, especially its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right,
individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the
protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the
national and international levels”, and Article 12.2, which provides that the
State shall “take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the
competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others,
against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse
discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his
or her legitimate exercise of his or her rights”; 
 
vii.    More generally, ensure in all circumstances the respect for human rights
and fundamental freedoms in accordance with in accordance with the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights and with international and regional human rights
instruments ratified by Zimbabwe.
