The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights
Defenders, a joint programme of the International Federation for Human Rights
(FIDH) and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent
intervention in the following situation in Bahrain.
 
Description of the situation:
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources
that the house of Mr. Nabeel Rajab, President of the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights (BCHR) and Secretary
General of FIDH, was attacked by tear gas on May 21, 2011. 
 
According to the information received, in the early
morning of May 21, 2011, while the whole Rajab family was still asleep,
tear-gas
bombs were shot into the house, breaking the window where Mr. Nabeel Rajab's
brother, Nader Rajab, lives with his family. Nobody could see the attackers.
The family had to rescue Mr. Nader Rajab, his wife and daughter who were
suffocating in the room. 
 
The Observatory fears
that this attack against Mr. Nabeel Rajab's house was launched in order to
pressure him to stop his human rights activities. Mr. Rajab did not file a
complaint for fear of reprisals.
 
The Observatory recalls
that in March 2011 Mr. Nabeel Rajab had been abducted and abused by the police
forces. After more than one hour of physical and psychological abuse, the
police drove him back home. 
 
Actions requested:
 
The Observatory urges the authorities of Bahrain to: 
 
i.        
Guarantee the physical and
psychological integrity of Mr. Nabeel Rajab and his family as well as all human
rights defenders in Bahrain;
 
ii.      
Order a prompt, thorough and impartial
investigation into the circumstances of the above-mentioned events in order to
identify those responsible, bring them to trial and apply the penal and/or
administrative sanctions as provided by law;
 
iii.     
Put an end to any acts of
harassment, including at the judicial and administrative level, against Mr.
Nabeel Rajab as well as against all human rights defenders in Bahrain; 
 
iv.     Conform in any circumstances with the provisions of the Declaration on
Human Rights Defenders, adopted on December 9, 1998 by the United Nations
General Assembly, in particular :
-         
its Article 1, which states that
“everyone has the right, individually or in association with others, to promote
the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the
national and international levels” ;
-         
and its Article 12.2 which states
that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by
the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with
others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse
discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his
or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present
Declaration”;
 
v.      
 Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and
fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards
and international instruments ratified by Bahrain.
