New information: The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources that five of the seven members of Women of Zimbabwe Arise (WOZA) being held at Bulawayo Central Police Station have been charged and released, while Ms. Jenni Williams, WOZA National Coordinator, and Ms. Magodonga Mahlangu, another WOZA leader, remain detained without charge. According to the information received, on June 8, 2007, Ms. Rosemary Sibiza, Ms. Angeline Karuru, Ms. Martha Ncube, Ms. Sangeliso Dhlamini and Ms. Pretty Moyo were charged under Section 46 of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) as read with Section 2(v) of the schedule to the Criminal Code: “employs any means whatsoever which are likely materially to interfere with the ordinary comfort, convenience, peace or quiet of the public or any section of the public, or does any act which is likely to create a nuisance or obstruction”. They were taken to court on the same day but finally did not appear before the magistrate, before being released. However, as of issuing this urgent appeal, Ms. Jenni Williams and Ms. Magodonga Mahlangu, who handed themselves to the police station in solidarity with these five WOZA members, had not yet been fingerprinted nor interrogated. In addition, they are still not allowed to meet their lawyers, while no charges were officially pronounced against them. They might however be taken to court on June 9, 2007. These seven women had been arrested on June 6, 2007, after having peacefully demonstrated through Bulawayo to launch WOZA campaign, called “Ten steps to a new Zimbabwe”[1] (See background information). The Observatory welcomes the release of Ms. Rosemary Sibiza, Ms. Angeline Karuru, Ms. Martha Ncube, Ms. Sangeliso Dhlamini and Ms. Pretty Moyo but recalls that they remain arbitrarily prosecuted. Furthermore, the Observatory strongly condemns the arbitrary detention of Ms. Jenni Williams and Ms. Magodonga Mahlangu and fears that they might be subjected to further ill-treatments while in custody. Background information: On June 6, 2007, around 200 WOZA members decided to undertake a peaceful and silent march through Bulawayo to launch their campaign called “Ten steps to a new Zimbabwe”, as well as to express their concern that Zimbabwean civil society was excluded from the ongoing dialogue initiated by the Southern African Development Community (SADC) between the Zimbabwe African National Union Patriotic Front (Zanu PF) and the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) mediated by the Southern African President Mr. Thabo Mbeki. Indeed, WOZA fears that pertinent issues on the social and economic crisis or human rights violations and democracy be given little attention. It is reported that a group of participants was violently dispersed by the riot police after walking only one block. A second group managed to march two blocks, but was also dispersed by riot police. Ms. Sibiza, Karuru, Ncube, Dhlamini and Moyo, who had been badly beaten with baton sticks, were arrested and detained at Bulawayo Central Police Station. Informed of these facts, another group of around 100 women led by Ms. Jenni Williams went to the police station and offered themselves for arrest. The police officers then assaulted the women, before arresting Ms. Jenni Williams and Ms. Magodonga Mahlangu. Following the arrest of the WOZA members, Mr. Kossam Ncube, a lawyer and a member of the Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights (ZLHR), went to the police station to represent them. A police officer verbally abused him while asking the reasons of his presence there, and accused him of being “unethical” and “irresponsible”. The policeman then pushed him out. On June 7, 2007, Mr. Ncube was again denied access to his clients.

It hopes for a new Constitution according to which elections are conducted with the purpose of having a more inclusive political scene where all political parties, NGO’s, private sector, religious leaders, workers, youth and women are represented. Finally, it intends civil servants, law enforcement individuals and members of the judicial branch to be held accountable through audit inspection units.
