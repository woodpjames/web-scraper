The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of
the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and the International Federation
for Human Rights (FIDH), requests your urgent intervention in the following
situation in India. 
 
Brief
description of the information:
 
The
Observatory has been informed by Banglar Manabadhikar Suraksha Mancha
(MASUM)[1]
about the harassment and intimidation of Mr. Mohar Ali Mondal, District Human Rights Monitor for MASUM in the village of Gobindapur, by officers of the Swarupnagar police
station.
 
According to the information received, on July 27, 2014, at around 10 pm,
Mr. Mohar Ali Mondal accompanied a villager from Gobindapur named Mr. Siddik
Mondal to the Swarupnagar police station to lodge a
formal complaint about an attack against his nephew, Mr. Kabirul Mondal. At
approximately 8pm, the latter had been attacked and severely beaten by a group
of cross-border cattle smugglers that allegedly receives support and protection
from the Swarupnagar police station (District-24, North) and Border
Security Forces (BSF).
 
Upon arrival at the police station, Messrs. Mohar
Ali Mondal and Siddik Mondal were forced to wait one and a half hours for the
arrival of the police sub-inspector, Mr. Bajlur Rahman. Upon arrival, Mr.
Bajlur Rahman read the complaint to a superior officer over his mobile phone.
As Messrs. Mohar Ali Mondal and Siddik Mondal were about to leave the police
station, Mr. Bajlur Rahman ordered them to return to a room with him and two
other officers. Once in the room, Mr. Bajlur Rahman grabbed Mr. Mohar Ali
Mondal’s collar and threatened him, saying “you have to face consequences for
your involvement with human rights” and “you have to pay for your involvement
against police and BSF”.
 
Other villagers were forced to leave the police
station while Messrs. Mohar Ali Mondal and Siddik Mondal were detained and
forced to stand for 40 minutes before being eventually released. Before being released, the police forced both men to sign a
document (an “arrest cum inspection memo”) stating that they had been arrested
and charged; however, the police have not informed the men of why they were
arrested nor informed them of any charges being brought against them.
 
On July 28, 2014, Mr. Mohar Ali Mondal lodged written
complaints to the District Magistrate and Superintendent of Police, 24 Parganas
(North), requesting legal action against the police officers as well as
measures for his security.
 
The Observatory is greatly concerned by this incident,
which seems merely aimed at sanctioning the human rights activities of Mr. Mohar Ali Mondal. More
generally, this incident appears to be part of a pattern of harassment and
intimidation by the police aimed at silencing those who speak up against the
use of torture and ill-treatment by the police and the BSF.
 
Actions requested:

Please write to the authorities in India, urging them to:

i. Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity
of Mr. Mohar Ali Mondal as well as of all MASUM members and human rights
defenders in India;
 
ii. Carry
out an immediate, thorough, impartial and transparent investigation into the above-mentioned
events in order to identify all those responsible, bring them before an
independent tribunal, and sanction them as provided by the law;
 
iii.
Put an end to any act of harassment against Mr. Mohar Ali Mondal, and all human
rights defenders in India, and ensure in all circumstances that they are able
to carry out their legitimate activities without any hindrance or fear of
reprisals or intimidation;
 
iv.
Conform to the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders,
adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998,
especially:
-       
Article 1, which states
that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to
promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and
fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”;
-       
Article 2, which
requires the State to provide the legal guarantees required to ensure that all
persons under its jurisdiction, individually and in association with others,
are able to enjoy all those rights and freedoms in practice”;
-       
Article 9.1, which holds
that everyone has the right to a remedy for violation of human rights and the
right to be protected if human rights are violated;
-       
Article 11, which
guarantees the right to participate in one’s chosen profession and requires
those who are capable of affecting human rights, i.e. police and border patrol,
to respect those rights and freedoms and to comply with relevant national and
international standards of occupational and professional conduct or ethics
-       
Article 12.2, which
provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection
by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with
others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse
discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his
or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present
Declaration”.

v. Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental
freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and
international instruments ratified by India.
