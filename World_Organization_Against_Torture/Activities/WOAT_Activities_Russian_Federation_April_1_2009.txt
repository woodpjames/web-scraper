Brief description of the situation: The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources of the assault against Mr. Lev Ponomarev, Executive Director of the All-Russia Public Movement “For Human Rights”. According to the information received, on March 31, 2009, at around 11 pm, unidentified individuals brutally beat up Mr. Lev Ponomarev, in the surroundings of his home. They had reportedly been waiting for him near the entrance of the building. As the concierge appeared, the attackers escaped. Mr. Ponomarev was then brought to the hospital n°36, and then discharged. As of issuing this urgent appeal, he remained under medical observation. Furthermore, on the eve of the assault, the tyres of his car had been pierced. Mr. Ponomarev had noted that he had been followed on several occasions throughout 2008. On December 28, 2008 for example, he was tracked on his way back home. He had reported these events to the law enforcement agencies, which have not taken any action so far. The Observatory believes that this assault might be related to his human rights activities, and urges the Russian authorities to carry out an immediate, thorough and impartial investigation into all the above-mentioned facts, in order to identify all those responsible for the assault against Mr. Ponomarev and bring them in the shortest delays before a competent and impartial tribunal. The Observatory recalls that according to OP 2(iv.) of the Council of Europe (CoE) Declaration on Human Rights Defenders[1], member-States shall “take effective measures to prevent attacks on or harassment of human rights defenders, ensure independent and effective investigation of such acts and to hold those responsible accountable through administrative measures and/or criminal proceedings”. Accordingly, the Observatory calls upon the Commissioner for Human Rights of the CoE to act in accordance with operative paragraph 4 of the CoE Declaration on Human Rights Defenders with regards to this situation. The Observatory further urges the European Commission Delegation as well as European Union (EU) Member-States embassies in the Russian Federation to call upon the Russian authorities to comply with the relevant international norms and standards and take action in the light of the above-mentioned elements, in line with the EU Guidelines on Human Rights Defenders. The Observatory recalls that the Russian Federation was elected to the Human Rights Council in June 2006 for three years and is committed, in this regard, to “uphold the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights”. In addition, as a participating State of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the Russian Federation acknowledges that “the [1998] UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders [... places] a responsibility [...] on states to [...] provide for a conducive environment for human rights defenders to promote and strive for the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, and recognises “the need for particular attention, support and protection for human rights defenders by the OSCE, its Institutions and field operations, as well as by participating States”[2]. Actions requested: The Observatory urges the authorities of the Russian Federation to:   Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Lev Ponomarev, as well as all human rights defenders in the Russian Federation;  Carry out an immediate, effective, thorough and impartial investigation into the above-mentioned assault against Mr. Lev Ponomarev, the result of which must be made public, in order to identify all those responsible, bring them before a competent , independent and impartial tribunal and apply to them the penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions provided by the law;  Put an end to all acts of harassment against Mr. Lev Ponomarev as well as against all human rights defenders in the Russian Federation, and ensure in all circumstances that they be able to carry out their work without unjustified hindrances; Comply with all the provisions of the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, in particular with Article 1, which provides that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, as well as with Article 12.2 (“the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”);  Comply with the provisions of the Document of the Copenhagen Meeting of the 2nd Conference on the Human Dimension of the Cooperation and Security Conference in Europe (CSCE) (1990), and uphold in all circumstances the principles and provisions enshrined in the international and regional human rights instruments ratified by the Russian Federation and which, in particular, guarantee freedoms of association, demonstration, expression and opinion, in particular the European Convention on Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights;  More generally, ensure in all circumstances the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with international and regional human rights instruments ratified by the Russian Federation.
