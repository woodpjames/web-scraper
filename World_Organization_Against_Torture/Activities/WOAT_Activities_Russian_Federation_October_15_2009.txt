Description of the situation: The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources of acts of harassment faced by ETHnICS, a youth group based in Krasnodar promoting tolerance, and in particular its President Ms. Anastasia Denisova, who is also a member of the Krasnodar section of the Memorial Human Rights Centre and a member of the coordination council of the Youth for Human Rights movement. According to the information received, on October 12, 2009 at 4.30 pm, agents belonging to the Investigation and Intervention Unit on Tax Offence pertaining to the Ministry of Internal Affairs raided the ETHnICS centre in Krasnodar and confiscated three central units, alleging they had received information according to which pirate softwares were being used in the office. The agents presented a warrant bearing an incorrect address and asked Ms. Anastasia Denisova to come with them for interrogation. She refused to follow them, claiming that the reasons for the interrogation had not been clearly stated. The Observatory expresses its deepest concern with the above-mentioned acts of harassment, which seem to have been carried out in violation of Russian legislation and to be aimed at hindering the human rights activities of Ms. Anastasia Denisova. As a matter of fact, over the past weeks, Ms. Anastasia Denisova had been the subject of several acts of harassment. Indeed, at the end of August 2009, Ms. Denisova and one of her colleagues, photo-correspondent Yuriy Ivaschenko, were stopped at the border on their way from Abkhasia, and interrogated during seven hours without any reason being provided. On September 30, 2009, an article published in a Krasnodar administration newspaper accused Ms. Anastasia Denisova of inciting national strife and hate through her writings on xenophobia in the region and her activities in support of Georgian-Russian dialogue. On October 4, 2009, Ms. Anastasia Denisova was prevented from attending the Human Dimension Implementation Meeting (HDIM) of the Organisation for the Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to be held in Warsaw, Poland. At Krasnodar airport, she was stopped after the customs by the Krasnodar airport Security Services Officer Boris Dombrovski, who stated several times that he was following “orders”, and asked her to check in her hand luggage that contained her laptop in the baggage hold. She refused arguing that her laptop was fragile. Ms. Denisova was denied boarding with her laptop in cabin, and could not take part in the OSCE HDIM. Actions requested: Please write to the Russian authorities and ask them to:   Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Ms. Anastasia Denisova, all members of ETHnICS as well as all human rights defenders in the Russian Federation;  Immediately and unconditionally return the confiscated equipment to ETHnICS;  Put an end to all acts of harassment against Ms. Anastasia Denisova, ETHnICS, its members as well as all human rights defenders in the Russian Federation;  Conform in any circumstances with the provisions of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted on December 9, 1998 by the United Nations General Assembly, in particular its article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually or in association with others, to promote the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, and its article 12.2 which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”;  Comply with the provisions of the Document of the Copenhagen Meeting of the 2nd Conference on the Human Dimension of the Cooperation and Security Conference in Europe (CSCE) (1990), as well as with OP 2(iv.) of the Council of Europe Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, according to which member-States shall “take effective measures to prevent attacks on or harassment of human rights defenders, ensure independent and effective investigation of such acts and to hold those responsible accountable through administrative measures and/or criminal proceedings”;  Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by the Russian Federation.
