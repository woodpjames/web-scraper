The Observatory for the Protection of Human
Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the International Federation for Human
Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent intervention in the following
situation in Thailand.
 
Description of the situation:
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable
sources about the judicial harassment against Mr. Anon Nampa, a volunteer
lawyer with the organization Thai Lawyers for Human Rights (TLHR). TLHR was
established by a group of lawyers in May 2014 to provide legal assistance to
alleged lèse-majesté violators and activists targeted by the authorities
following the 22 May military coup. Although in existence for less than a year,
TLHR received a human rights award by the French Embassy in Bangkok in December
2014. Besides his work for TLHR, Mr. Anon has defended numerous individuals
accused of lèse-majesté under Article 112 of the Criminal Code or under the
provisions of the Computer Crimes Act since 2010.
 
According to the information received, on March
5, 2015, Mr. Anon reported to the Pathumwan police station in Bangkok to
respond to a complaint filed by Lt Col Burin Thongprapai, an official at the
Judge Advocate General’s Department, on February 25, 2015. Lt Col Burin accused Mr.
Anon of “importing into a computer false information which may damage national
security” under Article 14(2) of the Computer Crimes Act for posting five
Facebook messages that criticized the role of the military in the
administration of justice under martial law. If prosecuted and found guilty,
Mr. Anon faces up to 25 years in jail and a fine of up to 500,000 Thai baht
(approximately 14,135 Euros).
 
Mr. Anon posted the five messages on Facebook
while in police custody on February 14, 2015. On that day, police arrested Mr.
Anon, along with three anti-coup activists, on charges of violating National
Council for Peace and Order’s (NCPO’s) order No. 7/2014, which prohibits public
gatherings of more than five people. The four were arrested while they were in
the process of organizing an event at the Bangkok Cultural and Art Center to
mark the one-year anniversary of the annulled Thai general election on February
2, 2014. All four were released on bail after being detained and interrogated
for more than nine hours at the Pathumwan police station.
 
The
Observatory strongly condemns the judicial harassment against Mr. Anon Nampa,
which only aims at sanctioning his legitimate human rights activities. The
Observatory calls on Thai authorities to drop all charges held against him and
put an immediate end to this judicial harassment.
 
Actions requested:
 
Please write
to the authorities of Thailand asking them to:
 
i.      Drop
all charges against Mr. Anon Nampa and put an end to all acts of judicial
harassment against him and all human rights defenders in Thailand;
 
ii.     Guarantee
in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Anon, as well as all human rights
defenders in Thailand;
 
iii.   Conform
with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by
the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its
Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in
association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and
realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and
international levels”, and Article 12.2, which provides that “the State shall
take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent
authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against
any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination,
pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her
legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”;
 
iv.    Ensure
in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in
accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments
ratified by Thailand.
