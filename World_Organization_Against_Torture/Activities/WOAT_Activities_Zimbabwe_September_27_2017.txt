Arbitrary arrest /
Release / 
Judicial harassment
Zimbabwe
September 27, 2017
 
The Observatory
for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a partnership of FIDH and
the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent
intervention in the following situation in Zimbabwe.
 
New
information:
 
The Observatory
has been informed by reliable sources about the arbitrary arrest,
subsequent release and ongoing judicial harassment against Pastor Evan Mawarire, prominent anti-corruption activist who led last
year’s #ThisFlag[1]
protests which encouraged Zimbabweans via social media to hold protests against
President Robert Mugabe, accusing him of corruption and causing the economic crisis.                       
 
According to the information received, on September 24, 2017, Pastor
Mawarire was arbitrarily arrested during a church service in Milton Park and
subsequently detained at Harare central police station. Pastor Mawarire had
initially been charged with “subverting a constitutional government” under
Section 22 (2) of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act, Chapter 9:23.
 
These charges stem from a video circulated on social media on September
23, 2017, in which Pastor Mawarire criticised Zimbabwe’s economic policies and
urged Zimbabweans to revolt against them[2].
 
Pastor Mawarire was taken to the Prosecutor General’s office on
September 26, 2017. On the same day Harare Magistrates Court, ordered his
release on the ground that under the Constitution of Zimbabwe, no one can be
detained more than 48 hours without appearing before a court of law. Charges
related to his arrest were consequently dropped.
 
However, Pastor Mawarire is still facing trial as similar charges were levelled
against him in February 2017, for leading demonstrations and demanding an end
to corruption and the economic crisis (see background information). Pastor
Mawarire appeared in court on September 25, 2017 and pleaded not guilty. The
next hearing is scheduled on September 28, 2017.
 
The Observatory condemns the ongoing harassment, including at the
judicial level, against Pastor Mawarire, which seems only to be aimed at sanctioning his
legitimate human rights activities and urges authorities to immediately and
unconditionally release him.
 
Background
information:

In July 2016, Pastor Mawarire was arrested and charged with “inciting
public violence”. The public prosecutor then altered the charges to “attempting
to overthrow a constitutional government”. However, the Harare Magistrate Vakai
Chikwekwe ruled that Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) officers had violated his
constitutional rights in arresting and detaining him and that the prosecutor
acted in violation of the Constitution by bringing new charges against Pastor
Mawarire while in court.
 
President Mugabe himself publicly attacked Pastor Mawarire accusing him
of being a “great shame” and a “disgrace” for “allowing himself to demonstrate
against the country”.
 
Fearing to be further harassed and arrested, Pastor Mawarire, left on a
self-imposed exile to the United States for seven months.
 
Pastor Mawarire returned to Zimbabwe on February 1, 2017 and was
immediately arrested at the airport and charged by the ZRP with “subverting a
constitutional government”[3]. The ZRP claims that the
cleric has been “inciting Zimbabweans from all walks of life either locally or
internationally to revolt and overthrow a constitutionally elected government”.
That includes allegations that Pastor Evan Mawarire has incited some
Zimbabweans living in the US and “all over the world” through social media to
converge in New York on September 22, 2016 to “confront” President Mugabe, who
was attending the United Nations General Assembly and order him to
“immediately” resign from his position under the accusation of destroying the
country.
 
On February 8, 2017, the Harare High Court acceded to a bail request and
granted a USD 300 (280 euros) bail to Pastor Mawarire, after finding the
State’s case “weak”, with “no compelling reasons” to maintain him in pre-trial
detention. The bail was accompanied by the obligation to report twice a week
(on Mondays and Fridays) to the Arondale police station. In addition, Pastor
Mawarire had to surrender his passport to the Clerk of the Harare Magistrates
Court and was urged not to interfere with State witnesses.
 
Furthermore, the High Court found extensive periods of pre-trial detention
to be in contradiction with provisions of the Zimbabwean Constitution, the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights as well as with opinions
of the United Nations Human Rights Committee, and the European Court of
Justice.

[1]                                The #ThisFlag movement started after Pastor Evan
Mawarire posted a video on Facebook in which he appeared with the Zimbabwean
flag around his neck and denounced the country’s worsening economic crisis.


[2]                In his address, Pastor Mawarire
said, “What did we do to deserve this suffering nhai? There is no evil that
surpasses that of enriching yourself at the expense of poor defenceless people.
The extent of suffering in Zimbabwe is heartbreaking and our leaders see
nothing wrong with it. God is not a fool and He will bring judgement. We will
not stop speaking out and condemning evil and injustice. I’m not going to sit
around and just let it happen all over again. Things are getting worse and we
are the ones suffering. Please people of Zimbabwe let's save our nation.”
