The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint
programme of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and
the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent
intervention in the following situation in
Egypt.
 
Description of the situation:
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the
arbitrary detention and confirmation of the sentencing of Ms. Mahienour
El-Massry, a human rights lawyer known for her activism in favour of
judicial independence and prisoners' rights by organising peaceful protests,
using social media to denounce human rights violations and organising support
activities for political prisoners, following her participation in a peaceful
protest aimed at denouncing police repression in Egypt, as well as the
repression of a peaceful demonstration to call for her release. 
 
According to the information received, on May 20, 2014, the Sidi
Gaber Misdemeanour Court in Alexandria rejected the objection filed by Ms.
Manhienour El-Massry regarding the sentence issued against
her in absentia on January 2, 2014, convicting her to two years’
imprisonment and a fine of EGP 50,000 (approximately EUR 5,143). She was
sentenced for 
“protest
without a permit” and “assaulting security forces”. Ms. Mahienour El-Massry was
immediately detained following the hearing.
 
The
charges were brought against Ms. Mahienour El-Massry and seven other members of
the political group “Revolutionary Socialists”[1],
including human rights lawyer Mr. Hassan Mustafa[2],
after they organised a protest on December 2, 2013 related to Khaled Saeed
murder's retrial. Khaled Saeed was killed by police forces on June 6, 2012 and
subsequently became a symbol of police repression during the 2011 Egyptian
Revolution. The eight defendants were first convicted on January 2, 2014 by
Alexandria Manshiya Misdemeanour Court.
 
The
appeal to the May 20 decision of Ms. Maheinour El-Massry has been scheduled for
June 26, 2014. According to her lawyers, the appeal date is too far away in
violation of criminal law procedural provisions. Therefore, the lawyers will
file on May 22, 2014 a request for an earlier appeal date. Meanwhile, Ms.
Maheinour El-Massry remains detained in Damanhour prison. 
 
Moreover, Ms. El-Massry is also facing trial on separate charges for an
incident that occurred in March 2013. The case was only referred to court on
May 8, 2014, but the appointed judge resigned from the bench, and the next
hearing before a different circuit is scheduled for June 16, 2014. Ms.
El-Massry is charged in this case with “assaulting security forces”, after she
and other lawyers went to Raml police station to provide legal assistance to
three activists who were arrested and sent to the police by supporters of the
Muslim Brotherhood. The lawyers were attacked by the police in the police
station, and Ms. El-Massry was detained briefly before the Prosecution decided
to release her and the others.
 
Finally, on May 22, 2014, the Egyptian security forces violently
repressed participants to a solidarity march organised outside of the
headquarters of the Egyptian Center for Economic & Social Rights (ECESR) in
Alexandria, following a press conference organised to show support for Ms. Mahienour
El-Massry, Once the march ended, the security forces stormed into ECESR’s
headquarters twice, smashed its contents and arrested its employers. In the
meantime, activists who participated in the march were chased on the side
streets.
 
Messrs. Mohamed Ramadan and Mohamed Hafez, lawyers of the
Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI) in Alexandria, were among
those beaten and arrested by the police, as well as other human rights activists
defenders and political activists, including Messrs. Mohamed Mokhtar, Essam Al-Mahdy, Magdy Al-Naqeeb, Khaled Salah Al-DIn (Khaled Touson),
Mohamed Khalil, Mustafa Qamar, Yousef Al-Saeed (a minor), Mustafa
Al-Sayyed Eissa (ECESR photographer),
Islam Mamdouh, Abdullah Al-Naggar, Ahmed Abdel-Salam Mahmoud, Metry Mouhab
Gebrial, Mohamed Awad (lawyer at ECESR), Taher Mokhtar (member of
Doctors’ Syndicate), Moamen Habiba, Hesham Essam (a minor), Mohamed
Al-Shafie, Ahmed Misho, Mostafa Anwar, and Ms. Isis Khalil (a journalist) and Ms. Riham Helmi. 
 
They were detained in Alexandria Security Directorate. Then they were released after seizing the case’s file of Ms. Mahienour
El-Massry along with the clearance that was issued by security bodies to some
activists in order to visit the activist in the prison. Some other documents
were also impounded. 
The case of Ms. Maheinour Al Masry is illustrative of a wider repression
campaign targeting human rights defenders opposing the current regime in the
country since the “Protest Law”[3]
was passed in November 2013. This controversial law bans gathering of 10 or
more people without a permit issued by the authorities. Based on this law,
Founders of the April 6 Youth Movement, Mr. Ahmed Maher and Mr. Mohamed
Adel, were also sentenced to three years of prison and a 50,000 EGP fine by
the Cairo Criminal Court on December 22, 2013 for organising an unauthorised
protest and allegedly attacking police forces in November 2013[4].

 
The Observatory expresses its concern regarding the conviction and
ongoing arbitrary detention of Ms. Mahienour El-Massry, which seems to aim only
at preventing her from carrying out her peaceful human rights activities, and
calls upon the Egyptian judicial authorities to immediately and unconditionally
release her.
 
Actions requested:
 
Please write to the authorities of Egypt asking them to:
 
i.              
Guarantee in all
circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Ms. Mahienour
El-Massry and all human rights defenders in Egypt;
 
ii.             
Release Ms. Mahienour El-Massry immediately and unconditionally, as well as all human rights defenders currently in detention, since their detention is arbitrary as it seems to only aim at curtailing
their human rights activities; 
 
iii.           
Put an end to all acts
of harassment, including at the judicial level, against Ms. Mahienour El-Massry
and all human rights defenders in Egypt;
 
iv.    Comply with all the provisions of the United Nations Declaration on
Human Rights Defenders, in particular with:
-     
its Article 1, which
provides that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with
others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realization of human
rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”;
-     
its Article 5(a): “For
the purpose of promoting and protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms,
everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, at the

its Article 6(a), which
foresees that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with
others, to participate in peaceful activities against violations of human
rights and fundamental freedoms”;
-     
its Article 12.2, which
provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the
protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in
association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de
facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other
arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the
rights referred to in the present Declaration”;
