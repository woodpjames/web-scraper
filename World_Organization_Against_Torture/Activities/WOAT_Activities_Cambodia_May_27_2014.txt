The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of
the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and the International Federation
for Human Rights (FIDH), requests your urgent intervention in the following
situation in Cambodia.
 
Brief description of the situation:
 
The Observatory has been informed by the Cambodian Center for Human
Rights (CCHR) about the arbitrary arrest and judicial harassment of eight members of
the Coalition of the Cambodian Apparel Workers’ Democratic Union (CCAWDU) in
Bati district, Takeo province, during a strike to ask for better working conditions at the garment factory JSD Textile
Co. Ltd Factory.
 
According to the information received, on May 23, 2014, at around 4 pm,
Messrs. Seang Yot and Sot Seam, two CCAWDU members based in Phnom Penh, as
well as Messrs. Phin Sot, Keo Bouen, No Sak, Ol Sam
Oeun, Seng Soeun and
Ms. Chhem Sreypov, six CCAWDU members based in Kandal province, were arrested by Takeo
provincial police during a peaceful strike at the garment factory JSD Textile
Co. Ltd Factory. The strikers were demanding better working conditions such as
to provide 50% of salary and stipend for female workers who are on maternity
leave, to use the National Social Security Fund in case of accident at work, to
provide salary for sick workers, to stop using short-term contracts for
workers, as well as to not discriminate workers who are members of the union.
 
The eight trade unionists were held
at Takeo provincial police station without access to their lawyers until they
were brought before Takeo Provincial Court for interrogation on May 24, 2014. They were then charged with “instigating a felony”
(Article 28 of the Criminal Code), “incitement” (Article 495), “threats to
cause damage” (Article 423) and “discrediting a judicial decision” (Article
523).
 
When lawyers and some representatives of
non-governmental organisations requested access to the eight detainees in the
police station and in the courthouse, armed security forces with barbed wire
denied access to them.
 
The eight were released on bail on May 25, 2014 in the evening after the
President of CCAWDU signed a letter guaranteeing that the eight would not cause
trouble at the factory and present themselves when requested by the Prosecutor.
 
The
Observatory expresses its concern about the arbitrary arrest an judicial
harassment against Messrs. Seang
Yot, Sot Seam, Phin Sot, Keo Bouen, No Sak, Ol Sam Oeun, Seng Soeun, and Ms.
Chhem Sreypov, which take place in the
context of a systematic crackdown against workers and trade unionists since
January 2014, and calls upon the Cambodian authorities to end their
judicial harassment.
 
The
Observatory further recalls the UN Human Rights Council resolutions 19/35
(preambular para. 11) and 22/10 (preambular para. 16), stressing that “peaceful
protests should not be viewed as a threat, and therefore […] all States
[should] engage in an open, inclusive and meaningful dialogue when dealing with
peaceful protests and their causes”.
