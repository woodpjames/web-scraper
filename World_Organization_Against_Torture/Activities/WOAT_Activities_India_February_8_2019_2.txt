The Observatory for the Protection of
Human Rights Defenders, a partnership of the World Organisation Against Torture
(OMCT) and FIDH, requests your urgent intervention in the following situation
in India.
 
Brief description
of the information:
 
The Observatory has been informed by Banglar Manabadhikar Suraksha
Mancha (MASUM)[1]
about acts of harassment and intimidation by personnel of the Border Security Force (BSF) against several
members of MASUM in the village of Hatkhola in
Chapra, Nadia district, West Bengal State, close to the border with
Bangladesh.
 
According to the information received, on February 2, 2019, Chapra
police registered a criminal case against Mr. Kirity
Roy, MASUM Secretary, MASUM
members Mr. Ramen Moitra, Mr. Subhrangshu Bhaduri and Mr. Sujoy
Singh Roy, and the driver of a car hired by MASUM, Mr. Ganesh Sarkar, under Sections 186
(“obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions”), 323
(“punishment for voluntarily causing hurt”), 345 (“wrongful confinement of
person for whose liberation writ has been issued”), 506 (“punishment for
criminal intimidation”) and 509 (“word, gesture or act intended to insult the
modesty of a woman”) of the Indian Penal Code. The case was filed after the
defenders had taken part in a meeting earlier that day with more than 150
villagers who reported acts of torture allegedly committed on a daily basis by
members of the ‘A’ Company of the 81st Battalion of the BSF, which is posted at
the Mahakhola Border Outpost (BOP) under the jurisdiction of the Chapra police
station in Nadia district. 
 
At
around 2.15 pm, shortly after the meeting had ended,
MASUM members noticed approximately 100 villagers waiting beside the
road for the border gates to be opened at 3pm by the BSF so that they could
return home[2]. Mr. Roy
approached BSF Head Constable Mr. Jay Bhagwan, who was guarding gate number 10
of the Mahakhola BOP, and asked him to open
the gate. The latter refused and asked Mr. Roy to show his identity card.
Another BSF officer, Mr. Sanjay, also refused to open the gate, and both men
subsequently tried to confiscate the mobile phones of the MASUM members present
at the scene. 
 
After
a short period of time, the Commander of the ‘A’
Company, Mr. S N Sharma, arrived and started pushing and shoving the people who
had gathered there. He told MASUM members that they had come to the village “to
create disorder”, before he and another BSF Company Commander, Mr. Rajveer
Singh, started taking video footage of the scene. Company Commander Mr. S N
Sharma then called the Chapra police station of Nadia district and complained
to the Officer-in-Charge that human rights activists were trying to instigate
villagers to commit violence and unrest. Mr. Rajveer Singh subsequently wrote
down the names of the four MASUM members who were present, took photographs of
their identity cards, and told them that they should have asked for permission
to come to the village.
 
Around
3pm, MASUM members were allowed to leave, after Mr. S N Sharma told them that
if they were to come back again without their permission, they would “face dire
consequences”. At around 4.30pm, police officers from the Chapra police station
came and collected information from villagers.
 
Two
hours later, Messrs. Kirity Roy,
Ramen Moitra, Subhrangshu Bhaduri, Sujoy Singh Roy
and Ganesh Sarkar were informed that Chapra
police had registered a criminal case against them after BSF Commander Mr. S.N
Sharma lodged a written complaint to the Chapra police station.
 
On
February 3, 2019, Mr. Roy filed a written complaint with the Officer-in-Charge
of Chapra police station to denounce the BSF’s behaviour.
 
The Observatory condemns the above-mentioned acts of harassment and intimidation
against MASUM members, which seem to be only aimed at punishing them for
documenting and denouncing grave human rights violations allegedly involving
members of the police forces and BSF, and recalls that several members of MASUM
have already faced reprisals in the past because of their human rights
activities[3].

 
The Observatory calls upon the Indian authorities to put an end to all
acts of harassment, intimidation, and criminalization of all MASUM members, as
well as of all human rights defenders in India.
 
Actions requested: 
 
Please write to the authorities in India, urging them to:
 
i. Guarantee, in all circumstances, the physical integrity and
psychological well-being of all the members of MASUM as well as of all
human rights defenders in India;
 
ii. Put an end to all acts of harassment - including at the judicial
level - against all the members of MASUM, as well as
against all human rights defenders in India, and ensure that they are able
to carry out their legitimate activities without any hindrance and fear of
reprisals in all circumstances;
 
iii. Conform to the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights
Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9,
1998, in particular with Articles 1 and 12.2;
 
iv. Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental
freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and
international instruments ratified by India.
