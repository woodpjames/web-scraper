PRESS
RELEASE - THE OBSERVATORY

 
Paris-Geneva, May 27, 2016 - The Observatory for the
Protection of Human Rights Defenders (an FIDH-OMCT partnership) welcomes the
acquittal and subsequent release of Mr.
José Marcos Mavungo, former member of “Mpalabanda”, a civic group banned in
2006 after producing reports highlighting human rights abuses by security
forces in oil-rich but poverty-racked Cabinda province.
 
On May 20,
2016, the Supreme Court of Angola eventually acquitted Mr. José Marcos
Mavungo after concluding that there was insufficient evidence to uphold
accusations of “rebellion” against him.
 
“While we welcome the long-awaited
acquittal and release of José Marcos Mavungo, we strongly deplore the judicial harassment which led to his arbitrary
detention for more than a year”,
our organisations said today.                                                 
 
Mr. Mavungo
had been arrested on March 14, 2015 for helping out on organising a peaceful
demonstration promoting human rights and denouncing bad governance in Cabinda
province. On May 27, 2015, he was formally charged with “rebellion”, but was
only informed of his indictment on June 22. His trial started on August 25 and
was marred with several irregularities. On September 14, 2015, he was convicted
to six years' imprisonment by the Cabinda Provincial Court on charges of
“rebellion”.
 
The
Observatory recalls that, as mentioned in its Mission
Report issued in March 2015, human rights defenders
and journalists remain widely exposed to judicial harassment, acts of
intimidation, threats and other restrictions to their freedom of association
and expression in Angola.
The sentencing of 16 pro-democracy activists on March 28, 2016 by the Luanda
Provincial Tribunal to jail terms ranging from two years and three months to
eight years and six months for the alleged crimes of “preparatory acts of
rebellion” (Article 21 of the Criminal Code) and “association of criminals”
(Article 263), among other charges is emblematic of the criminalisation of
human rights defenders. To date, they remain in arbitrary detention[1].
 
The
Observatory calls upon the Angolan authorities to release all arbitrarily
detained human rights defenders, and to conform in all circumstances with the
United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders and other international
and regional human rights instruments.
 
 
The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders (the Observatory) was
created in 1997 by FIDH and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT). The
objective of this programme is to intervene to prevent or remedy situations of
repression against human rights defenders.
