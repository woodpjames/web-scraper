New information :  The Observatory has been informed by the Human Rights League in Iran that, on March 18th, 2002, Mr. Nasser Zarafchan, who is the lawyer of Mrs. Sima Pouhandeh, the widow of Mohammed Djafar Pouhandeh, (writer and human rights defender, assassinated in 1998) was sentenced by the Military Tribunal of Tehran, to three years imprisonment for “possession of firearms and alcohol”. He was also sentenced to two years imprisonment for the opinions he had expressed during interviews with the press, concerning the trial dealing with the assassinations of Iranian intellectuals, which came to a conclusion in January 2001. Mr. Zarafchan  appealed against the decision of the Tribunal.  Mr. Zarafchan’s trial began on November 3rd, 2001, before the Military Tribunal of Tehran.
