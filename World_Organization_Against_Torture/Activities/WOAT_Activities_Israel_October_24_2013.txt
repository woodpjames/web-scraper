The Observatory for the Protection of Human
Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the World Organisation Against Torture
(OMCT) and the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), has received
new information regarding the following situation in Israel and the Occupied
Palestinian Territory.
 
New information:
 
The Observatory has been informed by the
Addameer Prisoner Support and Human Rights Association about the release on
bail of Mr. Anas Anise Hussein Barghouthi, a Palestinian human rights
lawyer who defends Palestinian political prisoners arrested by Israel and the
Palestinian Authority[1].

 
According to the information received, on
October 22, 2013, the Ofer Military Court
Judge issued an order to release Mr. Anas Barghouthi
on a 12,000 NIS bail (about 2,475 euros), giving the prosecution 24 hours to
appeal this decision. As the military prosecution decided not to appeal the
release order, Mr. Barghouthi was released on October 23, 2013 from Ofer
Military Prison in Betunia at around 9:30pm, after paying the bail.
 
The Observatory welcomes the Ofer Military Court Judge’s decision, and
thanks all the persons, institutions and organisations who intervened in
his favour. However, the Observatory remains concerned that charges remain
pending against Mr. Barghouthi, which seem to be directly linked to
his human rights activities, and urges the Israeli authorities to put an end to all acts of harassment against him.
 
Background
information:
 
On September 15, 2013, at around 7pm, Mr. Anas
Barghouthi was arrested by an
officer of the Israeli General Security Services (Shabak) and four Israeli army
soldiers as he was attempting to cross the “Container” military checkpoint between Bethlehem and Ramallah, where he was handcuffed and then taken to an interrogation room at the military checkpoint.
Around 9:30pm, he was brought to an interrogation
centre in the settlement of Etzion, in the southern West Bank. In the first 36
hours of arrest, Mr. Anas Barghouthi was fed only twice and was not allowed to
shower or change his clothes neither he was given hygiene products. In
addition, his lawyer was not able to have access to his client during the first
week of his detention.
 
On September 17, 2013, Mr. Anas Barghouthi was transferred
to Ofer Military Complex and presented
to the Military Court of Ofer, which decided to extend his detention without
charges until September 22, 2013, when the detention period was extended again
until September 24. 
 
On September 24, 2013, Mr. Anas Barghouthi was finally charged with the offences of “membership in an unlawful association” (the Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine, an organisation banned by Israel), and “leadership of a committee to organise
demonstrations”, under Articles 85(1)(a) and (b) of the 1945 Defence
(Emergency) Regulations. Mr. Anas Barghouthi denies both charges. A first
hearing was held on October 1, 2013, when the trial was postponed until October
9, 2013. On that day, the trial was again postponed until October 22 because by
the time he was presented to a judge, and despite the fact that Mr. Anas
Barghouthi had been waiting at Ofer Military Court for several hours, he was
informed that the court was closing and it was too late to hold the hearing. 
 
Actions requested:
 
Please write to the authorities of Israel,
urging them to:
 
i. Guarantee in all circumstances the
physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Anas Anise Hussein Barghouthi as

Territory;
 
ii. Put an end to all acts of harassment
- including at the judicial level - against Mr. Anas Barghouthi, as well as
against all human rights defenders and human rights organisations in Israel and
the Occupied Palestinian Territory so that they are able to carry out their work without
unjustified hindrances;
 
iii. Comply with all the provisions of
the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the UN
General Assembly on December 9, 1998, in particular: 
-       its
Article 1, which provides that “everyone has the right, individually and in
association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and
realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and
international levels”, 
-       its
Article 12.2, which states that “the State shall take all necessary measures to
ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually
and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de
facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other
arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the
rights referred to in the present Declaration”;
 
iv. More generally, ensure in all
circumstances the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in
accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with
international human rights instruments ratified by Israel.
