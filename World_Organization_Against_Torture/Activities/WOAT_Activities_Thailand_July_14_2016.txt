The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a partnership of the
World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and FIDH, received new information
and requests your urgent intervention in the following
situation in Thailand. 
New Information:The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the Thai
authorities’ ongoing harassment of Prachatai journalist Mr. Taweesak Kerdpoka after
 his release
from detention on July 11, 2016 (see background information).According 
to the information received, on July 12, 2016, five plainclothes police
officers from  Sutthisan Police Station and
a number of soldiers entered the Prachatai journal premises in Bangkok 
with a
search warrant. While the officials did not confiscate anything, they
thoroughly searched the personal desk of Mr. Taweesak in addition to the
 other
journalists’ desks and individual lockers. The authorities also 
questioned
Prachatai Executive Director Chiranuch Premchaiporn about allegations of
 the
organization’s involvement in printing anti-draft constitution documents
 and other
material produced by the Neo Democracy Movement (NDM)[1].
Ms. Chiranuch denied any involvement of Prachatai in the printing of such
material.
The
Observatory strongly condemns the Thai authorities for this act of intimidation
and harassment towards Mr. Taweesak and all the Prachatai staff, as they are clearly aimed at sanctioning their
legitimate human rights activities, and calls upon the authorities
to immediately and unconditionally put an end to all acts of harassment
against them, as well as against all human rights defenders in the country.
The Observatory calls
on the Thai authorities to drop all charges against Mr. Taweesak under Article
61 of the Referendum Act[2], amend this clause, and repeal the Head of the National
Council for Peace and Order (NCPO) Order no. 3/2558[3]. Article 61 of the Referendum Act and Head of the NCPO Order no. 3/2558
do not comply with international human rights conventions ratified by Thailand,
especially with respect to the right to freedom of expression and the right to
freedom of peaceful assembly.
Until all charges are
dropped, the Observatory urges the Thai authorities to ensure all judicial
proceedings against Mr. Taweesak are carried out in full compliance with his right
to a fair trial, as protected under international law. Furthermore, the
Observatory urges the Thai authorities to grant adequate reparations to human
rights defenders who have been arbitrarily detained.
Background Information: 
On June 23, 2016, at around 5.30pm, 13
NDM activists, namely Messrs. Rangsiman Rome[4], Korakoch Saengyenpan, Anan Loket, Thirayut Napnaram, Rackchart Wong-arthichart, Yuttana
Dasri, Worawut Butmat, Somsakol Thongsuksai, Nantapong Panmat and Misses Tueanjai Waengkham, Pimai Ratwongsa, Konchanok Tanakhun,and Phanthip Saengathit, were arrested by
military personnel at the market of Kan Keha Bang Phli community on the eastern
outskirts of Bangkok in Samut Prakan province, while handing out leaflets that
urged voters to reject the draft constitution in a referendum to be held on
August 7, 2016.
All the activists were apprehended and taken to the Bang Sao Thong police
station and their campaign material was confiscated. They were held in police
custody overnight and were all charged with violating the Head of the NCPO
Order no. 3/2558, which bans gatherings of five or more people, and Article 61
of the 2016 Constitutional Referendum Act, which bans the dissemination of
“false information” about the draft charter with the aim of influencing voters.
If found guilty, all 13 could face up to 10 years’ imprisonment, a fine of up
to 200,000 Baht (approx. 5,125 Euro), and have their right to vote revoked by
court for up to 10 years under the Referendum Act.
On June 24, 2016, the 13 activists were brought to
their pre-trial remand hearing at the Bangkok Military Court, where the police
asked the court to have them remanded for 12 days in order to provide
sufficient time to conduct the investigation, as well as for fear of repetition
of the crime. The court dismissed the motion filed by the defendants’ attorney
to object to the police request and approved the pre-trial remand.
Six
of the activists were released on a bail of 50,000 Baht (approx. 1,280 Euro)
each, under the condition that they do “not get involved with any act aimed to
instigate, disrupt public order, persuade, compel people to rise up by any
means possible in order to make possible any public assembly which may bring
about public disorder or cause any harm or infringement on peace, order or the
moral high ground of the people or any act which may induce people to commit a
legal offence”.
The
other seven activists did not submit bail requests, arguing that they had done
nothing wrong and that they would not accept conditions for their release. They
were remanded in custody at the Bangkok Remand Prison until July 5, 2016, when
the defendants’ attorney was expected to file another motion to object to a
further remand.
On July 6 at
around 8.30am, the
Department of Corrections released six of the seven democracy activists, after on
July 5, 2016, at approximately 3.15pm, the Bangkok Military Court rejected a police request to
extend the detention of the seven activists for another 12 days.
Mr. Korakoch Saengyenpan was not released and
was transported to the Thonburi police station because of previous charges he
faced in connection with another case against 11 pro-democracy activists who
undertook an “advocacy trip” to demand the opening of an investigation
into alleged corruption in the construction of the military-sponsored
Rajabhakti Park in Prachuab Kirikhan province in December 2015[5].
He was finally released on the same day,
July 6, at about 4:30pm. Bail was set at 10,000 Thai baht (approx. 250 Euro).
It has been
reported that the majority of the detainees lost weight during the span of
their custody. Most notably, Mr. Rangsiman Rome is said to have lost at least
10 kg during his 12-day detention.
On
July 10, 2016, at around 11:30am, officers from the Ban Pong police station in
Ratchaburi province detained three other NDM activists, Messrs. Pakorn
Areekul, Anucha Rungmorakot, and Anan Loket, and Prachatai
journalist Mr. Taweesak Kerdpoka for alleged violation of Article 61 of
the Referendum Act, after they searched Mr. Pakorn’s pick-up truck and found
booklets that criticized Thailand’s draft constitution. The three NDM activists
had travelled to the Ban Pong police station to show support for 18 activists
who had been summoned to answer charges of violating the Head of the NCPO no.
3/2558. The charges stemmed from the 18 activists’ participation in a ceremony
to open referendum-monitoring centers in the province on June 16, 2016. Mr.
Taweesak was accompanying the three NDM activists to report on their activity.
University student activist Mr. Phanuwat Songsawadchai, who had attended
the June 16 ceremony, was arrested at his home on the same day at 8:20pm.
On
July 11, 2016, the Ratchaburi Provincial Court granted police permission to
detain the above-mentioned four activists and journalist. However, at around
4:30pm, all five were released, with bail set at 140,000 Thai baht (approx.
3,590 Euro) each.
