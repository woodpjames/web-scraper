Paris-Geneva-New
York, December 18, 2015 - The final adoption of a resolution on the protection
of human rights defenders by the United Nations General Assembly, in its
plenary session, on Thursday December 17, 2015, with 127 States voting in
favour (i.e 10 more than in the Third Committee) was welcomed today by the
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint FIDH-OMCT
(World Organisation Against Torture) programme.
 
At a time when the work of human rights defenders has become
extraordinarily dangerous and increasingly criminalized in many countries, the
Observatory recalls the importance of having a vast majority of Member States
to the United Nations (UN) supporting this resolution, entitled “Recognizing
the role of human rights defenders and the need for their protection”, which
calls for accountability for attacks on human rights defenders (including
attacks on their family members) and urges States to release defenders who have
been arbitrarily detained for exercising their fundamental rights to freedom of
expression, peaceful assembly and association.
 
From restricting the civic space of human rights defenders through laws
undermining basic freedoms such as freedom of expression, freedom of peaceful
assembly and freedom of association to criminalisation and killings, never
since the fall of the Berlin wall had it been more important to protect those
who defend our rights. Repressive States across the planet have been
increasingly misusing vague concepts such as “State security”, the “fight
against terrorism” or the interference of “foreign agents” to justify muzzling
human rights champions. It is high time for all to respect and implement
commitments under the UN Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of
Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and
Fundamental Freedoms (UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders). 
 
127 States supported the resolution, including South Africa, which had
voted against it in the Third Committee, while 14 States (Burundi, Cambodia,
China, Cuba, North Korea, Iran, Myanmar, Nicaragua,
Nigeria, Pakistan, Russia, Sudan, Syria and Zimbabwe)
voted against it.
