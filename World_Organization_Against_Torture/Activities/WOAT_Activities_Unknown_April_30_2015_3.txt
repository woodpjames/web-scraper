As a State party to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment and Punishment, the Republic of Macedonia is obliged to submit every four years a report to the Committee on the measures taken to implement the provisions of the Convention and to ensure the absolute prohibition of torture. The report will be presented by representatives from several ministries who will respond to questions asked by the Committee.The Helsinki Committee for Human Rights in collaboration with the World Organization against Torture (OMCT) and five local non-governmental organizations submitted a shadow report . This report addresses a range of concerns violating the rights guaranteed to victims of torture under the Convention such as:  the inability by public prosecution and courts to recognize acts as torture or other forms of ill-treatment; the ineffective investigation of acts of torture resulting in a climate of impunity; brutal and discriminatory treatment towards marginalized groups by the police, excessive use of force by the special police unit “Alpha”, ineffective internal police control, inhuman conditions in closed institutions, as well as institutional ineffectiveness in dealing with frequent murders of women in relation to  domestic violence.
