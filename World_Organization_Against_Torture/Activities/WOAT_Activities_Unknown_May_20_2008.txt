Torna Limbu and Abdus SaburKOR 001 / 0508 / OBS 086 Arbitrary arrests / Deportation / Obstacles to the freedom of association Republic of Korea May 20, 2008 The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in South Korea. Brief description of the situation: The Observatory has been informed by the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) about the deportation of Messrs. Torna Limbu and Abdus Sabur, respectively President and Vice-President of the Migrant Trade Union (MTU), an affiliate of the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU). According to the information received, on May 15, 2008, Messrs. Torna Limbu and Abdus Sabur were taken from the Cheongju Foreigners’ Detention Centre and forced to board a plane at Incheon Airport a few hours later, in application of a decision of the Ministry of Justice and Immigration Authorities. The two were deported from South Korea at roughly 9:30 p.m. and arrived in their home countries (Nepal and Bangladesh respectively) the following afternoon after a layover in Bangkok, where they were held in the airport detention centre. The decision took place at the same time as actions protesting the arbitrary arrest of the two MTU leaders (on May 2, 2008) were taking place in Seoul, Cheongju, Daegu and Busan. Furthermore, on May 15, 2008, the South Korean National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) had accepted an MTU appeal to postpone the deportation until the investigation into the human rights violations associated with the arrests of Messrs. Torna Limbu and Abdus Sabur proceeded. The Ministry of Justice was informed orally of this decision, and it is understood that they then rushed to carry out the deportation before they received the formal notice. The Observatory fears that the arbitrary arrest and subsequent deportation of Messrs. Torna Limbu and Abdus Sabur aim at sanctioning their labour right activities and, more largely, MTU activities. Indeed, the Observatory recalls that this is not the first time that South Korea decides to deport MTU leaders: thus, on December 13, 2007, Messrs. Kajiman Khapung, Raju Kumar Gurung and Abul Basher M. Moniruzzaman (Masum), three MTU leaders, were secretly taken out of Cheongju Detention Center, where they had been confined since they were arrested, on November 27, and were transported to Incheon International Airport and deported to their native countries (Nepal and Bangladesh) during the morning hours[1]. Furthermore, the Observatory expresses its deep concern as Messrs. Torna Limbu and Abdus Sabur might face further repression in their home countries. Action requested: Please write to the authorities in South Korea urging them to:   guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of all MTU members as well as all human rights defenders in the country, including trade unionists;  put an immediate end to any obstacles to the activities of the Migrant Workers’ Trade Union;  put an end to all forms of harassment, legal action, and ill-treatment of human rights defenders in South Korea, including trade unionists, as well as any obstacles to freedoms of expression, association and assembly;  ensure the implementation of the provisions of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 9, 1998, in particular article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually or collectively, to promote the protection and fulfilment of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, article 5.b which stipulates that everyone has the right “to form, join and participate in non-governmental organisations, associations or groups, as well as article 12.2, which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually or in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”;  guarantee the respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and other international human rights instruments signed or ratified by the Republic of Korea.
