The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint
programme of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World
Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent intervention on the
following situation in Egypt.
 
Description of the situation:
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the raid of
the headquarters of the Egyptian Centre for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR)
and the arrest and detention of Mr. Moustafa Eissa, Head of ECESR
Documentaries Unit, Mr. Mahmoud Belal, ECESR lawyer, and four ECESR
volunteers - Mr. Hosam Mohamed Nasr, Mr. El Sayed Mahmoud El Sayed, and
Mr. Sherif Ashour and Mr. Mohamed Adel, also a member of the
April 6th Youth Movement, an Egyptian activist group established in Spring 2008
to support the workers in El-Mahalla El-Kubra, an industrial town, who were planning to strike on April 6[1].
 
According to the information received, shortly before midnight on
December 18, 2013, more than 60 heavily armed operatives of Azbakeya and Abdin
police stations and the Homeland Security Agency stormed the headquarters of
the ECESR in Cairo. Without any search or arrest warrants, they brutally
manhandled then arrested the six individuals, ransacked the premises, and
confiscated computer hardware. The six were working on a documentary about the
ongoing strike by the Iron and Steel Workers' Union, in preparation for its
screening at a press conference the following day. 
 
All of them, with the exception of Mr. Mohamed Adel, were released the
following morning and the computers returned to them. They were reportedly
beaten several times during their detention. Mr. Mohamed Adel remains held in
detention at an unknown location. Mr. Adel is
standing trial along with Mr. Ahmed Maher, another leader of the April
6th Youth Movement, and Mr. Ahmed Douma,
on charges of violating the new law restricting protests and
demonstrations.
 
The Observatory denounces a new escalation in the harassment targeting
human rights defenders by the Egyptian authorities and notes that crackdowns of
this kind are not unprecedented but the resumption of a condemnable pattern of
annual year-end raids of the offices of national and international NGOs.
 
Actions requested:
 
Please
write to the authorities of Egypt asking them to:
 
i. Guarantee
in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Mohamed
Adel and all human rights defenders in Egypt;
 
ii. Release Mr. Mohamed Adel and
all human rights defenders currently in detention immediately and unconditionally since their
detention is arbitrary as it seems to only aim at curtailing their human rights
activities;
 
iii. Put an
end to all acts of harassment, including at the judicial level, against Mr.
Mohamed Adel and all human rights defenders in Egypt;
 
iv. Comply with all the provisions
of the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, in particular
with:
-       
its Article 1, which provides that “everyone has the
right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive
for the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at
the national and international levels”;
-       
and its Article 12.2, which provides that “the State
shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent
authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against
any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination,
pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her
legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration” ;
 
v. Ensure in
all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in
accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments
ratified by Egypt.
