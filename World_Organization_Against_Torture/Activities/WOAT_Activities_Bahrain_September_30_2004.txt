New information:   The Observatory has been informed that an order of closure was issued against the Bahrain Center for Human Rights (BCHR) by the Bahraini authorities.  On September 29, 2004, the Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, Dr. Majeed Al-Alawi, issued a press release, in which he declared that he had issued an order to dissolve the BCHR the night before, the order coming into force that same day. The official motive behind this decision is that the BCHR would have violated Law No. 21 of 1989 on Societies, without no other precision.  The BCHR learnt this information through the press and has not been notified of this decision until yet.   The Observatory is extremely concerned by these facts which take the recent acts of repression against the BCHR to a breaking point.    Background information:  The Observatory recalls that BCHR’s executive director, Mr. Abdul-Hadi Al-Khawaja, was arrested on September 26, 2004, after he had criticized the government’s policy during a symposium on economic rights in Bahrain, organized by BCHR on September 24. He was charged for « encouraging hate of the state » and « distributing falseness and rumours » on the basis of articles 165 and 168 of the Bahraini penal code and remanded in custody for 45 days in Howdh Aljaf detention centre.   Following the symposium, a Committee composed of different governmental institutions was also created on September 26, by Dr. Al- Alawi, with the aim of « taking punitive and legal actions against the BCHR » (See press release of the Observatory, dated September 27, 2004).  The Observatory recalls that in October 2003 and May 2004, Dr. Majeed Al Alawi addressed some letters to the BCHR, threatening them to withdraw the Centre’s operating license if they continued their “political activities”, as they would contradict Law No. 21 of 1989 on Societies. Moreover, on June 30, 2004, in an interview with Al Arabiya TV Channel, the Minister openly threatened to shut down the BCHR because of “its political activities.” The Minister called BCHR a political opposition body that had adopted a political agenda. Furthermore, Dr. Alawi criticized the organization’s use of demonstrations as well as article and letter writing to defend and protect human rights in Bahrain (see urgent appeal BHR 001 / 0704 / OBS 054).   The BCHR is an organisation working for the promotion and the defence of all human rights in Bahrain. Its work is more particularly focused on economic and social rights, rights of migrant workers and violence against women migrant workers. During its seminar held on September 24, the BCHR launched a two-year campaign in order to create a partnership among civil society, related institutions and individuals to push for appropriate regulations, policies and reforms to solve the problems linked to poverty in Bahrain.   Action requested:  Please write to the authorities of the Kingdom Bahrain urging them to:   i. Rehabilitate the Bahrain Center for Human Rights (BCHR) and put an immediate end to any obstacles to its activities;  ii. release Mr. Al-Khawaja immediately and unconditionally and drop the charges against him, his detention and the charges against him being arbitrary;  iii. conform with the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders adopted by the UN General Assembly on 9 December 1998, in particular article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually or in association with others, to promote the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels,” and article 5(b), stating that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, at the national and international levels to form, join and participate in non-governmental organizations, associations or groups;”  iv. ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with the Declaration and all other international human rights standards.
