New information: The Observatory has been informed by the Human Rights Information and Documentation Centre (HRIDC) of the new arbitrary detention of Mr. Jaba Jishkariani, Mr. Davit Dalakishvili and Mr. Levan Gogichaishvili, members of the “Egalitarian Institute”, a Georgian NGO which brings together human rights defenders, writers and intellectuals. According to the information received, on June 12, 2007, the police arrested Mr. Jaba Jishkariani, Mr. Davit Dalakishvili and Mr. Levan Gogichaishvili while they were painting their requests on the road in front of the General Prosecution Office regarding the release of Mr. Irakli Batiashvili, the leader of the political party “Tsin Sakartvelo” (“Forward Georgia”), and were taken to Administrative Court. Mr. Irakli Batiashvili had been put in jail in July 2006 for “participation in riot against the State” and was sentenced on May 23, 2007 to seven years of imprisonment under articles 25 and 315 of the Georgian Criminal Code. On the same day, Mr. Jaba Jishkariani, Mr. Davit Dalakishvili and Mr. Levan Gogichaishvili were charged for “violating public order” and “disobedience to the police”, and sentenced to 25 days’ imprisonment according to article 173 of the Georgian Administrative Code. They are currently detained at the pre-trial detention centre of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The Observatory expresses its deepest concern regarding the arbitrary arrest of Mr. Jaba Jishkariani, which only seems to aim at sanctioning his human rights activities, and recalls that he has already been arrested twice in 2006 and in March 2007 (See background information). Background information: Mr. Jishkariani, Mr. Davit Dalakishvili and Mr. Levan Gogichaishvili have been arbitrarily arrested on repeated occasions in 2006[1]. More recently, on March 19, 2007, Mr. Jaba Jishkariani was taken into custody after being sentenced on the same day to 30 days in prison for “disrespect to the court” (Article 208 of the Criminal Code of Georgia), by the Juvenile Court. Mr. Jishkariani was then attending a hearing in the trial against Mr. Giorgi Zerekidze, a juvenile prisoner (14), along with other members of the civil society. In 2006, Mr. Giorgi Zerekidze had been found guilty by the Tbilisi City Court of “attempted murder” and “hooliganism” and sentenced to ten years in prison. On July 18, 2006 the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) had expressed its deep concern following the sentence of Mr. Giorgi Zerekidze and called on Georgia to follow its commitments to ensure the full implementation of international juvenile justice standards under the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which was adopted by Georgia in 1994. On March 19, 2007, the Court of Appeals in Tbilisi  reduced Mr. Giorgi Zerekidze’s sentence to seven years’ imprisonment. Following this decision, Mr. Jishkariani reproached the Court for its lack of independence and said that the sentence was unfair. He also accused the Court Marshals (guardians) of being the “slaves of Mr. Ivane Merabishvili [Minister of Internal Affairs]”. Mr. Jaba Jishkariani was released on April 18, 2007, after spending 30 days in detention at the pre-trial detention centre at the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
