New information:The Observatory has been informed by Human Rights In China (HRIC) about the sentencing of Mr. Chen Guangcheng, a lawyer involved in denouncing the extensive use of violence of the authorities of Linyi, Shangdong province, in the implementation of the birth planning policy, to four years and three months imprisonment.  According to the information received, on August 24, 2006, Mr. Chen Guangcheng was sentenced for “deliberate destruction of property” and “organising a mob to disrupt traffic” by the Linnan County People’s Court. The trial only lasted two hours.  The Observatory is especially concerned that during all the judicial proceedings, Mr. Chen was denied access to the legal team attempting to prepare his defense. Thus, the first instance in his trial took place on August 19, 2006, without the presence of his legal team, all of whom had been either detained by the police or denied access to the court. Indeed, on August 18, 2006, Mr. Xu Zhiyong, one of his defence lawyers, was beaten on August 18, 2006, by five unidentified men and then taken into police custody, only to be released 22 hours later, after Mr. Chen’s trial had already finished. On the same day, police surrounded Mr. Li Jinsong and Mr. Zhang Lihui after dinner and detained them on charges of theft. Both Messrs. Zhang and Li were released, but were then barred from attending the trial.  Two other rights defence lawyers associated with Mr. Chen’s case, Messrs. Yang Zaixin and Zhang Jiankang, were also harassed and forcibly returned home for their involvement in Mr. Chen’s defence.  Consequently, authorities appointed their own public defender, who did not read Mr. Chen’s file and did little to defend him.  Mr. Chen was arrested in March 2006 on  the pretext that he and others activists had obstructed traffic (See background information). He is currently under detention at the Yinan County Detention Centre.  The Observatory expresses its deep concern about this sentencing, as it seems to be directly linked to his activities in favour of the villagers of Linyi, who have been the victims of numerous violations of their rights in relation to the implementation of the birth planning policy. Mr. Chen tried in particular to assist them in bringing legal proceedings against the perpetrators of such violations.  This sentencing contravenes the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its article 6.b, which states that “everyone has the right, to freely publish, impart or disseminate to others views, information and knowledge on all human rights and fundamental freedoms”, and its article 9.3.c, which states that “everyone has the right [...] to offer and provide professionally qualified legal assistance or other relevant advice and assistance in defending human rights and fundamental freedoms”.  The Observatory urges the Chinese authorities to conform with its international human rights obligations, commitments that were reaffirmed by China on the occasion of its election as a member of the new United Nations Human Rights Council.  Background information:Mr. Chen Guangcheng began to investigate into the violence perpetrated on local women and their families in the name of meeting birth planning quotas in his native Linyi City in early 2005. Efforts were made to bring legal action against local authorities for related violations of national law. Information on the extensive violations was also published in international media and on the Internet. Eventually, the State Family Planning Commission conducted its own investigation and admitted publicly that officials had violated the law and that disciplinary action was being taken.  Since August 2005, the authorities have tried to undermine and intimidate Mr. Chen Guangcheng, his family and other villagers who support Mr. Chen’s work, through illegal means such as close surveillance, threats, house arrest and secret detention. On September 6, 2005, Mr. Chen was then placed under “residential surveillance”.  On March 11, 2006, local police arrested and questioned Mr. Chen Guangcheng on  the pretext that he and others activists had obstructed traffic. On the same night, the police assaulted Mr. Chen’s wife. On June 11, 2006, Mr. Cheng’s wife, Mrs. Yuan Weijing, was notified by the Yinan County Public Security Bureau that her husband was charged with “deliberate destruction of property” and “organising a mob to disrupt traffic”.  After his arrest, the police did not notify his family of the reason for his detention, nor did they inform them of his whereabouts. During Mr. Chen’s detention, the police repeatedly summoned and detained many local rights activists and supporters for questioning. On May 8, 2006, when Mr. Chen’s lawyer requested to meet him, the police even denied that they were holding Mr. Chen in detention.  Furthermore, Mr. Xu Zhiyong, one of Mr Chen’s defence lawyers who was supposed to replace lawyer Mr. Li Jingsong, could not get permission from the court, which refused to process the necessary documents. This occurred while Mr. Chen’s lawyers have been under strong pressure from the authorities to drop the case. Actions required:Please write to the Chinese authorities urging them to: i.	Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Chen Guangcheng as well as of his lawyers;  ii.	Ensure that Mr. Chen Guangcheng be immediately released, as his detention is arbitrary;  iii.	Put an end to any kind of reprisals against all human rights defenders in China;  iv.	Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, article 12.2, which states that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”, as well as articles 6.b and 9.3.c above-mentioned;  v.	Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments signed by the People’s Republic of China, in particular the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), that China has publicly declared its intention to ratify.
