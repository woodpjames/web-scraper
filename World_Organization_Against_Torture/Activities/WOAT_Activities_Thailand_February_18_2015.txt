Subject:
Murder of Mr. Chai Bunthonglek in Klong Sai Pattana, Suranthhani Province,
Thailand
 
His
Excellency General Prayuth Cha-o-cha, Prime Minister of Thailand 
 
We
are shocked and deeply saddened to learn about the killing of Mr. Chai
Bunthonglek, a land rights activist and member of the Southern Peasant
Federation of Thailand. Mr. Chai was shot on 11th February 2014 at 6
p.m. by gunmen riding on a motorbike. 
This is the fourth assassination of a land rights activist from Klong
Sai Pattana village, Chaiburi District Surathhani Province in the past five
years. Ms. Montha Chukaew, Ms. Pranee Boonrat and Ms. Somporn Pattaphum were also killed by
gunmen and the perpetrators have not yet been arrested.
The
community members of Khong Sai Pattana continue to be threatened with forced
evictions and violence by armed personnel closely linked the Jew Kung Juy
Development Company, despite the fact that they won court cases in the Court of
First Instance and the Court of Appeals against the Company.  Although these victories affirm the legal
rights of community members to their lands, the company continues to occupy
these lands while the case is pending in the High Court.
Since
the declaration of martial law in May, 2014, we have witnessed an escalation
and expansion of human rights violations in Thailand.  In both, rural and urban areas, local
communities are becoming economically and politically marginalized and
vulnerable because of land grabbing, forced evictions and restricted access to
forest areas, which threaten their fundamental rights to life and dignity. 
We
fully extend our solidarity and support to the local communities defending their
rights and especially to the Southern Peasant’s Federation of Thailand. We urge
the Government of Thailand to immediately take the following actions:
1.      
Investigate,
identify and arrest the gunmen and their accomplices responsible for the
assassination of Mr. Chai, Ms. Montha Chukaew, Ms.
Pranee Boonrat and Ms. Somporn
Pattaphum in
Chaiburi District, Suratthani Province and in Khaopranom District, Krabi
Province. 
2.      
Ensure
that the Agricultural Land Reform Office transfers the disputed lands to the
community members of Khlong Sai Pattana in the form of a community land deed as
ordered by the Court of Appeals. 
3.       Ensure that the families of the deceased
receive the reparations and compensations enshrined in Thai law.
We also urge the
Government of Thailand to initiate and implement structural remedies to ensure
peace and democracy in the country without delay. A crucial component to this
is creating a climate of transparency and justice by repealing martial law and
returning political power to a civilian government. 
We are hopeful that
the government of Thailand will take immediate action to bring justice and
peace in both the short and long term for the collective benefit of its
citizens and nation. 
Yours sincerely, 
Individual
