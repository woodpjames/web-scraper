The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in Sudan.
 
Description of the situation:
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the arrest and incommunicado detention of Dr. Abdelbasit Murgany, a prominent human rights defender, in Khartoum.
According to the information received, Dr. Abdelbasit Murgany is currently detained incommunicado without charges by the Sudanese Security Services in an undisclosed location. Dr.  Abdelbasit Murgany suffers from hypertension and other cardiac problems that require consistent medical care. 
 
Given that he is reportedly detained incommunicado, the Observatory fears that Dr. Abdelbasit Murgany might be subjected to acts of torture or ill-treatment during his detention. 
The Observatory denounces the arrest and incommunicadodetention of Dr. Abdelbasit Murgany and expresses its deep concern about his physical and psychological integrity. The Observatory calls on the Sudanese government to immediately disclose where Dr. Abdelbasit Murgany is being held; to ensure him access to adequate healthcare and to a lawyer of his choice; to grant his family access to see him, and to order his immediate release in the absence of valid legal charges that are consistent with international law and standards, or, if such charges exist, bring him promptly before an impartial, independent and competent tribunal and guarantee his procedural rights.
 
Actions requested:
 
The Observatory urges the authorities of Sudan to: 
 
i.      Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Dr. Abdelbasit Murgany, as well as of all human rights defenders in Sudan;
 
ii.     Grant Dr. Abdelbasit Murgany immediate and unconditional access to a lawyer of his choice and to his family, as well as guarantee that he receives adequate medical care, in accordance, interalia, with the UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners;
 
iii.    Order his immediate release in the absence of valid legal charges that are consistent with international law and standards, or, if such charges exist, bring him before an impartial, independent and competent tribunal and guarantee his procedural rights at all times;
 
iv.    Conform in any circumstances with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, in particular its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually or in association with others, to promote the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, its Article 5 (b) which establishes that “for the purpose of promoting and protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms, everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, at the national and international levels to form, join and participate in non-governmental organizations, associations or groups”, and its article 12.2 which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”; 
 
v.     Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by Sudan, such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
