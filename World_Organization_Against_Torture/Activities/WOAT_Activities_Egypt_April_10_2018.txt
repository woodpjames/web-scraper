The Observatory for the
Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a partnership of World Organisation
Against Torture (OMCT) and FIDH, requests your urgent intervention in the
following situation in Egypt.
Description of the situation:
The
Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the ongoing arbitrary
detention of Mr. Omar Mohamed Ali, a
human rights defender and independent journalist.
 
According
to the information received, on March 26, 2018, the Supreme Military Court of
Appeals rejected Mr. Ibrahim Omar’s appeal and confirmed his sentence to 25
years in prison, under charges of “joining a terrorist group”
and “leaking false military information”.
 
Mr. Omar Mohamed Ali was arrested on June 1, 2015, in front of the Nile City
boat in Zamalek, Cairo by three men in civil clothing, and was held
incommunicado for 16 days in the State security building of Lazoughly
and in a military intelligence building in Cairo. During this time, he was subjected
to acts torture in order to force him to memorize two papers which were then
recorded in a fake confession video. After having signed the investigation
papers while blindfolded and in absence of his lawyer, Mr. Omar Mohamed Ali was
sent to Tora prison where he was detained for almost a year without any charge
and where he remains detained to date. 
 
On May 29,
2016, Mr. Omar Mohamed Ali was sentenced to 25 years in prison by the West Cairo
Military Court following an unfair trial based on the confessions obtained
under torture. 
 
In
November 2017, the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (WGAD) published an opinion[1]
in which it considered Mr. Omar Mohamed Ali’s detention to be arbitrary and
urging his immediate release and his right to compensation. The opinion asserted
that Mr. Omar Mohamed Ali and other 17 individuals were “charged with
‘belonging to a banned group’ after being severely tortured in order to get
them to sign statements incriminating themselves”, in clear breach of articles
3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)
and of articles 7, 9, 10, 14, 16, 19, 21 and 22 of the International Covenant
on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).
 
The
Observatory strongly condemns the arbitrary detention of Mr. Omar Mohamed Ali,
which is in breach of international law and represents a reprisal against his
peaceful and legitimate human rights activities. Moreover, the Observatory
expresses its utmost concerns at the worsening health condition of Mr. Omar
Mohamed Ali, who is held in an overcrowded and unhygienic cell and has no
access to medical care.  
 
The
Observatory urges the Egyptian authorities to fully implement the WGAD opinion
by immediately and unconditionally releasing Mr. Omar Mohamed Ali and to
conduct an immediate, thorough, impartial and transparent investigation into
the allegations of torture of Mr. Omar Mohamed Ali in order to identify all
those responsible, bring them before an independent tribunal, and sanction them
as provided by the law. In the meantime, the Observatory calls upon the
Egyptian authorities to ensure the physical and psychological integrity of Mr.
Omar Mohamed Ali and his right to fair trial.
