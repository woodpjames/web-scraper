PremathilakaCase LKA 280105 Arbitrary arrest / Torture  The International Secretariat of OMCT requests your URGENT intervention in the following situation in Sri Lanka.   Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Asian Human Rights Commission (AHRC), a member of the OMCT network, of the arbitrary arrest and torture of Mr. D.G. Premathilaka by Katugastota police for the second time.  According to information received, Mr. Premathilaka was arrested and severely tortured by twelve Katugastota policemen, including the officer-in-charge on 23 January 2005.  The police forcibly entered his house and took him to the police station. His wife visited him the next day and noticed that his sarong was wet with blood. Premathilaka complained that he had been brutally tortured.   On 25th January, Mr. Premathilaka appeared before Kandy Magistrate, he was appointed a lawyer by Katugastota police officers, and was charged with selling illicit liquor. He was not granted bail and is remanded until 8 February 2005.   Previously, on 8 and 9 January 2004, Mr. D.G. Premathilaka was arrested and tortured by Katugastota police, for giving up his illicit liquor business. It is reported that the illicit liquor business is often beneficial to the police, as it can only be carried out by paying bribes to the police. Subsequently, he filed complaints against the alleged perpetrators and has since been threatened and pressured to withdraw his compliant by the police. On 16 November 2004, D.G. Prmathilaka was threatened by Mr. Aranpath and several officers from the Katugastota Police who allegedly said, “If you do withdraw the file, you will be taken good care of by the police”. The police further told him that a warrant had been issued for his arrest and he should accompany them to the police station, but failed to produce a warrant against him. At the time, D.G. Premathilaka refused to accompany them without seeing a warrant.   The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned for the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. D.G. Premathilaka and calls on the Sri Lankan government abide by the international legal obligations it has subscribed to, namely by taking genuine steps to implement the Convention Against Torture (CAT), which it has ratified and therefore accepted as domestic law.   Action requested Please write to the authorities in Sri Lanka urging them to:   i. Take all necessary measures to guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. D.G. Premathilaka;  ii. Order his immediate release in the absence of valid legal charges, and if such charges exist, to ensure that he is given a prompt and fair trial, in which his procedural rights are guaranteed at all times;  iii. Immediately order a thorough and impartial investigation into this case of torture, in order to identify all those responsible, bring them to trial and apply the penal and/or administrative sanctions as provided by law;   iv. Guarantee that adequate reparation and medical care is provided to the victim;  v. Guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
