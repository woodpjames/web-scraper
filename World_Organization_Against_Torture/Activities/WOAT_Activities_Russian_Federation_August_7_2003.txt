Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by a Kyrgyz Committee for Human Rights, a member of the OMCT network, and the International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights that the exiled Turkmen opposition leader Mr. Avdy Kuliev has been brutally beaten in Moscow in the Russian Federation.  According to the information received, Mr. Avdy Kuliev, a former Foreign Minister of Turkmenistan who, while in exile in Moscow founded the United Democratic Opposition of Turkmenistan, was brutally beaten near his home on the outskirts of Moscow, on the afternoon of August 6th, 2003 by a young man who waited for him there.  Kuliev, who is 67 years old, told the International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights that he believes the attack was ordered by agents of the Turkmen government. Three months ago, Kuliev was publicly threatened by President Niazov who said "Everybody is sick of Kuliev, it is time to send him to another world."  Kuliev reportedly added that he preferred not to go to a hospital for fear of further attacks.  The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned for Mr. Avdy Kuliev's physical and psychological integrity, notably because of the death threats that have been proffered against him by the Turkmen President. OMCT therefore calls upon the Russian authorities to guarantee his integrity at all times, to launch an investigation into this attack, in order to identify the perpetrators of these acts, and to bring them to justice.  Action requested  Please write to the authorities in the Russian Federation urging them to:  i.	take all necessary measures to guarantee Mr. Avdy Kuliev's physical and psychological integrity; ii.	intervene with the proper authorities to ensure that he is provided with adequate medical assistance as a matter of urgency; iii.	guarantee an immediate investigation into the circumstances of these events, in order to identify those responsible, bring them before a competent and impartial tribunal and apply the penal and/or administrative sanctions provided by law; iv.	guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
