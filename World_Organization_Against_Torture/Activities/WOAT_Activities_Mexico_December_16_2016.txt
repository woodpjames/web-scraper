Geneva,
Paris, Oaxaca, Dublin, Mexico City, December 16, 2016 – The report (available in English and Spanish) prepared
jointly by 11 Mexican and international civil society organisations analyses
the cases of five human rights defenders whose detentions have been declared
arbitrary by the UN. The organisations demand immediate compliance with the UN
Opinions and report that the detentions, torture and other human rights
violations suffered by the defenders show a wider pattern of criminalisation of
social protest in Mexico, which seeks to hindrance the defense of human rights.
                     
Damián Gallardo Martínez and Enrique Guerrero Aviña have been
arbitrarily detained for 1307 days; Librado
Baños Rodríguez has been arbitrarily detained for 1208 days; Pedro Canché Herrera was arbitrarily
detained for 638 days before his release on 29 May, 2015; and Nestora Salgado was arbitrarily
detained for 941 days before her release on 18 March, 2016. These two are still
waiting for full redress for the damages suffered and Nestora Salgado continues
to be harassed and criminalised.
 
They are
all human rights defenders and their detentions are linked to their legitimate
activities for the defense of human rights. They were all illegally arrested
with no arrest warrant, imprisoned due to crimes that they had not committed,
and they suffered the same pattern, including several forms of torture and
ill-treatment at the time of arrest and within the detention facilities,
isolation, forced disappearance before they were presented to the court,
threats, detention, smear campaigns, lack of due diligence and lack of
independence of the judiciary when declaring said detentions legal. 
 
The UN
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention has issued opinions stating that the five
defenders are victims of arbitrary detention. The five opinions were issued
within just over one year, between August 2014 and December 2015, an
unprecedented time frame since it was the first time that the Working Group
issued so many opinions on one country in such a short period. 
 
Two
years and five months after the first opinion was issued, three human rights
defenders—Damián Gallardo, Enrique Guerrero and Librado Baños—remain under
arbitrary detention and face constant and repeated human rights violations,
including torture and ill-treatment, which have caused irreparable health
damages. 
 
We must
mention the fact that these five iconic cases only represent a small fraction
of the total amount of unpunished arbitrary detentions that take place in the
country, but they are proof of the existence of a worrying pattern of
criminalisation of social protest in Mexico. This pattern of arbitrary
detention of human rights defenders seems to reflect the desire to hindrance
their work defending the human rights to which all Mexicans are entitled.
 
“We
demand the immediate release of Damián Gallardo, Enrique Guerrero and Librado
Baños, as well as the end of criminalisation and full redress for the five
human rights defenders due to the many human rights violations suffered. The
fact that Mexico has yet to comply with the UN’s opinions questions the
country's commitment with the international community regarding human rights
and shows the urgent need for structural reforms to prevent similar cases in
the future”, stated the organisations.
 
This
report is part of a national and international joint campaign, in which
framework the participating organisations have already arranged meetings with
international institutions such as the European Union and its Member States in
Brussels, the United Nations and Swiss authorities in Geneva, as well as with
national and international authorities in Mexico City and in Oaxaca. The case
in Oaxaca is remarkable due to the fact that two of the defenders that remain
detained, Damián Gallardo and Librado Baños, are from this state and civil
society organisations have documented 77 cases of political prisoners in
Oaxaca.
