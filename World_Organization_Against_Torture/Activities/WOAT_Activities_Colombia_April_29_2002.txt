Brief description of the situation:  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed of forced disappearances which occurred in the Departments of Antioquia, Boyacá, Santander and Cundinamarca.   According to information received from the  Asociación de familiares de Detenidos Desaparecidos de Colombia (ASFADDES), in the past few days the following cases of forced disappearances have been reported in Colombia :  -	Misael Durango Benítez  and  Hiber Padierna, banana freighters who had been working for a period of four months,  disappeared  since the 20 December of the year 2000 when they left the city of  Chigorodó directed to Medellín, Antioquia, in a truck with plates VSC 809, belonging to Mr. Durango Benítez.  Misael Durango Benítez  and  Hiber Padierna never reached Medellín and as of this moment there has been no information on their whereabouts.  It is important to recall that in 1998, the Benítez family was displaced from the municipality of Dabeiba to Urabá Antioqueño, and some time later Mrs.  María Iris Benitez Guzmán, Mr Misael Durango Benítez’s aunt was found murdered.  -	César Tulio Gutiérrez Daza, of 30 years of age from Almeida, Boyacá, construction worker, is reported missing  since the 1st of February 2002 when he left his home in Vereda “El Yabir” for work at the Vereda “El Rosal” in the municipality of Almeida, on a borrowed motorcycle, which he returned to his boss the same day. He left work at 6 p.m. in the company of Anderson Calderón Daza and Rodrigo Peralta.  César Tulio Gutiérrez Daza took a different way while Anderson Calderón Daza  and  Rodrigo Peralta arrived at San Judas where they parted,  César Tulio Gutiérrez Daza headed home and this was his last sighting. According to his mother,  Bertha Daza, he had never expressed fearing for his life.  Prior to this, in events of the 19th of January 2001 in the municipality of Almeida, César Tulio Gutiérrez Daza, was involved in a penal investigation, when  Vaca Gutiérrez family  accused him of being responsible for the death of  Gumercinda Vaca.   -	Fredy Enrique Durán Rangel, has been reported missing since the 12th of  April 2002, when he left home in the Urbanización los Pinos de Bucaramanga at 9 a.m. directed towards the townhall of Rionegro, Santander, in his red van UV model 86 with plates IWF-258, to buy leather skins, for the work he had been doing for some time. Freddy  Enrique Durán Rangel phoned his wife  Clara Blanco from Rionegro and told her he was fine and that he would be home at  3 p.m. that same day, but nothing has been heard of him since.  Later, on Saturday the 20th of April 2002, an unknown man paid a visit to Freddy Enrique Durán Rangel’s house, to ask if it was for sale, and if she had sent the advert for the sale, when she told she hadn’t he said that he had been sent by an estate agent to see the house.Subsequently, on Monday the  22nd of April 2002, at 11:00 a.m.a woman came to the same house asking whether it was for sale and, following  Durán Rangel’s father, Carlos Durán’s negative answer, she looked all around the house’s surroundings for about 4 hours and was joined by two people in a black van LUV with plates BUY-791;  since the house is near a military command it was alerted and soldiers detained the van but having no reason to keep the people in custody they were released.    -	Alvaro Sánchez Rojas, of 55 years of age, married, from Cabrera, Cundinamarca, was reported missing since the 22nd of April  2002 when he left his home located at 59 A No 80 c– 10 of the Bosa neighbohood in the city of Bogotá  on his way to the municipality of Nimaima to the rural community of el Cerro, in a black, Samurai vehicle with plates MQA 701; he was going to this destination to pick up material for his trade as a salesman in Corabastos providing objects for supermarkets. On his way home at about 4.30 p.m. that same day he was accosted by unknown men who took him with them, where to we know not. His  family are very worried since Alvaro Sánchez Rojas suffers from diabetes and from Pancreatitis, as well as having had two strokes. Subsequent to these events, on April 24th information had been given concerning the fact that certain land workers had seen Alvaro Sanchez Rojas seemingly in the hands of members of paramilitary groups in a place called El Cruce de las Mercedes, located between the municipalities of Nimaima and Nocaima, Cundinamarca inhabited by several families and where the Army often is encamped.  It is important to remember that in this region fighting between outlawed armed groups and the  Batallón Rincón Quiñónez of the Army had taken place.   The Secretariat of OMCT reiterates that forced disappearances are considered a crime against humanity and condemns these acts of violence, persecution against civilian populations and the apparent impunity of the authors and the lack of of means put forward by municipal, governmental and national authorities towards preventing these acts.
