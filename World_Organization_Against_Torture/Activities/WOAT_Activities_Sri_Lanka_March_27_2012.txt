The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint 
programme of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and the International 
Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), requests your urgent intervention in the 
following situation in Sri Lanka.
 
Brief description of the information:
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the smear 
campaign in the State media against Ms. Sunila Abeysekara, Ms. Nimalka Fernando, Dr. Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu 
and Mr. Sunanda Deshapriya, human rights defenders who are actively engaged 
in the fight against impunity for past and present human rights violations in 
Sri Lanka[1], following their 
participation in the 19th session of the United Nations Human Rights Council in 
Geneva, Switzerland.
 
According to the information received, in the past weeks, a smear 
campaign has intensified in the State media in Sri Lanka against Ms. Sunila 
Abeysekara, Ms. Nimalka Fernando, Dr. Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu and Mr. Sunanda 
Deshapriya, at a time when a resolution on “promoting reconciliation and 
accountability in Sri Lanka” was tabled at the UN Human Rights 
Council.
 
In particular, Rupavahini, the State television channel, the 
Independent Television Network (ITN) and the Lake House group of 
newspapers, all of which are under direct State control, used the photographs of 
the defenders, portrayed them as supporters of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil 
Elam (LTTE) and accused them of receiving money from the Tamil Diaspora and of working against the 
interests of the country to obtain “dollars”[2]. These harassments have made them vulnerable to physical attacks.
 
Yet, what appears as the Government of Sri Lanka’s strategy to resist 
the resolution on Sri Lanka was rather counter-productive, as the resolution was 
finally adopted on March 22, 2012, after much focus was drawn on the attacks and 
acts of intimidation of Sri Lankan human rights defenders. In particular, on 
March 23, 2012, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights expressed her concern 
about the “unprecedented and totally unacceptable level of threats, harassment 
and intimidation directed at Sri Lankan activists who had travelled to Geneva to 
engage in the debate, including by members of the 71-member official Sri Lankan 
government delegation”, and “warn[ed] that there must be no reprisals against 
Sri Lankan human rights defenders in the aftermath of yesterday's adoption by 
the Human Rights Council of a resolution on Sri Lanka”[3].
 
Furthermore, on March 23, 2012, speaking at a protest against the UN 
resolution on Sri Lanka, Minister of Public Relations Mervyn Silva named Dr. 
Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu, Dr. Nimalka Fernando and Mr. Sunanda Deshapriya as 
“traitors” to their country, and threatened to “break their limbs” in public if 
they were to dare to set foot in the country. Similarly, Media Minister Keheliya 
Rambukwella reportedly said to the State run Dinamina newspaper that 
human rights defenders present in Geneva “betrayed the motherland for dollars 
after enjoying free education and health services,” and that “they are worse 
than the foreign elements”, adding that “there is no need whatsoever to fall 
down on knees before the international community”[4].

 
The Observatory expresses its deepest concern about the threats and 
smear campaign against Ms. Sunila Abeysekara, Ms. Nimalka Fernando, Dr. Paikiasothy 
Saravanamuttu and Mr. Sunanda Deshapriya, which seem to merely aim at 
undermining the legitimacy of their peaceful activities, and calls upon the 
authorities of Sri Lanka to guarantee in all circumstances their physical and psychological 
integrity.
