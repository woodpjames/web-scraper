The Observatory for the Protection of
Human Rights Defenders, a partnership of the World Organisation Against Torture
(OMCT) and FIDH, requests your URGENT intervention in the following situation
in Malaysia.
 
Brief description of the information:
 
The Observatory has been informed with
great concern about the arbitrary arrest in Kuala Lumpur of Mr. Adilur Rahman
Khan, Secretary of the human rights non-governmental
organisation Odhikar, in
Bangladesh[1],
also a member of OMCT General Assembly and FIDH Vice-President.
 
According to the information received, on July 20, 2017, at about 4.00 am, Mr. Adilur Rahman Khan was detained by immigration officers upon
his arrival at Kuala Lumpur International Airport. No reason was given for his
detention. 
 
Mr. Rahman Khan was travelling to Malaysia to attend the National
Conference on Death Penalty organised by the Anti-Death Penalty Asia Network
(ADPAN) from July 21 to 22, 2017 in Kuala Lumpur.
 
The Observatory strongly condemns Mr. Adilur Rahman Khan’s
arbitrary arrest, and calls upon the Malaysian authorities to release him
immediately and unconditionally, as well as to guarantee in all circumstances
his physical and psychological integrity.
 
Actions requested:
 
Please write to the authorities in Malaysia,
urging them to:
 
i.
Guarantee, in all circumstances, the physical and psychological integrity of
Mr. Adilur Rahman Khan, as well as of all human rights defenders in Malaysia;
 
ii. Release Mr. Adilur Rahman Khan immediately and
unconditionally as his detention is arbitrary since it only aims at
sanctioning his human rights activities;
 
iii.
Put an end to any kind of harassment - including at the judicial level -
against Mr. Adilur Rahman Khan as well as all human rights defenders in Malaysia;
 
iv.
Ensure in all circumstances that all human rights defenders in Malaysia are
able to carry out their legitimate activities without any hindrance and fear of
reprisals;
 
v.
Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders,
adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998,
especially its Articles 1 and
12.2;
 
vi.
Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms
in accordance with international human rights standards and international
instruments ratified by Malaysia.
