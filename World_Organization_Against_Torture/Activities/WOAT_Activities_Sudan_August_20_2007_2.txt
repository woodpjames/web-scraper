New information: The Observatory has been informed by the Sudan Organisation Against Torture (SOAT) about the release of Mr. Osman Ibrahim, spokesperson of the Farraig Committee Against the Building of the Kajbar Dam (CABKD), a group campaigning on behalf of the communities which are at risk of being affected by this dam, as well as of Messrs. Alam Aldeen Abd Alghni, Emad Merghni Seed Ahmed, Abd Allah Abd Alghume, lawyers, and Mr. Mugahid  Mohamed Abdalla, a journalist. According to the information received, on August 19, 2007, at 3 pm (local time), Messrs. Osman Ibrahim, Alam Aldeen Abd Alghni, Emad Merghni Seed Ahmed, Abd Allah Abd Alghume, and Mugahid  Mohamed Abdalla were released from Dabak prison, in the North of Khartoum. They had all been arrested in connection with the protests on June 13, 2007 against government plans to build the Kajbar Dam in Sudan’s Northern State (See background information). No reason for their detention was given and their release was conditional on signing a document whereby they agreed to abide by refraining from “engaging in further political activities”. The Observatory welcomes the release of Messrs. Osman Ibrahim, Alam Aldeen Abd Alghni, Emad Merghni Seed Ahmed, Abd Allah Abd Alghume, and Mugahid  Mohamed Abdalla and wishes to thank all the persons, organisations, and institutions that intervened in their favour. Nevertheless, the Observatory deplores the conditions imposed by the authorities in exchange of their release and considers them as a violation of Article 1 of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels” and of its Article 6.b, which reads that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others [...] freely to publish, impart or disseminate to others views, information and knowledge on all human rights and fundamental freedoms”. Background information: On July 20, 2007, Mr. Osman Ibrahim was arrested by police officers early in the morning while at his home in Farraig village, Halfa municipality (Northern Sudan), without a warrant and without being informed of where he was being taken. His whereabouts remained unknown until August 6, 2007, when the Observatory was informed that he was detained at the Dabak prison, in the North of Karthoum. Mr. Osman Ibrahim’s arrest followed incidents reported on June 13, 2007, when Sudanese security forces killed and injured civilians in the Farraig village by shooting at them during a peaceful demonstration against the construction of the Kajbar dam in the area. On that occasion, several individuals were arrested and detained in Dongola, the capital of the northern State, and in Khartoum[1]. Following these events, Messrs. Alam Aldeen Abd Alghni, Emad Merghni Seed Ahmed, Abd Allah Abd Alghume, all lawyers who were attending the protest to look into any legal issue related to the event, and Mr. Mugahid  Mohamed Abdalla, a journalist who covered the event, were also arrested. They were also detained at the Dabak prison. The above-mentioned defenders were all refused visits from their families and lawyers, except Mr. Alam Aldeen Abd Alghni, who was allowed a 15 minutes visit by relatives. Finally, the Observatory was informed that the following members of the CABKD might be at risk of being arrested as security personnel have been asking and inquiring about them since June, as they also did in the case of Mr. Osman Ibrahim: Mr. Adham Nasor, representative of the Khartoum section of the CABKD and coordinator of the international committee of the organisation, Dr. Abdul Halim Sabar, Mr. Abdul Fatah Zaidan, Mr. Abdul Hakam Nasor, Dr. Ahmed Abdalla Khidir, Dr. Abdel Gadir Shallabi, working for the local developmental NGO “Nabata”, and Mr. Ezzendeen Idris, seventy year-old teacher from the Farraig section of the CABKD.
