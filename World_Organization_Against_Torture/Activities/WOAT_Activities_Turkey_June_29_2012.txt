TURKEY: 
Confirmed Pre-trial 
Detention for Human Rights Defender Osman Işçi 

and 27 trade union members
 
29 
June 2012
 
The 
undersigned organisations express their deepest concern regarding the decision 
of the court to place in detention 28 trade union members, including Osman 
Işçi.
 
On June 28-29, 
2012, the Ankara Heavy Penal Court No. 12 decided to place Mr. Osman Işçi, member of the Human Rights Association 
(İHD), EMHRN Executive Committee member and a member of Eğitim Sen, the 
Education and Science Workers Trade Union affiliated to the Confederation of 
Public Workers’ Trade Unions (KESK), on 
pre-trial detention. 27 other trade union members[1] were also 
placed on pre-trial detention under charges of “being a member of an illegal 
organisation” under Article 314 of Turkish Penal Code (TPC). 25 have been 
provisionally released pending the outcome of the investigation. 

 
All were 
detained at the beginning of this week by police forces in the framework of an anti-terrorist operation intended to 
dismantle the alleged terrorist network - the Kurdish Communities Union (KCK) - 
an organisation said by the authorities to be the “urban branch” of the armed 
Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). Since 2009, several operations of this kind were 
launched targeting mostly peaceful Kurdish and pro-Kurdish activists. This last 
operation targeted members of 
trade unions affiliated to the KESK: the Egitim-Sen, SES (The Trade Union of 
Public Employees in Health and Social Services), BTS (United Trade Union of 
Transport Employees) in Ankara, Diyarbakır, İstanbul, Ağrı, Bitlis, Siirt, 
Adana, Eskişehir Provinces. 
 
All will remain in 
detention at least until the closing of the investigation, which could take 
place in up to 6 or 12 months. The Criminal Proceedings Law allows for up to 10 
years of pre-trial detention, measure for which Turkey has been condemned by the 
European Court of Human Rights several times. This  law has been particularly used against 
human rights defenders over the past years, entailing the application of a set 
of rules less protective of the defense rights: excessive length of pre-trial 
detention, obstacles to the access of evidence against defendants making the 
appeal of detention extremely difficult, excessive length of criminal 
proceedings, impossibility to counter examine some witnesses, etc. 

 
Our organisations are 
deeply concerned that the vague definition of terrorism and 
its interpretation by the courts has made it possible for prosecutors and judges 
to consider that the mere critic of the authorities for their human rights 
record may in itself be construed as a form of support to terrorist groups or 
evidence of membership in terrorist groups. 
 
Therefore, our organisations call 
for the immediate and unconditional release of Osman Işçi and the 27 other trade 
union members since their detention is arbitrary as it seems to merely punish 
their human rights activities. We also request the authorities to guarantee 
immediate and full access to the criminal file by the defense 
lawyers.
 
More generally, we urge 
the authorities of Turkey to put an end to the judicial harassment faced by 
numerous human rights defenders in the country and to act in conformity with the 
UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders adopted by the General Assembly on 
December 9, 1998.
