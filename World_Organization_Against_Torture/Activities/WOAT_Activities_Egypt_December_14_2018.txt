Mr. Mohamed Ramadan denied the charges and his lawyer reminded that Egyptian law does not criminalise the possession of a yellow vest.  Mr. Mohamed Ramadan was arrested on December 10, 2018, by plainclothes security officers while coming back to his home in Alexandria after he attended an investigation with one of his clients. He was taken to the National Security Agency headquarter in Alexandria and his fate and whereabouts remained unknown to his family and lawyers until he appeared before the Montazah prosecution on December 11, 2018.  The Observatory recalls that Mr. Ramadan has been subject to harassment on previous occasions. In June 2017, he was fined 50,000 EGP (around 2,455 Euros) on charges of “conspiring to protest and disrupt a public throughway” following his participation in peaceful protests, but appealed against the decision and  was later acquitted of these charges at the end of 2017.  On April 12, 2017, Mr. Ramadan was sentenced in absentia - as he was in hospital at that time and the court refused to reschedule the hearing -to ten years in prison followed by five years of house arrest, and banned from using Internet and social media for five years, on charges of “insulting the president”, “misusing social media”, and “inciting violence” under the 2015 anti-terrorism law[1]for his alleged involvement in protests over Egypt’s transfer of Tiran and Sanafir islands to Saudi Arabia. A retrial was requested by Mr. Ramadan’s lawyer and ordered in July 2017 but was suspended in June 2018 and will remain so pending a  Supreme Constitutional Court’s decision on the anti-terrorism law, under which articles Mr. Ramadan was charged.  Mr. Mohamed Ramadan’s arrest comes as the Egyptian authorities have reportedly set restrictions to sales of yellow vests fearing opponents may use them in anti-government protests around the January anniversary of the 2011 uprising that toppled former autocrat Hosni Mubarak.  The Observatory strongly condemns the arbitrary detention and judicial harassment of Mr. Mohamed Ramadan, which seems only aimed at punishing him for his legitimate human rights activities and for exercising his freedoms of expression, and calls on the Egyptian authorities to end any act of harassment, including at the judicial level, against him and all human rights defenders in the country.  Actions requested: Please write to the authorities of Egypt asking them to: i. Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Mohamed Ramadan and all human rights defenders in Egypt; ii. End any act of harassment, against Mr. Mohamed Ramadan and ensure all the human rights defenders are able to carry out their legitimate activities without any hindrance or fear of reprisals; iii. Comply with all the provisions of the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 9, 1998, in particular with its Articles 1, and 12; iv. Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by Egypt. Addresses: ·       President of the Arab Republic of Egypt, H.E.
