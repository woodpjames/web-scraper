New information The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Sudan Organisation Against Torture (SOAT), a member of the SOS-Torture network, of the release from Dabak prison in the North of Khartoum of Mr. Alam Aldeen Abd Alghni (Lawyer, arrested on 13 June 2007), Mr. Emad Merghni Seed Ahmed (Lawyer, arrested on 13 June 2007 ), Mr. Abd Allah Abd Alghume (Lawyer, arrested on 13 June 2007), and Mr. Osman Shammat (Driver, arrested on 13 June 2007) on 19 August 2007 at 3 pm. They had all been arrested following the protests on 13 June 2007 against government plans to build the Kajabar Dam in Sudan's Northern State. According to the information, no reason for their detention was given and their release was allegedly conditional on signing a document whereby they agreed to abide by certain conditions, namely to refrain from engaging in further political activities. However, Dr. Mohammed Julal Hashim (University Lecturer, arrested on 15 June 2007) remains detained in Dabak prison, North of Khartoum. The International Secretariat of OMCT welcomes the release of the four persons mentioned above although it deplores the conditions of their release. Furthermore, OMCT expresses its deep concern regarding the extended detention of Dr. Mohammed Julal Hashim. OMCT urges the Sudanese authorities to guarantee his physical and psychological integrity at all times and calls on his immediate release in the absence of valid legal charges, and if such charges exist, ensure that he is given a prompt and fair trial, in which his procedural rights are guaranteed at all times.
