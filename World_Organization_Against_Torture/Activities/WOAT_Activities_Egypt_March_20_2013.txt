The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in Egypt.
 
Brief description of the situation:
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the appeal lodged against the sentencing to two years' imprisonment of Mr. Hassan Mustafa, an activist defending the rights of detainees in Alexandria, and working on issues such as economic rights and police violence.
 
According to the information received, on March 12, 2013, Mr. Mustafa was sentenced to two years' imprisonment by the Mansheya Misdemeanour Court, for allegedly attacking a member of the Prosecution Office. 
 
On the same day, his lawyer appealed the sentencing, and the hearing in appeal is scheduled for April 13, 2013. Mr. Mustafa is currently detained in Al Gharbaneyat prison. 
 
Mr. Mustafa had been arrested on January 21, 2013, as he was in the premises of the Prosecution Office to request information on the situation and whereabouts of demonstrators arrested two days earlier. 
 
During the hearing on March 12, 2013, the Court reportedly heard only two defence testimonies out of 15. Mr. Mustafa's lawyer reported in particular that he had witnessed the arrest of his client and denied the fact that the latter had attacked a member of the Prosecution Office on that occasion.
 
The Observatory expresses its deep concern about the sentencing of Mr. Hassan Mustafa, which it considers as an attempt to prevent his legitimate and peaceful human rights activities.
 
The Observatory calls for the full respect of fair trial standards throughout the hearings in appeal, and more generally for the respect of all the provisions of the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted on December 9, 1998 by the United Nations General Assembly.
 
Actions requested:
 
Please write to the authorities of Egypt asking them to:
 
i.       Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Hassan Mustafa and all human rights defenders in Egypt;
 
ii.      Release Mr. Hassan Mustafa immediately and unconditionally since his detention is arbitrary as it seems to only aim at sanctioning his human rights activities;
 
iii.     Put an end to all acts of harassment, including at the judicial level, against Mr. Hassan Mustafa and all human rights defenders in Egypt;
 
iv.    Comply with all the provisions of the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, in particular with:
-       its Article 1, which provides that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”;
-       its Article 6 (a) and (b), which provides that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others: To know, seek, obtain, receive and hold information about all human rights and fundamental freedoms, including having access to information as to how those rights and freedoms are given effect in domestic legislative, judicial or administrative systems; and a provided for in human rights and other applicable international instruments, freely to publish, impart or disseminate to others views, information and knowledge on all human rights and fundamental freedoms”;
 
v.      Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by Egypt.
