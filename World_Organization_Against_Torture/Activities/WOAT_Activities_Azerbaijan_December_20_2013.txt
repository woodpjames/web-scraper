The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of
the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation
Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent intervention in the following
situation in Azerbaijan.
 
Brief description of the situation
 
The
Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the arbitrary arrest and
detention of Mr. Anar Mammadli, Chairman of the Azerbaijani Election Monitoring and Democracy Studies
Centre (EMDS), a not-for-profit organisation that carries out independent
election monitoring since 2001 and documented electoral irregularities during
the presidential elections of October 9, 2013. 
 
According to the information received, on
December 16, 2013, Mr. Anar Mammadli, Mr. Bashir
Suleimanly, EMDS Executive Director, and Mr. Elnur Mammedov, leader of the Public Association for International
Cooperation Volunteers (PAICV), were summonsed to appear before the Investigation
Department of the Prosecutor General for Serious Crimes in Azerbaijan for
interrogation in relation to an investigation opened on October 27 by the same
department against the EMDS (see below). Later the same
day, Mr. Anar Mammadli was brought before the Nasimi District Court of Baku,
where he was ordered to be held in pre-trial detention for a period of three
months for violating Article
192.2.2 and Article 308.2 of the Criminal Code (see below). The two others were
released. Mr. Mammadli was not given the opportunity to call his own lawyer and
was represented by a lawyer appointed by the court. On December 17, 2013, he
could finally contact his lawyer, who has now lodged a complaint regarding his
arrest. In the week of December 23, 2013, the court will decide whether Mr.
Mammadli will be released until the next hearing in his case. The date of this
hearing is still unknown. In the meantime Mr. Mammadli remains in the Pre-Trial
Detention Centre No. 1 in Baku.
 
EMDS was de-registered in 2008, but has
continued its work. Mr. Anar Mammadli's and EMDS became a target of the
Prosecutor in the aftermath of the presidential elections of October 9, 2013,
as EMDS published a report on electoral irregularities. On October 31, 2013,
during a search conducted in the EMDS offices, print materials, press releases,
reports, and financial documents were confiscated, as well as two computers.
Since then, Mr. Mammadli, along with EMDS, has been put under investigation for
“tax evasion”, “illegal business activity”, and “abuse of authority”. During
the questioning, members of EMDS were told that the suspicions relate to the
receipt of a large amount of foreign funding. Authorities
allege that Mr. Mammadli is in
violation of Article 192.2.2 of the Criminal Code of Azerbaijan - prohibition
of “'business activity by an organised group without registration in the order
provided by the legislation of the Azerbaijan Republic”, punishable by up to
five years' imprisonment. However, this provision applies only to commercial
enterprises and not to not-for-profit organisations like EMDS. Mr. Mammadli
would also be prosecuted under Article 308.2 of the Criminal Code, allegedly
for intending to influence the election results. In this framework, on
November 26, 2013, Mr. Anar Mammadli and four other staff members of EMDS cancelled
their plans to attend the EU East Partnership Summit in Vilnius, Lithuania, in
order to respect the prohibition on leaving the country during their
investigation.
 
The
Observatory notes that since its de-registration, EMDS has applied on numerous
occasions for its re-registration, but the authorities systematically denied
its requests, thus placing the NGO in a vulnerable situation. The EMDS has lodged an application with the European Court of Human
Rights challenging this situation.
 
The
Observatory firmly condemns the arbitrary arrest and pre-trial detention of Mr. Anar Mammadli and considers it
another in the series of efforts aimed at preventing the documentation,
reporting, and critical assessment of irregularities in electoral processes,
especially the presidential elections of October 9, 2013.

The Observatory therefore calls on the
Azerbaijani authorities to
immediately and unconditionally release Mr. Anar Mammadli, to allow the EMDS
to register and to stop interfering in its work. 
 
Action requested:
 
Please write to the authorities in Azerbaijan, urging them to:
 
i.   
Guarantee
in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Anar Mammadli as well as of all human
rights defenders in Azerbaijan;
 
ii.  
Release
Mr. Anar Mammadli immediately
and unconditionally as his detention is arbitrary since it only aims at
sanctioning his human rights activities;
 
iii. Put an end to any kind of harassment - including at
the judicial level - against Mr. Mammadli and
more generally against all human rights defenders in Azerbaijan and
ensure in all circumstances that they are able to carry out their work without
unjustified hindrances;
 
iv.  Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on
Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations
on December 9, 1998, especially its Article 1, which states that “everyone has
the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to
strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental
freedoms at the national and international levels”, as well as its Article
12.2, which provides that the State shall “take all necessary measures to
ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually
and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de
facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action
as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of his or her rights”; 
 
v.  
Ensure
in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in
accordance with international human rights standards and international
instruments ratified by Azerbaijan.
