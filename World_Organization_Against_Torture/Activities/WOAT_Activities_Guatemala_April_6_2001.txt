Brief description of the situation :  The Observatory has been informed by Casa Alianza that, on the morning of April 2, 2001, the agency’s offices on the 4th Avenue in Zone 1 of Guatemala City had been broken into and a series of files had been ransacked.   According to the information received, at least two unidentified people broke into the second floor of the two storey office building which houses the Casa Alianza Street Educators and the Legal Aid Program. The street educators’ metal files, where the information on the individual street children attended to in the street is stored, were forced open and hundreds of files were strewn around. It is as yet unclear whether any files were stolen, but two digital cameras have been reported missing.  The break-in comes at a time when several other non-governmental agencies in Guatemala have also reported burglaries, according to Casa Alianza, who’s offices had also received a series of strange phone calls and increasingly frequent visits by the police during the week preceding this incident. The break-in and theft were immediately reported to the police and investigative authorities, who, according to the information received, were able to find several sets of finger-prints at the scene of the crime.  Actions requested :  Please write to the Guatemalan authorities urging them to :  i. guarantee an immediate investigation into the circumstances of these events, identify those responsible, bring them before a civil competent and impartial tribunal and apply the penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions provided by law;  ii. take all necessary measures to stop any kind of harassment against human rights defenders and their organisations;  iii. ensure the implementation of the provisions of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders in particular its Article 1 which provides that "Every person has the right, individually or collectively, to promote the protection and fulfilment of human rights and fundamental liberties at the national and international level" and its article 5.b which provides that “for the purpose of promoting and protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms, everyone has the rights, individually or in association with others, at the national and international levels to form, join and participate in non-governmental organisations, associations or groups."
