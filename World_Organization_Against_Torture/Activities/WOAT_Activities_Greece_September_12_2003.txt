Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Greek Helsinki Monitor (GHM), a member of the OMCT network, that an unaccompanied minor, Nagar Ali Abdyin, citizen of Sudan, who states to be born in 1988, has been illegally held in detention in the former “Voice of America” facility along with adults, for the last 15 days. He arrived in Rhodes with 24 other aliens on 25th August 2003. His sister, Emtithal Ali Abdein Mohamed Ahmed, and her husband Abuobeida Abdalla Eljak, are legal residents of Denmark. Nagar Ali Abdyin is entitled to be set free immediately in Greece and file for reunification with his sister but is still currently held in detention by the Greek authorities.   According to the information received there has been no mobilization from the part of the police authorities of Rhodes, which detain the minor asylum seeker along with adults. They have not interviewed him in order to proceed, as provided by relevant legislation, to further action, such as informing the Prosecutor’s Office, according to the Greek legislation. Greek Police (ELAS) of Rhodes, when asked on 8 September, claimed ignorance about the presence of an unaccompanied minor among the detainees.  GHM requested the Greek Ombudsman and the Minister of Justice’s Office for their contribution in securing the minor’s best interest, as they had also shown interest in the previous case of the two unaccompanied minors from Somalia (see OMCT appeal GRC 260803.CC).  OMCT is concerned by this case, as it is the second one taking place in the last three months. It demonstrates the urgent need for all ELAS services to be fully informed of the relevant procedures to be followed in cases of unaccompanied minors entering Greece, seeking asylum or reunification with their families residing in another EU country.  Remarks  In reference to case GRC 260803.CC, OMCT welcomes the fact that Swedish authorities have finally provided the two Somali minors with the necessary documents and that they are now in the process of being reunited with their mother.  Action requested  Please write to the authorities in Greece and in Denmark urging them to: . i.	bring this urgent case to the attention of the prosecuting authorities of Rhodes in order to assume temporary custody of the child, as provided under law, and to take all necessary actions in order to ensure that his rights are fully respected and that he is soon reunited with his sister; ii.	urge the Danish Authorities to speedily and favorably review the reunification application; iii.	take all necessary measures to ensure that aliens who enter illegally in Greece are treated with full respect of human rights; that their asylum applications are duly accepted and registered; that they are not detained while awaiting answers to those applications and in any way beyond the lawful three months, and that they are provided with adequate shelter; and that children are not held with adults and unaccompanied children are not held at all but placed in appropriate reception centers; iv.	guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws international human rights standards, particularly the Convention on the Rights of the Child.
