The Observatory for the
Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the International
Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation Against Torture
(OMCT), requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in Thailand.
 
Description of the situation:
 
The Observatory has been
informed by reliable sources of the arbitrary arrest of Mr. Prom Jarana,
a member of the Assembly of the Poor, a grassroots people’s movement that works
for the protection and promotion of land rights.
 
According to the information
received, on July 17, 2014, at 10.30 am, Thai police and army personnel
arrested Mr. Prom Jarana at his home in Baan Hoo Tam Nob Village, Phakam
District, Buriram Province. The arresting officers informed Mr. Prom that he
would be taken to the Somdet Chaopraya Mahakasatsuk military camp. Mr. Prom was
not informed of the reason for his arrest.
 
The Observatory believes
that Mr. Prom was arrested in connection with his activities for the protection
and promotion of human rights. On July 15, 2014, Mr. Prom joined a delegation
of the Assembly of the Poor to Bangkok. The delegation gathered at the Thai
Army headquarters to demand that the ruling junta, the National Council for
Peace and Order (NCPO), put an end to the ongoing forced evictions of villagers
by soldiers from the Thai 2nd Army in six villages of Non Din Daeng District,
Buriram Province. On July
16, Mr. Prom visited Kao Baat, one of the villages affected by the forced
evictions.
 
At the time of the release
of this Urgent Appeal, no charges had been formally framed against Mr. Prom
Jarana and there is still no clear information on his current location. 
 
The Observatory condemns the arbitrary arrest of Mr. Prom Jarana, which seems to merely
aim at sanctioning his peaceful human rights activities, and calls upon the
authorities of Thailand to release him immediately and unconditionally.
 
Background
information:
 
Between June 27 and July 2, 2014,
soldiers from the Thai 2nd Army entered six villages, Kao Baat, Saeng Sawan,
Talat Khwai, Pa Mamuang, Klong Hin Mai and Sam Salueng villages in Non Ding
Daeng District, Buriram Province, and ordered residents to demolish their own homes
and leave the area. Soldiers spray-painted the relocation deadlines, ranging
from July 7 to July 10, on the villagers’ homes. Soldiers also warned villagers
that they would be forcibly evicted from their homes if they failed to comply
with their eviction orders. 
 
There were about 300 households
with a total of more than 1,000 people in the six villages affected by the
relocation orders. In Saeng Sawan Village, more than 50 households refused to
relocate. Similarly, about 40 people in Kao Baat Village, mostly women and
children, refused to leave their homes. 
 
The Thai Army did not provide any
compensation or assistance to those who agreed under duress to vacate their
homes. The two relocation sites, located in the rubber plantation area of Pa
Yaang Sabkhaning, about six kilometers north of the Pa Mamuang Village, and at
the Lam Nang Rong Buddhist temple grounds, about 15 kilometers south of Talat
Khwai Village, lack adequate temporary shelters and have no access to water. 
 
The forced evictions were preceded
by a string of arbitrary detentions. On June 28 and 29, soldiers from the Thai
2nd Army detained a total of 10 village leaders from Seang Sawan Village. The
10 were held incommunicado without being charged for seven days at the Somdet
Chaophraya Mahakasatsuk military camp and were not informed of the reason of
their detention.
 
On July 4, 2014, about 20 soldiers
from the Thai 2nd Army took a village leader from his home in Lam Nang Rong
Village, Non Din Daeng District, Buriram Province, and detained him at the
Somdet Chaophraya Mahakasatsuk military camp. He was released after being held
incommunicado for about 10 hours. The day before, he had approached local
military commanders to ask them whether the NCPO’s announcement that it would
crack down on forest encroachments would apply to the situation of villagers in
Non Din Daeng District. On July 12, 2014, Thai Army soldiers in Saeng Sawang
Village briefly detained local activist Mr. Paiboon Soisot and
ordered him to leave the community or face legal action.
 
It is believed that the Thai
Army’s crackdown stemmed from Order Nos. 64 and 66, issued by the ruling junta,
the NCPO, on June 14 and 17, 2014 respectively. The two orders empowered
government agencies to take action to put an end to encroachment on forest
reserves nationwide. However, villagers claim that the area they inhabited was
no longer classed as ‘forest reserve’ and should be redistributed among local
communities in accordance with the 1964 National Forest Reserve Act. 
 
The area has a long history of
forced relocation of villagers as part of the Thai government’s military
campaign against Thai Communist Party’s guerrilla operating in the area in the
1970s and early 1980s. In the next two decades, successive Thai governments
failed to return the land to the communities who had originally inhabited it.
 
Actions requested:
 
Please
write to the authorities of Thailand asking them to:
 
i.      Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity
of Mr.
Prom Jarana as well as all human rights defenders in Thailand;
 
ii.     Release Mr. Prom Jarana immediately
and unconditionally since his detention is arbitrary and only aims at
sanctioning his human rights activities;
 
iii.   Put an end to all acts of harassment, including at the judicial level,
against Mr.
Prom Jarana as well as against all human rights
defenders in Thailand;
 
iv.    Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights
Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9,
1998, especially its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right,
individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the
protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the
national and international levels”, and Article 12.2, which provides that “the
State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the
competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others,
against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse
discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his
or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present
Declaration”;
 
v.     Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental
freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and
international instruments ratified by Thailand.
