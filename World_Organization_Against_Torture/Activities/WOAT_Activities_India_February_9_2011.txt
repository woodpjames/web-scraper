The International
Secretariat of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) requests your
URGENT intervention in
the following situation in India/ West Bengal. 
Brief description of the situation
The International Secretariat of OMCT has been
informed by Banglar Manabadhikar
Suraksha Mancha (MASUM), a member of OMCT SOS-Torture Network, about
the killing of Mr. Tiarul Sk., a
Muslim man aged about 20 years, from Kalbalitala village, Murshidabad district
in West Bengal, by Border Security Force
(BSF). OMCT is gravely concerned that to date, there has been reportedly no
effective investigation into this killing. 
According to the information
received, on 27 November 2010 at about 6pm, Mr. Tiarul Sk. was shot and killed by members of
the BSF on-duty at the Kaharpara BSF Out-Post No. III. Mr. Tiarul Sk was
reportedly checking his crops on a field located on the southern side of the
Kaharpara BSF Out-Post No. III when a group of individuals smuggling cattle
nearby were spotted by the BSF. The latter allegedly opened fire indiscriminately
and without warning. Mr. Tiarul Sk. was hit in his chest by a bullet. His body
was reportedly removed only around 11pm by Raninagar
Police and taken to Godhanpara Primary Health Centre where he was declared
dead. The police registered an unnatural death case vide Raninagar Police
Station (case no. 27/2010).
It is reported that, on the
following day, an Executive Magistrate from Domkal conducted an inquest on the
body, in violation of the Indian law which requires that the inquest in a case of death is only conducted by
a judicial magistrate (Section 176 1-A of Criminal Procedure Code), before the body was taken to Lalbagh
Sub-Divisional Hospital for the post mortem examination. On the same day, Mr.
Tiarul Sk’s father lodged a written complaint at the Raninagar Police Station
against the alleged BSF members (Case no. 651/2010 dated 302). However, to
date, there has been reportedly no effective investigation into the killing of
Mr. Tiarul Sk. On the contrary,
the BSF reportedly lodged a complaint on their side in order to disguise the
incident as an encounter killing to justify the death of Mr. Tiarul Sk.
The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned about the alleged
aforementioned facts and recalls that the authorities
have to fulfil their obligations under international human rights law to
protect the right to life. State authorities must
ensure that security forces comply with international human rights standards on
law enforcement, in particular those relating to the use of force.
OMCT is also deeply concerned by the delays in
initiating an effective investigation into the killing of Mr. Tiarul Sk.
Accordingly, OMCT calls on the competent authorities to ensure that the
investigation is carried out promptly, effectively, thoroughly, independently and impartially, the
result of which must be made public, in order to bring those responsible before a competent, independent and
impartial tribunal and apply penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions as
provided by law.
Action requested
Please write to the
authorities in India/ West Bengal urging them to:
i.           Carry
out a prompt, effective, thorough, independent and impartial investigation
into the killing of Mr.
Tiarul Sk., the result of which must be made public, in order to bring those responsible before a
competent, independent and impartial tribunal and apply penal, civil and/or
administrative sanctions as provided by law;
iii.        Ensure
that an effective remedy as well as the right to full redress, including
compensation, is granted to the victim’s family concerned; 
iv.        Guarantee
the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country
in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
