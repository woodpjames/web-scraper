New information: The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the release on bail of Ms. Negin Sheikholeslami, the founder and Director of the women’s rights NGO Azar Mehr and an active member of the “One Million Signatures” Campaign[1]. According to the information received, on November 23, 2008, Ms. Negin Sheikholeslami was released from Section 209 of Evin Prison in Tehran, on a bail of 500,000,000 rials (about 36,816 euros). As of issuing this urgent appeal, no date had yet been set for her trial, and there was no further information on the charges she is facing. Ms. Negin Sheikholeslami had been arrested on October 4, 2008, by security officers at her home in Tehran. The Observatory welcomes Ms. Negin Sheikholeslami’s release on bail, and thank all the persons, institutions and organisations who intervened in her favour. However, the Observatory expresses its deep concern about the charges against her, and, more generally, strongly condemns the increasing repression of the Iranian authorities against human rights defenders, in particular women’s rights activists involved in the “One Million Signatures” Campaign. Furthermore, the Observatory wishes to insist on the fact that Iran had committed to “uphold the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights”[2] by presenting its candidacy to the Human Rights Council 2006 election and had insisted in this regard on the fact that the country had “continuously put great efforts into safeguarding the status and inherent dignity of the human person as well as the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms”[3]. In order to ensure the continuation of these efforts, the Observatory urges the Islamic Republic of Iran to conform with international human rights standards. Actions requested: Please write to the authorities in Iran urging them to:   Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Ms. Negin Sheikholeslami, as well as all activists engaged in the “One Million Signatures” campaign;  Drop all arbitrary charges against all women’s rights defenders involved in the “One million signatures” campaign;  Put an end to all acts of harassment, including at the judicial level, against Ms. Negin Sheikholeslami and all Iranian human rights defenders;  Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, Article 6.b, which provides that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others [...] freely to publish, impart or disseminate to others views, information and knowledge on all human rights and fundamental freedoms”, and Article 12.2, which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”;  More generally, ensure in all circumstances the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with international and regional human rights instruments ratified by Iran.
