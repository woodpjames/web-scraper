Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by a Sudanese Organisation Against Torture (SOAT), a member of the OMCT network, of the arbitrary arrest, torture and extra-judicial execution of 168 members of the Fur tribe in Sudan.  According to the information received, officers from military intelligence and militia leaders (Janjaweed) reportedly arrested 168 people all belongs to the Fur tribe, and then summarily executed them between March 5th and 7th, 2004, at the security offices in Delaij, Wadi Salih province, Western Darfur State. The names of 118 of these persons, as well as more in-depth background information concerning the ongoing conflict and the deterioration of the situation in Darfur, can be found in the annexed document. The arrests took place in the villages of Zaray, Fairgo, Tairgo and Kaskildo, all south of Garsilla, Wadi Salih province. They were detained for alleged involvement with the Sudan Liberation Army (SLA) and taken to the security offices in Delaij, a village 30 kilometres east of Garsilla town, Wadi Salih province. During their detention the 168 people were allegedly subjected to torture and were then summarily executed by a firing squad. Reports indicate that they were executed outside of the judicial process and that their rights, which are provided for by Sudanese law and international law were violated.  This information were provided by eyewitness and tribal leaders from the place where the 168 people were executed.
