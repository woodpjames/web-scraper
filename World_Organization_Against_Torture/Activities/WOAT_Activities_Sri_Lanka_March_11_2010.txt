The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in Sri Lanka.
Brief description of the situation:
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the defamation campaign against Mr. J. C. Weliamuna, Executive Director of Transparency International - Sri Lanka (TISL), an organisation involved in revealing the abuse of public resources in the context of the Sri Lankan presidential elections of January 26, 2010[1].
According to the information received, during the last weeks, Mr. J. C. Weliamuna has been the target of a string of defamation articles published in local Sinhalese and English printed media containing false information about the misuse of TISL's funds. The articles also portray TISL in the framework of a wider campaign carried out by the Government against national and international non-governmental organisations, accusing them of trying to destabilise the country and announcing that the Act dealing with these organisations will be amended to take proper action against them whenever it is necessary.
On March 3, 2010, an article published in Lanka News Web stated that Mr. Weliamuna heads a list of 35 human rights defenders and journalists supportive of the opposition. The list was allegedly produced by the Sri Lankan intelligence services. Dr. Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu, Executive Director of the NGO the Centre for Policy Alternatives, would also be on this list.
According to the information received, there would also be a move to arrest and detain Mr. Weliamuna on fabricated charges, in connection with reports Transparency International issued during the presidential election campaign in December and January, alleging violations of election laws and misuse of public resources by the ruling party.
Previously, on September 27, 2008, two grenades were thrown at Mr. Weliamuna's residence. One grenade exploded on the balcony and damaged the building, while the other was found unexploded inside the house[2]. Recently, the Sri Lankan Government argued that Mr. Weliamuna was responsible of this attack in order to get publicity for himself.
Despite Mr. Weliamuna's letter to the President of Sri Lanka, there has been no action taken to provide protection to him or to investigate the allegations regarding the list.
The Observatory strongly condemns the defamation campaign against Mr. J. C. Weliamuna as well as any judicial or administrative proceedings against him, and fears for his physical and psychological integrity. The Observatory further condemns the attempts of the government to discredit the work of TISL and other national and international human rights organisations. The Observatory calls upon the Sri Lankan authorities to put an immediate end to the harassment against Mr. J. C. Weliamuna, which seem to merely aims at sanctioning his human rights activities, and to refrain from arresting him.
Actions requested:
Please write to the authorities of Sri Lanka asking them to:

 Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. J. C. Weliamuna, Mr. Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu, all members of Transparency International - Sri Lanka as well as of all human rights defenders in Sri Lanka;
 Put an end to all acts of harassment, including at the judicial level, against Mr. J. C. Weliamuna as well against all human rights defenders, national and international organisations in Sri Lanka;
 Order an immediate, thorough, effective and impartial investigation into the above-mentioned acts of harassment, the result of which must be made public, in order to identify those responsible, bring them before a competent and impartial tribunal and apply to them the sanctions provided by the law;
 Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its Article 12.2, which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”;
 Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.
