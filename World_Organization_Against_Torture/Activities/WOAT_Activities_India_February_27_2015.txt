The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint
programme of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and the
International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), requests your urgent
intervention in the following situation in India.
 
Description of the situation:
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the
arbitrary arrest and remand to judicial custody of Mr. Kalimuthu Kandhasamy, District Organiser of Citizens for Human
Rights Movement (CHRM), a non-registered people’s organisation founded by
People’s Watch, which provides legal assistance and counsel to victims of human
rights violations in Tamil Nadu. Mr. Kandhasamy was charged with several crimes
including impersonating a public servant, cheating, and improper use of emblems[1].
 
According to the information received, on February 25, at about 7.15
p.m. Mr. Kandhasamy was arrested at his residence in Ramanthapuram (Tamil Nadu)
by police personnel from the Kenikkarai Police Station, and subsequently
remanded to judicial custody. No warrant or arrest memo was reportedly
presented at the time of his arrest.
 
The charges against M. Kandhasamy are related to the fact that the name
of his organisation, the “Citizens for Human Rights Movement” (CHRM), violates
the provisions of the Tamil Nadu Societies Registration Act, which provide that
no non-governmental institution should have the term “human rights” in its
name.
 
However, neither Mr. Kandhasamy nor the CHRM have presented themselves
as a public authority, and the Observatory notes that there is no evidence
supporting the charges of cheating filed against Mr. Kandhasamy by the
Inspector of Police. 
 
Furthermore, it is especially worrisome that Mr. Kandhasamy is a heart
patient who had very recently consulted a medical specialist with complaints of
kidney stones requiring medical attention.
 
The Observatory condemns the arbitrary arrest of Mr. Kandhasamy, as well
as the charges against him, which are directly related to his legitimate and
peaceful human rights activities. 
 
Accordingly, the Observatory calls on the authorities to immediately and
unconditionally release Mr. Kandhasamy and to drop all charges held against
him.
 
The Observatory is further concerned by the provisions of the Tamil Nadu
Societies Registration Act prohibiting the use of the words “human rights”,
which blatantly violate international human rights standards as they pose direct
obstacles to the legitimate conduct of human rights activities and freedom of
association.
 
Actions requested:
 
Please write to the authorities of India asking them to:
 
      i.       
Immediately and
unconditionally release of Mr. Kandhasamy and drop all charges held against
him; 
     ii.       
Guarantee in all
circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Kandhasamy, as
well as of all human rights defenders in India;
    iii.       
Reform the
restrictive Tamil Nadu Societies Registration Act in order to allow the
population, particularly human rights defenders, to participate to human rights
activities within the framework of the civil society and non-governmental
organisations in the country;
    iv.       
Comply with all the
provisions of the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, in
particular with:
-       Article 1, which provides that “everyone has the right, individually and
in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and
realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and
international levels”; and-   Article 12.2, which provides that “the State shall
take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent
authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against
any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination,
pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her
legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”;
     v.       
Ensure in all
circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance
with international human rights standards and international instruments
ratified by India.
