Alleged ill-treatment/ Lack of a proper investigation

The International Secretariat of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) requests your URGENT intervention in the following situation in India/ West Bengal.
Brief description of the situation
The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by Banglar Manabadhikar Suraksha Mancha (MASUM), a member of OMCT SOS-Torture Network, about the alleged ill-treatment inflicted on Mr. Govinda Mondal, a 35-year-old jute farmer, residing in the village of Char Rajapur, District Murshidabad, by Border Security Force (BSF) constables.
According to the information received, on 6 August 2010, at about 2:20pm, Mr. Govinda Mondal was on his small farming land making a phone call when three BSF constables caught him. The three involved BSF constables were identified as elements of the Char Mou Rashi Border Out Post, “E” Company under Battalion Number 52.
The BSF constables reportedly dragged Mr. Govinda Mondal to a nearby mud-built house after having grabbed his mobile phone. They took off his clothes and forcibly put one piece into his mouth. Then, they allegedly beat him for about one hour and a half particularly on his feet, chest and face, with the wooden handle of a spade, until Mr. Govinda Mondal lost consciousness. The BSF constables subsequently left the place. Mr. Govinda Mondal was recovered by two locals who brought him back to his house. He was later admitted to the Lalbagh S.D. Hospital where he remained until 10 August 2010. He was also checked by specialists and given medicine in the framework of a medical examination organised by MASUM.
According to the same information, on 14 August 2010, Mr. Govinda Mondal lodged a complaint against the aforementioned BSF constables at Raninagar Police Station. The police registered a First Information Report (FIR), case no. 418/10 under Sections 341 (Wrongfully restraining any person), 323 (Voluntary causing hurt), 325 (Voluntarily causing grievous hurt) and 34 (Common intention) of the Indian Penal Code. However, to this date, there has been reportedly no effective investigation into the alleged facts.
The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned about the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Govinda Mondal. OMCT wishes to recall that according to article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which India is a State Party, “no one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment”. OMCT is also deeply concerned by the delays in initiating an investigation into these allegations and fears that the perpetrators may enjoy impunity. Indeed, OMCT has reported several cases in which local police having jurisdiction along the Indo-Bangladesh border have consistently avoided taking any action against the BSF whenever a crime is reported against a BSF officer at the police station.
Accordingly, OMCT calls on the competent authorities to carry out a prompt, effective, thorough, independent and impartial investigation into these events, in particular the allegations of ill-treatment, the result of which must be made public, in order to bring those responsible before a competent, independent and impartial tribunal and apply penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions as provided by law.
