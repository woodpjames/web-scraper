Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by reliable sources of the arrest, detention and ill-treatment of a number of children during the month of December 1999.  According to the information received, on 20 December, Seyed Murtada Seyed Jaffar Seyed Salman (aged 14) from Shakhora, was snatched from his parent’s house late at night and tortured for a day and a half.  He had previously been arrested 6 months before without charges or trial.  On 15 December, Hussein Isa Atiyah, (aged 14), form Abu Sayb’a, was arrested as he stood outside his parent’s house early evening that day.  According to reports, he was viciously beaten before his release the following day.  Also on 15 December, Mohammed Khalil Ebrahim Mohammed, (aged 17), from Sanad, was arrested, and his parent’s house contents were vandalized by security forces.  His mother was also arrested when she attempted to inquire about the reasons for which her son was being arrested.  These cases are part of the ongoing political unrest and the widespread popular movement calling for political reforms and the restoration of democracy.   On 26 August 1975, Amiri Act No. 14 was issued dissolving the National Assembly. Subsequently, Amiri Act No. 4 /1975 was issued suspending Article 65 of the Constitution and other articles relevant to the organization of parliamentary life. These two Acts, which are still in force, constitute a violation of Articles 65, 32/a, and 42 of the Constitution. The constitution establishes that in such an event elections for a new assembly must be held within two months. The ruling family has steadfastly refused to do it, and this refusal is one major factor underlying the current unrest.  These persons were arrested under the 1974 State Security Law which allows for the detention of a person without charge or trial for up to three years and sets a special court system "the State Security Court", a procedure of which falls short of International standards for fair trial.  Action requested  Please write to the Bahrain authorities urging that they :   i.	take all necessary measures to guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of the aforementioned persons held in detention, and order their immediate release in the absence of valid legal charges or, if such charges exist, bring them before an impartial and competent tribunal and guarantee their procedural rights in all times;  ii.	carry out a full and impartial investigation into the alleged arbitrary detentions, in order to identify those responsible, bring them to trial and apply the penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions provided by law;  iii.	put an immediate end to the use of arbitrary detention of  people, especially children, by the police and abrogate 1974 State Security Law and all national laws which are not in compliance with international human rights standards.   iv.	guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international standards, in particular those established in the Convention against Torture, and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, both ratified by Bahrain.
