Russian Federation
January 23, 2013The Observatory for the 
Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the 
International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World 
Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent intervention 
in the following situation in the Russian Federation.
Description of the situation:

The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about threats received by Mr. Vitaly Ponomarev, Head of Central Asia programme at the Moscow-based Human Rights Centre (HRC) “Memorial”.

According to the information received, on January 12, 2013, Mr. 
Ponomarev received three emails threatening him and his family with 
death if he ever enters South Kyrgyzstan. The emails were sent at 
two-minute intervals to three different addresses. Analysis of the 
emails showed that the they were sent from IP-addresses located in the 
Uzbekistan capital Tashkent.

On January 18, 2013, Mr. Ponomarev received another email following 
the publication of a press release by the HRC “Memorial” earlier the 
same day. This last email was made to look like it was sent from ethnic 
Uzbeks residing in the South of Kyrgyzstan. However, and according to 
linguistic experts, the language used in this email is typical of the 
dialect from the Tashkent area, rather than from Southern Kyrgyzstan.

It is likely that these threats are a response to two press releases
 published on the website of HRC ’Memorial’ on December 10 and 26, 2012,
 both denouncing the activities of the Uzbek security services against 
Uzbek citizens on the Russian territory, including allegations of acts 
of torture against the latter.

HRC “Memorial” has addressed the Federal Security Service and 
Prosecution Service in Moscow following the first set of emails, calling
 for an investigation and that effective measures are taken.

The Observatory strongly condemns the threats against Mr. Ponomarev,
 and fears that they are directly related to his human rights 
activities. Accordingly, the Observatory calls for a thorough, impartial
 and transparent investigation into the above mentioned facts in order 
to identify all those responsible, bring them before a competent and 
impartial tribunal and apply to them the sanctions provided by the law.

Actions requested:

i. Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological 
integrity of Mr. Vitaly Ponomarev and all human rights defenders in the

into the above mentioned facts in order to identify all those
