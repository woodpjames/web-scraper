New information:The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the decision of the Harare Court to refuse to place on remand the Board Trustees of the Voice of the People (VOP) radio station, who were accused of broadcasting without a licence.   According to the information received, on September 25, 2006, a hearing against VOP trustees Messrs. David Masunda, Nhlanhla Ngwenya, Lawrence Chibwe, Millicent Phiri, Arnold Tsunga, John Masuku and Mrs. Isabella Matambanadzo resumed before the Harare Magistrate’s Court. They were being accused of contravening section 7(1) of the Broadcasting Services Act Chapter 12:06 as read with Section 6 (a) (b), which prohibits “broadcasting without a licence”. Mrs. Maria Nyanyiwa, Mrs. Nyasha Bosha and Mrs. Kundai Mugwanda, journalists with VOP, were also facing similar charges. The three of them had been held for four days in December 2005 after the police searched the radio studios in the centre of the capital. They all had been released on bail (See background information).  When the hearing started, the Prosecutor argued that the case should be brought against VOP as a trust and not against the 10 individual members of staff and Board of Trustees as was the present situation. In this view, he stated that he had to ascertain that VOP was registered at the Registrar of Companies at the Deeds Office before charging VOP as a trust, and therefore requested to postpone the hearing to November 7, 2006, and to place on remand the accused persons until then. Once it would have had a chance to do so, then the State would withdraw the charges.  However, the Magistrate at the Court of Harare, ruled in favour of the defence, who was against any postponement of the hearing as the State had indicated as early as January 24, 2006 that it was ready to go to trial. However, the trial had already been postponed twice. Indeed, the Magistrate stated that he saw no reason why the accused should be placed on remand.  The Observatory welcomes this decision of the Court of Harare but recalls that, for now on, the Magistrate did not rule that the VOP trustees are free to go back to operating as VOP, nor did he order the return to their offices of the equipment seized by the police in their raid of December 2005. No indication was given concerning the date of the next hearing.  Background information:  On January 25, 2006, Mr. Arnold Tsunga, also Chairman of the Zimbabwe Human Rights Association (Zimrights), Executive Director of Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights (ZLHR), along with Mr. David Masunda, Mr. Millicent Phiri, Mr. Lawrence Chibwe, Mr. Nhlahla Ngwenya and Mrs. Isabella Matambanadzo, had been arrested and charged with “broadcasting without a license” (section 7.1 of the Broadcasting Services Act), a charge carrying a penalty of up to two years imprisonment. On that day, all were released on bail, but five of them, including Mr. Tsunga, had to report weekly before the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) Law and Order.  A preliminary hearing was held on February 28, 2006, at which a Magistrate decided not to accept the defence’s submission that there was insufficient evidence to send the case to full trial.   On June 15, 2006, there was a short hearing during which the Prosecution applied to change the magistrate, to which the defence objected (See joint press release of the Observatory and the International Commission of Jurists, June 15, 20061 ). Although this application was in the end not granted, the Prosecution was granted an adjournment to September 25 - 28, 2006.  1 On June 15, 2006, the Observatory and ICJ had mandated an observer to attend the hearing in the trial against Mr. Arnold Tsunga before the Rotten Row Magistrates’ Court in Harare  Action requested : Please write to the Zimbabwean authorities, urging them to : i.

Put an end to all acts of harassment against all human rights defenders in Zimbabwe;  iv.
