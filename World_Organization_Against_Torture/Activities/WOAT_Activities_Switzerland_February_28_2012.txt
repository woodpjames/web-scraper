the creation of a war crimes unit in Switzerland
Since January 2011, Switzerland disposes of a thorough legal arsenal for
prosecuting war criminals and other torturers present on Swiss territory. But
the practical means available in this respect are clearly insufficient as
criminals often use Western countries as a refuge and manage to stay there
without any worries. Consequently, Switzerland should set up a special unit in charge
of tracking down international crimes, following the example of several other
European States.
