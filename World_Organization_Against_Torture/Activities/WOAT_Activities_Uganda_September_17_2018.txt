No computer, camera, printer or other valuables were taken, which makes the hypothesis of theft less likely and suggests that the real intent of the break-in was intimidation. This was the third break-in of TLC’s premises in a month.  On August 31, 2018, another break-in of the office was registered, and a TV set and a computer cable were stolen. TLC representatives reported the case to the police. After this break-in, TLC changed and enhanced all its door locks to prevent further door breaks.  On August 6, 2018, while at office in the morning, TLC’s staff observed that the main office door had been broken. The locks had been broken and an unidentified person had accessed the office. Two extension cables, one laptop cable and one jacket coat were stolen.  Following the accident, the locks had been replaced.  The Observatory recalls that TLC members have been repeatedly harassed over the past two years. On June 23, 2017, Mr. Erasmus Irumba[2], TLC’s coordinator in Ntoroko District, was murdered while investigating the misuse of public funds in health services. On September 12, 2017, Mr. James Rukampena, another member of the organisation, was shot in both legs by private security guards while campaigning for the right of rural local communities in Kabarole District to access their natural resources.Four members of TLC were subjected to spurious charges in the lawsuit opposing them to Ferdsult Engineering Services Limited, the company that obtained exclusive rights over the 20 crater lakes sustaining the livelihoods of these communities. These different security threats and the failure of the police to conclude transparent investigations and bring perpetrators to justice impacted negatively TLC’s capacities to work.   The Observatory expresses its deepest concern about the repetition of break-ins in TLC’s office premises, which seems to be aimed at intimidating its members and prevent their legitimate human rights activities, and urges the authorities of Uganda to ensure that the physical and psychological integrity of TLC representatives is guaranteed and to carry-out an immediate, thorough, transparent investigation into the above-mentioned facts. Actions requested: Please write to the authorities of Uganda asking them to: i. Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of TLC representatives and related personnel, as well as all human rights defenders in Uganda; ii. Carry-out an immediate, thorough, transparent investigation into the above-mentioned break-ins and thefts in order to identify all those responsible, bring them before an independent tribunal, and apply them the sanctions provided by the law;iii. Guarantee in all circumstances that human rights defenders and organisations in Uganda are able to carry out their legitimate human rights activities without fear of reprisals;iv. Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its Articles 1, 5 and 12.2;v. Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by Uganda. Addresses:• President Kaguta Yoweri Museveni, President of the Republic of Uganda, Fax: +256 (0) 414 436 102 / + 256 41 4235459 / +256 41 4344012.
