Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Sudanese Organisation Against Torture (SOAT), a member of the OMCT network, of the arrest and risk of torture of student Mohamed Saeif Al Dawla Ahmed Hassan in Sudan.  According to the information received, on Wednesday, September 17th, 2003, Mohamed Saeif Al Dawla Ahmed Hassan was arrested by the National Security Agency (NSA) in Atbara, northern Sudan. The arrest took place at 11 a.m. at the entrance of the Faculty of Education, Wadi Al Nile University in Atbara. He was taken to the NSA offices, and his friends were not allowed to see him. They have reason to fear that he is being subjected to torture due to the reputation of the National Security Agency. The NSA has recently arrested other students from the Faculty of Education, and has in several cases subjected them to torture – they include:   ·	Mohamed Babikr Awad, a second year student, arrested on August 24th, 2003 and released on the August 26th, 2003. He was subjected to torture during detention.  ·	Hassan Al Shaique, a third year student, arrested on August 24th, 2003 and released the same day. He was subjected to torture during detention. ·	Badr Al Deen Awad Babikr, a final year student, arrested on August 24th, 2003 and released on August 28th, 2003.  These student arrests show a marked repression of students' freedom of expression. The arrests have taken place since July 2003, when the Wadi Al Nile University administration issued a new academic examination system, which has led to student protests and the arrest of a number of students, some of whom have been subjected to torture. The university has also expelled and suspended a number of students.   The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned for the personal and psychological integrity of Mr. Mohamed Saeif Al Dawla Ahmed Hassan, especially in light of the allegations of the use of torture against other detained students, and urges the authorities to guarantee his personal integrity, release him immediately in absence of valid legal charges and launch an investigation into the afore-mentioned allegations of torture, in order to bring those responsible to justice and award adequate reparation to the victims of these acts.  Action requested  Please write to the authorities in Sudan urging them to:  i.	take all necessary measures to guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Mohamed Saeif Al Dawla Ahmed Hassan; ii.	order his immediate release in the absence of legal charges that are consistent with international law and standards, or, if such charges exist, bring him before an impartial and competent tribunal and guarantee their procedural rights at all times; iii.	order a thorough and impartial investigation into the circumstances of these events, notably the allegations of the use of torture against student detainees, in order to identify those responsible, bring them to trial and apply the penal and/or administrative sanctions as provided by law; iv.	guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
