The charges are still pending against him. If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in jail.  The date of the trial has not been set yet.  The Observatory recalls that the anti-government protests over the fuel prices were severely repressed by security forces: at least 12 persons were shot dead and at least 300 wounded during the crackdown on protesters; around 600 people were also arbitrarily arrested[2]. furthermore, the Government blocked temporarily access to Internet and social media, thus hindering the work of human rights defenders and the media who monitored the crisis. The Observatory recalls that this is not the first time that Pastor Mawarire faces arbitrary detention and judicial harassment, as he was already arrested and then released in July 2016, and then September 2016, and February, June and September 2017. On November 29, 2017, the Harare High Court dropped all pending charges of “subverting a constitutional government” against Pastor Mawarire. Those charges were levelled against him in February 2017, for leading demonstrations demanding an end to corruption and the economic crisis.[3] The Observatory welcomes the release on bail of Pastor Mawarire but recalls that it should never have happened in the first place. The Observatory calls the Zimbabwean authorities to put an end to all acts of harassment, including at the judicial level, against  Pastor Mawarire and all human rights defenders in the country.  Background information:  On January 16, 2019, police officers surrounded  Pastor Mawarire’s home in Harare and took him in a police truck two hours later. The Police initially arrested  Pastor Mawarire over the crime of “inciting public violence”.   Pastor Mawarire’s first hearing was scheduled in the morning of January 17, 2019 but the decision to upgrade his charges delayed his appearance before the Court. On January 17, 2019,  Pastor Mawarire appeared before the Harare Court and was charged with “subverting a constitutional government” (section 22 of the Criminal Law Act). If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in jail.  The charges are linked to the nationwide anti-government protests that were triggered by President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s announcement that the fuel price would more than double as the country’s economic crisis is deepening. Pastor Mawarire went public on Facebookand Twitterbefore and during the strikes, calling for Zimbabweans to support peacefully a stay-at-home strike called by the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU).  Actions requested: Please write to the authorities of Zimbabwe asking them to: i.Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Pastor  Mawarire and all human rights defenders in Zimbabwe; ii. Put an end to all acts of harassment, including at the judicial level, against Pastor Mawarire and all human rights defenders in Zimbabwe, and ensure that they are able to carry out their activities without hindrance; iii. Conform to the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially Articles 1 and 12; and iv.
