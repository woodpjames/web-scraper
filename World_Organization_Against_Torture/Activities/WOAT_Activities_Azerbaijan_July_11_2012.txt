The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights
Defenders, a joint programme of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH)
and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent
intervention in the following situation in Azerbaijan.
 
Description of the situation: 
 
The Observatory has
been informed by the Human Rights Centre of Azerbaijan (HRCA) about the arrest,
arbitrary detention and judicial harassment of Mr. Hilal Mammadov, a
minority rights defender and editor-in-chief of the Tolishi-Sado (Voice
of Talysh) newspaper since June 9, 2012[1].
 
According to the
information received, on June 21, 2012, Mr. Mammadov was arrested in relation
to a criminal case opened against him by the Nizami District Police under
Article 234.4.3 of the Criminal Code (“illegal manufacture, purchase, storage,
transfer, transport or sale of drugs in a large quantity”). The authorities
alleged having seized five grams of heroin from him and about 30 grams at his
place of residence. Article 234.4 provides penalties ranging from confiscation
of property to imprisonment for up to 12 years. On June 22, 2012, the Nizami
District Court sentenced Mr. Hilal Mammadov to 3 months of pre-trial detention.

 
On the same day, Mr. Mammadov met
with his lawyer, who discovered and photographed injuries- on his leg, and
subsequently lodged a complaint for torture. Such complaint remains unanswered
as of issuing this urgent appeal.
 
On July 4, 2012, the accusations of illegal possession of drugs were contradicted by a
joint statement of the Interior Ministry and Prosecutor General of Azerbaijan, which states
that Mr. Mammadov was in reality arrested on June 21, 2012 on the basis of
information about his supposed “cooperation with the intelligence agency of a
foreign country”, “activities against the security and territorial integrity of
Azerbaijan”, as well as “incitement of national, racial and religious hatred”.
According to the authors of the statement, Mr. Mammadov had supposedly become
an agent of foreign secret services 20 years ago.
 
On July 4, 2012, new trumped-up
charges were therefore brought against Mr. Mammadov under other Articles of the
Criminal Code, i.e. Article 274 (“treason”) and Article 283.2.2 (“inciting
national, racial, social and religious hatred, hostility and ethnic
discrimination”). The investigators confiscated as evidence a notebook computer
as well as drives containing information. The criminal case launched against
him by the Nizami District Prosecutor’s Office was transferred to the
Department for Grave Crimes under the General Prosecutor’s Office.
 
Mr. Hilal Mammadov
presently remains detained in the premises of the Investigative Prison in Baku.
 
The Observatory expresses its deep concern about the arbitrary
detention and judicial harassment of Mr. Mammadov, as they seem to only aim at
sanctioning his human rights activities. 
 
The Observatory
underlines in particular that the first edition of the Tolishi-Sado
newspaper under his authority as editor-in-chief was due to be released at the
end of June 2012.
 
The Observatory is all
the more concerned that former Tolishi-Sado editor-in-chief, Mr. Novruzali
Mammedov, was subjected to similar acts of harassment and arbitrary
detention in 2007, and eventually died in custody on August 17, 2009[2].
 
Action requested:
 
Please write to the authorities in Azerbaijan,
urging them to:
 
i.        
Guarantee
in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Hilal
Mammadov as well as of all human rights defenders in Azerbaijan;
 
ii.       Order an immediate, thorough, transparent investigation
into the allegations of torture against Mr. Hilal Mammadov, in order to
identify all those responsible, bring them before an independent tribunal, and
apply them the sanctions provided by the law;
 
iii.     
Release
Mr. Hilal Mammadov immediately and unconditionally as his detention is arbitrary since
it only aims at sanctioning his human rights activities;
 
iv.    
Put
an end to any kind of harassment - including at the judicial level - against
Mr. Hilal Mammadov and more generally against all human rights defenders in
Azerbaijan;
 
v.      
Conform
with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by
the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially
its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in
association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and
realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and
international levels”, as well as its Article 12.2, which provides that the
State shall “take all necessary
measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone,
individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats,
retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other
arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of his or
her rights”; 
 
vi.    
Ensure
in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in
accordance with international human rights standards and international
instruments ratified by Azerbaijan.
