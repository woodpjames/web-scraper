New information:The Observatory has been informed by Human Rights in China (HRIC) that lawyer Zheng Enchong, who was released on June 5, 2006, after serving a three-year prison term for “illegally providing state secrets overseas”, has been put under house arrest and subjected to other restrictions on his personal freedom.  According to the information received, during the sixth annual meeting of the Council of Heads of Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation1, which took place on June 15, 2006, Mr. Zheng was ordered by the Shanghai authorities to remain within the boundaries of his neighbourhood. After the meeting ended, Mr. Zheng’s freedom was restricted further, as he has since then been obliged to remain at home.  On June 27, 2006, Mr. Zheng requested the police officers on watch outside his home to be allowed to go to the local Public Security Bureau (PSB) office to apply for a new identification card. Indeed, under the terms of his release, after the completion of his sentence, Mr. Zheng was required to obtain a new identification card and residency permit by June 15, 2006. A police vehicle finally brought him to the police station, where he was told that the residency officer was not available to process his application.  Moreover, on the morning of June 28, 2006, Mr. Zheng and his wife, Mrs. Jiang Meili, attempted to go to the Shanghai Municipal Government offices to submit a complaint about interference in Mr. Zheng’s application, but they were stopped by four plain clothes police officers. Mr. Zheng was then told that the loss of his political rights, under the terms of his sentence, also denied him any freedom of movement. Mr. Zheng staged a one-hour sit-in front of the office in protest.  Due to the lack of an identification card, Mr. Zheng was reportedly unable to find an employment. In addition, he is still denied any access to court documents relating to his case, and prevented from traveling to Beijing to meet his lawyer.   According to the information received, since Mr. Zheng’s release, the local Zhabei District Guoqing Lu PSB office has called him twice relating to interviews he made with  news media outside of Shanghai. His home’s telephone line has been repeatedly cut off, and his neighbourhood would constantly be surrounded by dozens of uniformed and plain-clothes police officers who bar entry to outsiders.  The Observatory calls on the Chinese authorities to immediately put en end to this harassment against Mr. Zheng Enchong. Mr. Zheng’s additional sentence of one year of deprivation of political rights does not extend to being denied freedom of movement. 1 The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation is a permanent intergovernmental organisation proclaimed in Shanghai on June 15, 2001 by six countries – the People’s Republic of China, the Russian Federation, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. The main purposes of this institution are, amongst others: strengthening mutual trust and good-neighbourly relations among member states; promoting their effective cooperation in political affairs as well as in energy; joint safeguarding and presenting regional peace, security and stability; striving towards creation of democratic, just, reasonable new international political and economic order.  Background information:The Observatory recalls that Mr. Zheng Enchong, who was arrested on June 6, 2003, was sentenced by the Shanghai Second Intermediate People’s Court in October 2003 to three years in prison and deprivation of his political rights for one year, on charges of “illegally providing State secrets to entities outside of China”. In particular, he had been accused of having sent two documents to HRIC. The Shanghai Court of Appeal confirmed this verdict on December 18, 2003 (See Observatory 2004 and 2005 Annual Reports).   On January 13, 2004, Mr. Zheng had been transferred from the Shanghai municipal detention centre to the Tilanquio prison, where he was detained in the “high security” compound and was regularly victim of physical violence.  On October 28, 2005, the Zhabei District Court in Shanghai prohibited Mrs. Jiang Meili from leaving the country under the pretext of an “estate management dispute”, although she was to attend a ceremony in Germany on December 9, 2005 to receive a prize in the name of her husband from the German Association of Judges.  Subsequently, Mrs. Jiang was refused her usually monthly visit to Mr. Zheng in prison, and her every movement has been monitored. Finally, after many written requests, Mrs. Jiang’s prison visits were restored on April 21, 2006.  On May 16, 2006, the Shanghai home of Mr. Zheng Enchong was broken into by two unidentified men while Mrs. Jiang Meili was on her way to visit him in prison.  On June 5, 2006, officials at the Shanghai’s Tilanqiao Prison took Mr. Zheng Enchong from his cell. and brought him back home.
