URGENT APPEAL - THE OBSERVATORY

Smear campaign / Death threats
Sri Lanka
October 6, 2011
 
The 
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of 
the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and the International Federation 
for Human Rights (FIDH), requests your urgent intervention in the following 
situation.
 
Brief 
description of the situation:
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the false 
allegations and death threats made against Mr. Sunanda Deshapriya, a human rights defender, press freedom campaigner and a journalist 
from Sri Lanka who was the Head of the Free Media Movement before going into 
exile in 2009[1].
 
According to the information received, on September 12, 2011, Mr. 
Sunanda Deshapriya attended a side event at the 18th session of the 
UN Human Rights Council organised by the Sri Lankan Government. H.E. Mohamed 
Nasheed, President of the Maldives, a number of Ministers and senior Government 
officials from Sri Lanka, as well as representatives from a number of diplomatic 
missions in Geneva, from international human rights organisations and some Sri 
Lankan human rights defenders participated in the event.  
 
A few days later, several Sri Lankan media outlets controlled by the 
State or sympathetic to the Sri Lankan Government, including televisions, 
radios, newspapers and websites, published an inaccurate account of the event. 
They falsely claimed that the President of the Maldives accused Mr. Sunanda 
Deshapriya of having 
acted “against his country” by supporting the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) at the 
Human Rights Council and thus betraying his country's interests[2]. 

 
However, according to those who attended the event, these accounts 
were not accurate and they recounted that the Maldivian President had in fact 
engaged in a cordial conversation with Mr. Sunanda Deshapriya and other Sri 
Lankan human rights defenders after the meeting. Furthermore, on September 27, 
the President of the Maldives made a statement in which he expressed his good 
wishes to all Tamil people and his desire for all people to live peacefully 
together[3].
 
Since these false allegations were made in the media, Mr. Sunanda 
Deshapriya has been receiving death threats through phone calls from hidden 
numbers and comments made in on line media. The Observatory recalls that Mr. 
Deshapriya has already been subjected to smear campaigns in the past. In May 
2009, following his participation and oral intervention during the 
11th Special Session on Sri Lanka at the UN Human Rights Council, he 
was also subjected to threats, forcing him to go into 
exile.
 
The Observatory expresses its deep concern about those false 
allegations and threats against Mr. Sunanda Deshapriya, and in particular fears for the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Deshapriya’s 
family who remains in Sri Lanka. 
 
The Observatory further fears that this campaign of defamation 
against Mr. Deshapriya is not only carried out in retaliation of his human 
rights activities but also aims at deterring other human rights defenders from 
engaging with UN mechanisms and participating in sessions of the UN Human Rights 
Council and therefore hinder them from carrying out their legitimate human 
rights work. 
 
Actions requested:
 
Please write to the authorities of Sri Lanka urging them to: 

 
i.         
Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological 
integrity of Mr. Sunanda Deshapriya's family who may be exposed, and of all human rights defenders in Sri 
Lanka;
 
ii.       
Put an end to all acts harassment against Mr. Sunanda Deshapriya and, more generally, against all human rights defenders in Sri 
Lanka;
 
iii.      
Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights 
Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 
1998, in particular :
-          its Article 1, which provides that “everyone has the right, 
individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the 
protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the 
national and international levels”, 
-          Article 11, which states that “everyone has the right, individually 
and in association with others, to the lawful exercise of his or her occupation 
or profession”, 
-          Article 12(1) that provides “everyone has the right, individually and 
in association with others, to participate in peaceful activities against 
violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms”, 
-          as well as Article 12.2, which provides that “the State shall take 
all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of 
everyone, individually or in association with others, against any violence, 
threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or 
any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of 
the rights referred to in the present Declaration”; 
 
iv.     Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental 
freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and 
international instruments ratified by Sri Lanka.
