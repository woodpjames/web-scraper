JOINT
STATEMENT
 
Cambodian
and international CSOs condemn removal of banners calling for the release of
human rights defenders #FreeThe5KH #FreeTepVanny
  





9 May 2017
 
We,
the undersigned Cambodian and international civil society organizations,
condemn the removal by district and commune police authorities of banners calling
for the release of six human rights defenders. Banners were removed from the
offices of the Cambodian Human Rights and Development Association (“ADHOC”),
the Cambodian League for the Promotion and Defense of Human Rights (“LICADHO”)
and Mother Nature in Koh Kong’s Smach Meanchey commune on 02 May 2017,[1]
as well as from three residences in Koh Kong province’s Srae Ambel district on
03 May 2017.[2]
 
The
display of banners by the individuals and organizations concerned is a
legitimate exercise of their right to freedom of expression. This right, which
also protects political speech and speech critical of government, may only be
restricted in certain limited circumstances – none of which apply in this case.[3]
The forced removal of banners amounts to an unjustified and thus unlawful
restriction of this internationally and constitutionally protected human right.
 
"It
is clear that tolerance for dissent and peaceful protest in Cambodia is now
virtually non-existent,” said Alex Gonzalez-Davidson, Executive Director of
Mother Nature. “Absurd claims that the banners 'threaten peace and security'
cannot disguise what is nothing more than a heavy-handed attempt by the
increasingly paranoid authorities to intimidate civil society groups."
 
These
actions in both cases occurred on private property and seriously undermine the
rule of law in Cambodia. Article 40 of the Constitution of the Kingdom of
Cambodia stipulates that “the protection of the rights to the inviolability of
residence […] shall be guaranteed. Search of residences, properties […] shall
be done in accordance with the legal stipulations.” The police lacked any
search warrant and the authorities have acknowledged their lack of any legal
basis.[4]
 
This
outrageous attack on free speech illustrates the increased shrinking of
democratic space for civil society in Cambodia, at a time of approaching
commune and national elections, impacting in particular the rights to freedom
of expression, peaceful assembly and freedom of association, which are
guaranteed by the Constitution of the Kingdom of Cambodia, and domestic and
international law.
 
“With
the commune elections less than a month away, the authorities have once again
shown that they will not accept any activities or opinions that do not suit
their political interests,” said Naly Pilorge, LICADHO’s Deputy Director
of Advocacy. “The six human rights defenders have already lost their liberty.
Now even those calling for their release face repression.”
 
These
incidents occurred only a few days after the one-year mark of the detention of
five of the human rights defenders - Lim Mony, Yi Soksan, Ny Sokha, Nay Vanda
and National Election Committee Deputy Secretary General Ny Chakrya - on 28
April 2017; detention that has been found to be ‘arbitrary’ by the UN Working Group
on Arbitrary Detention.[5]
On 27 April 2017, the Phnom Penh Municipal Court decided to extend the five’s
pre-trial detention for up to another six months. The extension of their
detention was criticized once again by local, regional and international civil
society organizations as well as the Delegation of the European Union to
Cambodia[6]
and the United States Department of State,[7]
and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in
Geneva.[8]
The day prior to the Investigating Judge’s decision to extend their detention
for a further six-month period, it was announced that the five were also
collectively selected as one of three finalists for the Martin Ennals Award for
Human Rights Defenders.[9]
 
55
Cambodian and international civil society organizations[10]
have peacefully joined together to campaign for the release of the five human
rights defenders and land rights activist and human rights defender Tep Vanny,
including through banners that count the number of days the six human rights
defenders have spent in detention. The campaign has been widely supported by
the international community and the public, with individuals in Cambodia and
internationally sending photos and supportive messages to show solidarity with
the detainees. 
 
We,
the undersigned Cambodian and international civil society organizations, call
on the Ministry of Interior and other relevant local, provincial and national
authorities to justify the removal of the six banners and, if there are no
valid legal grounds for their removal, to immediately return them to the
individuals and organizations concerned. We also call on the Royal Government
of Cambodia to immediately cease all intimidation, threats and use of the
criminal justice system against those who are peacefully exercising their
rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and association. Most
urgently, we reiterate our call for the Cambodian authorities to release the
five human rights defenders and Tep Vanny immediately and unconditionally, withdraw
all charges and halt any other criminal proceedings against them.
