Brief description of the situation:The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by a reliable source1 about the beating and detention of petitioning unemployed workers in Suining City, Sichuan Province.   According to the information received, this crackdown in Beijing happened in the run-up to China’s October 1st National Day Celebrations. On the morning of September 20, 2006, more than 40 dismissed workers from Suining’s Suizhou Guesthouse went to the office of the Suining Municipal Party Committee to deliver a petition. Around 4 pm, Mr. Wang Yanwen, the deputy director of the Suining Municipal Public Security Bureau (PSB), and Mr. Li Nianguang, the director of the city’s Letters and Petitions Office, arrived with several dozen uniformed and plain-clothed police officers and attempted to forcibly remove the petitioning workers.   According to the same information, police officers reportedly pushed two female workers, Mrs. Zhang Xiaohua and Mrs. Liu Xiaohong, to the ground. Mrs. Zhang Xiaohua was badly beaten, and suffered from serious head injuries and nausea as a result. The two women were subsequently taken to the local hospital, where Mrs. Zhang Xiaohua was diagnosed with a cerebral concussion. The Party Committee head reportedly instructed the hospital not to treat the women, but they were admitted nevertheless. Furthermore, the police forcibly detained two other female petitioners, Mrs. Wang Jun and Mrs. Xu Haiyan, as they were returning home after the petitioning attempt. In addition, a male worker, Mr. Huang Zhuyu, was detained by local police after he returned home that evening. The police authorities are still on the lookout for a number of other petitioners, who have not returned home for fear of being detained or harassed.  The workers had been dismissed after the Suizhou Guesthouse went bankrupt and its assets were sold to the benefit of a single bidder. Further, several audits had reportedly found evidence of corruption by the general manager of the guesthouse, Mr. Xie Zhicheng, who is now the deputy secretary general of the Suining Municipal Government. After most of the guesthouse’s workers were laid off, they repeatedly petitioned the municipal government and Party Committee, requesting assistance in obtaining unemployment benefits, however officials reportedly used stalling tactics, leaving the workers with no option but to continue petitioning.  The International Secretariat of OMCT expresses its deep concern about these events and the reports of a large-scale round-up of hundreds of petitioners in Beijing. In addition to calling for the release of  Mrs Wang Jun, Mrs Xu Haiyan and M Huang Zhuyu, it also deplores the brutal treatment of these laid-off workers, who were only exercising their lawful right to petition following the failure of local authorities to provide unemployment benefits. Furthermore, the International Secretariat of OMCT urges authorities to conform with China’s international human rights obligations, commitments that were reaffirmed on the occasion of its election as a member of the new United Nations Human Rights Council.  Action requested:Please write to the authorities in the People’s Republic of China urging them to: i.	Guarantee, in all circumstances, the physical and psychological integrity of Mrs. Zhang Xiaohua, Mrs. Liu Xiaohong, Mrs. Wang Jun, Mrs. Xu Haiyan and Mr. Huang Zhuyu;  	ii. 	Order the immediate release of Mrs. Wang Jun, Mrs. Xu Haiyan and Mr.Huang Zhuyu in the  		absence of valid charges, or, if such charges exist, bring them before an impartial and competent  		tribunal and guarantee their procedural rights at all times;  	iii.      Order a thorough and impartial investigation into these events, in order to identify all those           		responsible, bring them to trial and apply the penal and/or administrative sanctions as provided 		by law;  		iv.      Guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in 	            accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
