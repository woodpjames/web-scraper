The perpetrators of these crimes must be arrested and brought to justice, in accordance with international human rights standards.  According to OMCT’s Director, Eric Sottas, “ these barbaric acts tarnish the cause which they claim to serve, from the moment they stop respecting the fundamental protection of the right to life, a value proclaimed by every international convention, as well as by national laws and all religions. It is unacceptable to take the lives of civilians as a means of pressure.”  OMCT expresses its condolences to the victims of the bombings and their families.    Contact OMCT : 	+41 22 809.49.39
