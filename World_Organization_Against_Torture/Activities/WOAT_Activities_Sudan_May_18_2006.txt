Brief description of the situation:The Observatory has been informed by the Sudan Organisation Against Torture (SOAT) about the incommunicado detention of Mr. Mossaad Mohamed Ali and Mr. Adam Mohammed Sharief, two human rights defenders in Nyala, Southern Darfur.  According to the information received, on May 15, 2006, at 09.30 am, officers from the National Security Bureau (NSB) in Nyala, Southern Darfur, summoned for questioning Mr. Mossaad Mohamed Ali, lawyer and Coordinator of the Amel Centre for Treatment and Rehabilitation of Victims of Torture in Nyala, and Mr. Adam Mohammed Sharief, member of the Amel Network of Lawyers in Nyala.  Mr. Ali and Mr. Sharief were then detained for thirteen hours in a cell in the NSB offices in Nyala, before being released at 10 pm. During the period of their detention, both men were neither questioned nor charged with an offence.   On May 16, 2006, in the early morning, Mr. Ali and Mr. Sharief were again summoned to the security offices, where they remain in detention up to now. Mr. Ali and Mr. Sharief were denied access to their family and to legal counsel. Security officers also denied the United Nations Mission in Sudan (UNMIS) access to Mr. Ali and Mr. Sharief. No reason was given for the summoning and the subsequent arrest and incommunicado detention of Mr. Ali and Mr. Sharief.  The Observatory strongly condemns the incommunicado detentions of Mr. Mossaad Mohamed Ali and Mr. Adam Mohammed Sharief, which take place in a context of recurrent harassment and repression of human rights defenders in Southern Darfur (See 2005 Annual Report of the Observatory). The Observatory further expresses its deep concern about the health and physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Mossaad Mohamed Ali and Mr. Adam Mohammed Sharief, and fears that they may be subjected to torture and ill treatment. Action requested:Please write to the authorities of Sudan urging them to: i.	guarantee under all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Mossaad Mohamed Ali and Mr. Adam Mohammed Sharief, and in particular ensure that they be not subjected to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment during their detention;  ii.	release Mr. Mossaad Mohamed Ali and Mr. Adam Mohammed Sharief immediately and unconditionally in the absence of any valid charges against them, or in the case of valid charges against them, bring them before an impartial tribunal without delay and guarantee procedural rights at all times, ensuring, among others, that they have access to legal advice;  iii.	put an end to all acts of harassment against human rights defenders in Sudan;  iv.	conform with the provisions of the Declaration on Humans Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, in particular article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually or in association with others, to promote the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, and article 12.2, which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually or in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”;  v.	more generally, ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in Sudan in accordance with international human rights standards.  •	Addresses:His Excellency Lieutenant General Omar Hassan al-Bashir, President of the Republic of Sudan, Presidential Palace, PO Box 281, Khartoum, Sudan, Fax: +249 183 783 223  Mr. Al Zubeir Beshir Taha, Minister of Interior, PO Box 873, Khartoum, Sudan, Fax: + 249 183 779383 Mr. Mustafa Lam Akol Ajawin, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, PO Box 873, Khartoum, Sudan, fax : + 249 183 779 383 Dr. Abdelmuneim Osman Mohamed Taha, Rapporteur, Advisory Council for Human Rights, PO Box 302, Khartoum (Sudan), Fax No.: + 249 183 77 08 83 His Excellency Salva Kiir Mayardit, First Vice-President, People’s Palace, PO Box 281, Khartoum, Sudan, Fax: + 249 183 771025 His Excellency Ali Osman Mohamed Taha, Vice-President, People’s Palace, PO Box 281, Khartoum, Sudan, Fax: + 249 183 771025 Dr. Abdelmuneim Osman Mohamed Taha, Advisory Council for Human Rights, PO Box 302, Khartoum, Sudan, Fax: + 249 183 77088 Mr. Ali Mohamed Osman Yassin, Minister of Justice and Attorney General, Ministry of Justice, Khartoum, Sudan, Fax: + 249 183 788 941 His Excellence Ambassador Mr. Mohamed Elhassan Ahmed Elhaj, Permanent Mission of the Republic of Sudan to the United Nations in Geneva, Avenue Blanc 47, 1202 Geneva, PO Box 335, 1211 Geneva 19, Switzerland, Fax: +41 22 731 26 56, Email: mission.sudan@bluewin.ch; mission.sudan@ties.itu.int.
