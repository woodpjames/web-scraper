New information:  The Observatory has been informed by Human Rights in China (HRIC), that Mrs. Ding Zilin, Mrs. Zhang Xianling and Mrs. Yin Min, members of the Tiananmen Mothers, are being held under  house arrest.   According to the information received, Mrs. Ding Zilin, Mrs. Zhang Xianling and Mrs. Yin Min were planning to file a legal complaint before the Supreme People's Procuratorate against former Premier Li Peng on behalf of 126 people who lost a family member in the violent crackdown against protesters in Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989.  According to the information received, on May 24, a senior official visited Ding Zilin and her husband, Jiang Peijun, to inform them that a resolution concerning the violent crackdown by the People's Liberation Army soldiers against protesters in Beijing on June 4, 1989 was out of the question. Following this visit, no one has been allowed to enter Ding and Jiang’s home. The couple has also not been allowed to leave home except for the purchase of basic necessities. On May 25, police warned Ding Zilin not to go to the Procuratorate.   On May 28, Zhang Xianling and Yin Min were also placed under surveillance. The police warned them not to file any legal complaints. Following this police warning, the three women issued an open letter demanding accountability for the violent crackdown on peaceful protesters 15 years ago and calling on Chinese people to put pressure on the Chinese government to take up genuine reform.  The Observatory urges the Chinese authorities to conform with the provisions of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 9, 1998, which states in article 9.2 that “everyone whose rights or freedoms are allegedly violated has the right, either in person or through legally authorized representation, to complain to and have that complaint promptly reviewed in a public hearing before an independent, impartial and competent judicial or other authority established by law and to obtain from such an authority a decision, in accordance with law, providing redress, including any compensation due, where there has been a violation of that person's rights or freedoms, as well as enforcement of the eventual decision and award, all without undue delay”.  Background information:  The “Tiananmen Mothers” is a group of family members of people killed or injured in the violent crackdown on peaceful protesters in Tiananmen Square in June 1989, when the Chinese authorities sent armed troops into Beijing to suppress a peaceful movement calling for democratic reform and an end to corruption. Over the past 15 years, the Tiananmen Mothers have documented the cases of 182 people killed during the crackdown in Beijing, and have been calling upon the Chinese government to make appropriate reparations.   On March 28, 2004, Mrs. Ding Zilin, head of the Tiananmen Mothers, and two members, Mrs. Zhang Xianling and Mrs. Huang Jinping, were arrested and their homes searched by the police. Mrs. Ding Zilin lost her son in the events of 1989 and since then has become the most prominent spokesperson for victims' families in revealing the truth and demanding justice. Mrs. Zhang Xianling and Mrs. Huang Jinping also lost their son and husband, respectively, and are well-known spokespersons of the “Tiananmen Mothers”. Their arrest occurred after a video CD was released in Hong Kong, presenting the testimonies of six family members of the June 4th victims, including the testimonies of Ding Zilin, Zhang Xianling and Huang Jinping. This video CD was taken to Geneva to be presented to the Human Rights Commission’s Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances. The three of them were released on April 1, 2004.
