URGENT APPEAL - THE OBSERVATORY

Arbitrary arrest 
Turkey
September 25, 2012
 
The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of
the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation
Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent intervention in the following
situation in Turkey.
 
Description of the situation:
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources
about the arbitrary arrest of Mr. Ali Tanrıverdi, Chairperson of the
Mersin Branch of the Human Rights Association (İnsan
Haklari Derneği – İHD).
 
According to the
information received, in the early morning of September 25, 2012, police teams
of Mersin Security Directorate carried out simultaneous raids in the province
of Mersin, in the scope of operations targeting the Kurdish Communities Union
(KCK) – an organisation said to be the “urban branch” of the armed Kurdistan
Workers Party (PKK). These operations
resulted in the arrest of at least 42 people, including Mr. Ali Tanrıverdi
together with journalists and members of Kurdish political party Peace and
Democracy Party (BDP). Mr. Ali Tanrıverdi's house was raided while the office
of İHD was simultaneously searched for four hours and electronic devices were
seized, without any legal document being produced and while the executives of
the organisation were not present. Mr. Tanrıverdi was reportedly not allowed to
call his lawyer during the raid on his house, and he and other detainees were
informed that they would not be authorised to consult their lawyers during 24
hours.
 
The Observatory recalls that this new wave of arbitrary arrests and
detentions is part of a wide-range anti-terrorist operation, initiated in 2009
and intended to dismantle the KCK as an alleged terrorist network, while this
campaign has in fact been targeting dozens of peaceful activists who have been
involved in advocating for a peaceful resolution of the Kurdish issue and are
not related to any terrorist activities, including human rights defenders in
Turkey, particularly İHD members, members of trade unions, lawyers and
journalists. 
 
The Observatory recalls that 12 other İHD members are
currently in pre-trial detention pending the outcome of trials on spurious
terrorism-related charges: Messrs. Muharrem Erbey and Arslan Özdemir,
Diyarbakır Branch Executives; Messrs. Şerif Süren and Orhan Çiçek,
Aydın Branch Executives; Mr. Reşit Teymur, Siirt Branch Executive; Mr. Abdulkadir
Çurğatay and Ms. Veysi Parıltı, Mardin Branch Executives;
Doğubeyazıt Representative Şaziye Önder; Mr. Mensur Işık Muş,
former Branch Chairperson; Mr. Hikmet Kapancı, Malatya Executive;
Mr. Bekir Gürbüz, Adıyaman Branch former Chairperson and Mr. Osman
Işçi, former staff of the General Centre. 
 
Accordingly, the Observatory calls upon the Turkish
authorities to put an end to the continuing harassment against human rights
defenders and urges the Turkish authorities to release all human rights
defenders currently held in detention immediately and
unconditionally, since their detention is arbitrary as it only aim at
sanctioning their human rights activities.
 
Actions requested:
 
i. Guarantee in all circumstances the physical
and psychological integrity of Messrs.
Ali Tanrıverdi, as well as that of all
human
rights defenders in Turkey;
 
ii. Release immediately and unconditionally Messrs. Ali Tanrıverdi, as well as all human
rights defenders since their detention is arbitrary as it only aim at
sanctioning their human rights activities;
 
iii. Put an end to all acts harassment,

i. Comply with the provisions of the United Nations
Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, especially its Article 1, which states

promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and
fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, as well as
Article 12.2, which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures
to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually
and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de
facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action
as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in
the present Declaration” ;
 
ii. More generally, ensure in all circumstances the
respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with
international and regional human rights instruments ratified by Turkey.
