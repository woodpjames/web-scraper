Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Liga Mexicana por la Defensa de los Derechos Humanos (LIMEDDH), a member of the OMCT network, of the excessive use of force by the riot police and the Mexican Preventive Federal Police against numerous demonstrators in Quintana Roo, Cancun, Mexico.  Following these events 70 people were detained and dozens were hurt, some by firearms, women were ill-treated, and several persons intoxicated with tear gas.  According to the information received, on December 9th, 2001 between 8h00 and 9h00, several members of the Asociación de Chiapanecos Residentes en Quintana Roo (ACHIRQROO), peacefully demonstrated and closed down the Cancun– Chetumal highway.   The demonstrators were demanding to negotiate with the Mayor Miguel Ramon Martin Aueta, so that they could be allowed access to the Rancho known as “Los Gavilanes” that they owned, and that they had been evicted from by members of the public security police, who continued to guard its entrance.   According to the report, even though the demonstrators requested the Mayor’s presence, he never came, and the riot police and the Preventive Federal Police proceeded to evict them arbitrarily and violently, without any legal warrant.  They attacked women and men who were protesting, causing confrontations that because of the police’s use of firearms, tear gas, and toletes (clubs), resulted in several wounded, including children and women.  Some persons were reportedly kicked, beaten, and ill-treated, after their arrest and transfer, when they were already detained and handcuffed, and some women were allegedly pulled by the hair, sexually molested, and threatened with rape.  Some demonstrators declared they had their cash and personal effects stolen.    According to the report, around 70 people were detained, among them 16 women, and two minors (17-year old Jorge Servin De la Cruz, and 15-year old José Luis Rodríguez Gómez).  12 demonstrators reportedly disappeared.
