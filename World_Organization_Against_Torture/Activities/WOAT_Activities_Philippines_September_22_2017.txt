Item 6- UPR Outcomes: Philippines
Oral Statement to be delivered by the World Organization Against Torture
(OMCT)
Thank you Mr. President,
World Organization Against Torture
(OMCT)welcomes the report of the Working
Group on the UPR of the Philippines, and would like to thank all Member States that
have relayed the concerns of civil society organizations.
We indeed reiterate our deep
concerned about the Philippines rejection of recommendations related to the extrajudicial
killings committed under the so-called “War on Drugs”, and the Government's
refusal to engage in a meaningful dialogue on the subject.
Between President Rodrigo Duterte’s
election in June 2016 and April 2017, OMCT and local partners have
documented at least 40 cases of extrajudicial killings of children in Manila
area, Regrettably, these numbers only continue to rise today. 
We have also observed
a significant increase in the number of children arbitrarily detained and
tortured, since Mr. Duterte was elected. In addition, our office continues to
receive information about human rights defenders who have been persecuted and
threatened by the current Duterte Administration.
We urge the Philippines to fully
engage in a dialogue with the international community and civil society – as
dialogue is the only way to bring its national policies inline with international
standards and ensure accountability for the crimes committed. 
In conclusion, we cannot more firmly
urge the Filipino Government to immediately stop persecuting human rights
defenders and instead start protecting all children, irrespectively of their social
status or alleged involvement in drug trafficking.
Thank you Mr. President
