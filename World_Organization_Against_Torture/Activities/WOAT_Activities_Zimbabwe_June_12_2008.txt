Description of the situation: The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources, including the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC), about acts of harassment against the Progressive Teachers’ Union of Zimbabwe (PTUZ) by members of the Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF), in Gokwe. According to the information received, on June 6, 2008, Mr. Tinarwo, a PTUZ member, was abducted and seriously assaulted at the Gokwe Centre and held captive for more than nine hours. On June 7, 2008, a group of about 15 people, mainly ZANU-PF members and war veterans, severely beat up Mr. Moses Mhaka, PTUZ Coordinator for Gokwe. They took away his identity document and other personal documents. He and the PTUZ were accused of being responsible for the defeat of the ZANU PF party in and around the Gokwe region. Finally, on June 9, 2008, at about 8.45 am, the same group of people stormed into the Gokwe offices of the PTUZ, ransacked the office, grabbed a number of documents that they took away with them, and ordered that the union ceases its business. They also forced the PTUZ secretary to lock the offices. The Observatory expresses its deep concern about the above-mentioned acts of harassment against the PTUZ, in a context of increasing repression against all persons who have been involved in the human rights monitoring of the March 2008 election process. The Observatory further recalls that according to Article 1 of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”. Actions required: Please write to the authorities of Zimbabwe urging them to:   Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Messrs. Tinarwo and Moses Mhaka, all PTUZ members as well as of all human rights defenders in Zimbabwe;  Conduct a fair and impartial investigation into the above-mentioned events in order to identify all those responsible, bring them before a competent and impartial tribunal and apply to them the penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions provided by the law;  Guarantee in all circumstances that PTUZ and all human rights defenders in Zimbabwe be able to carry out their work without any hindrance;  Put an end to all kinds of harassment against all human rights defenders in Zimbabwe;  Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its above-mentioned Article 1 and article 12.2, which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the [...] Declaration”;  Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by Zimbabwe.
