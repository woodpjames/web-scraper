Judicial harassment

The Observatory for the Protection of Human
Rights Defenders, a partnership of FIDH and the World Organisation Against
Torture (OMCT), has received new information and requests your urgent
intervention in the following situation in Turkey. 
 
New
information:
 
The
Observatory has been informed by its trial observers about yesterday's
developments in the trial against Mr. Levent Pişkin, a human rights lawyer belonging to the
Association of Lawyers for Freedom (Ozgurlukcu
Hukukcular Dernegi – OHD),
a Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transsexual and Intersexed (LGBTI) rights activist,
and a member of the Justice Commission of the Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP)[1]. 
                
According to the information received, during the
May-18 hearing which was monitored by an Observatory trial observation mission,
the Heavy Penal Court in Bursa heard the case against Mr. Levent Pişkin on
charges of “undermining the image of Turkey” and “support to a terrorist group”
(Article 7 of the Anti-Terror Law – ATL and Article 314 of the Turkish Penal
Code). The defendant is criminalised for fulfilling his duties as an attorney,
in particular for being part of the lawyers team of HDP co-chair Mr. Selahattin
Demirtaş (see background information).
 
During the May-18
hearing, the accusation upheld the argument of the investigators, who had
considered during the pre-trial stage that a meeting between Mr. Demirtaş'
lawyers, where they had decided to share the costs of their dinner, was
amounting to “financial support to terrorism”.
 
The accusation went on
alleging that interviews given by Mr. Pişkin to international media, notably Der
Spiegel, had contributed to “undermining the image of Turkey”.
 
In turn, Mr. Levent
Pişkin's lawyers demonstrated that the investigations against the defendant
violated the principles of the due process and rule of law, in particular in
terms of fairness and impartiality, relying on provisions of the European
Convention of Human Rights (ECHR) and on relevant case-law from the European
Court of Human Rights (ECtHR). Several activists were present in the courtroom
in a sign of support to Mr. Pişkin.
 
The
next hearing was set for November 30, 2017. Mr. Pişkin remains free but under
judicial supervision.
 
The
Observatory deplores the continuing judicial harassment against Mr. Levent
Pişkin, which seems to merely aim at sanctioning his human rights activities as
an attorney. The Observatory urges the Turkish authorities to drop all the
charges against Mr. Levent Pişkin and to put an end to any kind
of harassment against him.
 
Background information:
 
On November 14, 2016, at
5:30 a.m. the police raided in Mr. Levent Pişkin’s apartment, confiscated some
of his belongings, including his computer and phone, and arrested him.[2]
The Public Prosecution Office ordered his placement in custody and he was
transferred to Bursa Detention Centre. 
 
The arrest would be
related to his visit to his client, Member of Parliament, Mr. Selahattin Demirtaş,
HDP co-Chair, detained since November 4, 2016. Some media accused him of
conveying  Mr. Selahattin Demirtaş’s
message to a German Magazine which could be used as propaganda. 
 
At the day of his arrest,
he was supposed to defend 46 lawyers,  facing
judicial harassment since 2011 for exercising their profession. 
 
In April 2017, almost six months after his
arrest, Mr. Levent Pişkin was charged for fulfilling his duties as an attorney. The Bursa Chief Public Prosecutor Gökhan Şen
indeed accused Mr. Pişkin of “using his attorney ID to visit his client
Selahattin Demirtaş, who is currently jailed in Edirne Penitentiary, and
accepting [his fellow attorney Cahit] Kırkazak’s proposal to deliver a message
from Mr. Demirtaş to the German magazine Der Spiegel, in order to bring
the arrest of Mr. Demirtaş to the international agenda and into lobbying
efforts on the international stage”.
 
Specifically, the prosecution claimed that many
stories published in Der Spiegel “contain insults to the Turkish
state and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, spread unfounded news that insults,
teases and belittles the country, and pursues an editorial policy that stokes
public opinion against the country in order to discredit the nation on the
international stage”.
 
The indictment further referred to Mr. Levent
Pişkin’s phone call with fellow attorney Cahit Kırkazak, who was taken into
custody in the same investigation as him, as a “phone communication within
the organisational hierarchy”, and Mr. Pişkin’s membership in a WhatsApp group
named “HDPIstanbul” was also included in his list of crimes.

defenders in Turkey;
 
ii. Put an end to all forms of harassment, including at
judicial level, against Mr. Levent Pişkin, as well as other human rights defenders in Turkey, and in particular lawyers, since it only seems to aim
