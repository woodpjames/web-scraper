The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of
the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation
Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent intervention in the following
situation in Turkey.
 
Description of the situation:
 
The
Observatory has been informed by reliable sources of the ongoing judicial
harassment faced by Mr. Ramazan Demir, a lawyer known for his
participation in the defence of journalists prosecuted within the framework of
a broad-ranging anti-terrorist operation intended to dismantle an alleged
terrorist network known as KCK[1], and more particularly the
“KCK Press Trial”, but also his mobilisation in favour of lawyers prosecuted
under two mass anti-terrorism trials[2].
 
According
to the information received, Mr. Ramazan Demir is facing charges in relation to
defence speeches made during KCK trials. On July 16, 2013, he was charged for
“insulting or (…) offending the dignity of a public authority in the
performance of his duties”, pursuant to Section 125 of the Criminal Code which
provides for up to two years of imprisonment. According to Articles 58 and 59
of the Law on Attorneyship (Law No. 1136 adopted on March 19, 1966), a lawyer
may be charged only upon the authorisation of the Criminal Affairs Department
of the Justice Ministry. 
 
The
charges follow a complaint filed on May 13, 2013 by the Special Prosecutor of
the 15th Heavy Criminal Court, after, during a hearing held on
November 16, 2012, Mr. Demir challenged the capacity of the Prosecutor to
determine in the indictment that a group of journalists facing charges were
conducting activities that are not “normal” nor “independent”. Mr. Demir also
requested the court to call and hear an expert to testify before the Court on
what can constitute normal and independent journalistic activities. The Silivri
Prosecutor conducted an investigation, decided to charge lawyer Ramazan Demir
and, on September 9, 2013, obtained authorisation from the Justice Ministry to
file the indictment. 
 
On
November 7, 2013, the Istanbul Bar Association also initiated a disciplinary
investigation against Mr. Ramazan Demir in relation to the same incident
pursuant to Article 141 of the Internal Rules on Attorneyship, following the
complaint filed by the Special Prosecutor of the 15th Heavy Criminal Court. Mr.
Demir may face an official warning, a fine, suspension from the exercise of
attorneyship or may even be disbarred. 
 
According
to the same information, this case of harassment of lawyers is not unique.
Several other lawyers would be facing the same charges for defence speeches
made in KCK trials.
 
The Observatory is deeply concerned
by this new pattern of judicial harassment facing lawyers in Turkey, as
it seems to merely aim at curtailing the legitimate exercise of their profession and their
peaceful efforts towards the defence of human rights principles, and calls upon
the Turkish judicial authorities to unconditionally drop the charges against
Mr. Ramazan Demir. 
 
The Observatory further
recalls that dozens of human rights defenders are currently subjected to
prolonged judicial harassment for trumped-up and abusive terrorism charges in
Turkey. The KCK Press Trial is one of dozens of ongoing mass trials of Kurdish
intellectuals and activists in Turkey. Since 2009, over 8,000 people have been
arrested in the context of the KCK investigations - counter-terrorism
operations that in reality have little to do with countering terrorism, but
rather have been used as a means of criminalising peaceful dissent and Kurdish
political and cultural expression. 
 
Actions
required:
 
Please write to
the Turkish authorities, urging them to:
 
i. Guarantee in
all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Ramazan Demir
as well as all human rights defenders in Turkey;
 
ii. Drop charges pending against Mr. Ramazan Demir immediately
and unconditionally as the charges are clearly aimed at curtailing the
legitimate exercise of their professions and their peaceful human rights
activities;
 
iii.
Put an end to all acts of harassment, including at the judicial level, against
Mr. Ramazan Demir and ensure in
all circumstances that human rights defenders in
Turkey are able to carry out their work without
unjustified hindrances;
 
iv. Comply with
the provisions of the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted
by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its Article 1,
which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with
others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human
rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, as
well as Article 12.2, which provides that “the State shall take all necessary
measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone,
individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats,
retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other
arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the
rights referred to in the present Declaration”;
 
v. More
generally, ensure in all circumstances the respect for human rights and
fundamental freedoms in accordance with international and regional human rights
instruments ratified by Turkey.
