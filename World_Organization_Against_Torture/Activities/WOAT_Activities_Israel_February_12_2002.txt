Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by Al-Haq, a member of the network of OMCT that, on 8 February 2002, Samer Ziad Sliman Abu Mayala (14), from Jerusalem was shot and killed by the Israeli police.  According to the information provided to Al-Haq by witnesses of the incident, Samer Ziad Sliman Abu Mayala was one of four suspects chased by the police after an Israeli woman was stabbed and killed near the Jabal Al-Muqaber area of Jerusalem. It was reported that the Israeli police arrived at the scene of the stabbing just after it occurred, and began to chase the boys suspected of involvement in the attack, including 14-year-old Abu Mayala. The witnesses also reported hearing shooting, and one reported that he saw Abu Mayala fall to the ground.  After the incident the police released a statement saying that Abu Mayala died of heart failure after he was taken into custody, and the hospital where he was initially admitted reported that there were no signs of physical violence on his body. His family was unconvinced by the reports of the police, and therefore asked that an autopsy be performed. An examination was carried out by the heads of the Israeli Autopsy Center and the Palestinian Autopsy Center on 10 February 2002.  An examination of Abu Mayala’s internal organs indicated that he had been shot. His liver was fragmented and a bullet path was traced from his liver towards his heart. Using x-rays the doctors were able to locate the bullet in the boy’s abdomen. A hole was found in the left side of Abu Mayala’s underpants, and examination of his buttocks showed that the bullet had entered him from the lower left side of his buttocks. The autopsy results indicate that the boy was shot at a distance of 30 cm to one metre.  The International Secretariat of OMCT is deeply concerned about the killing of 14-year-old Samer Ziad Sliman Abu Mayala. OMCT deems that this incident constitutes a violation of article 6 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), which enshrines the child’s right to life.  Action requested  Please write to the Israeli authorities urging them to: i.	guarantee an immediate investigation into the circumstances of the killing of Samer Ziad Sliman Abu Mayala, identify those responsible, bring them before a civil competent and impartial tribunal and apply the penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions provided by law. ii.	ensure respect of the right to life and physical integrity to all Palestinian children by effectively prohibiting excessive, disproportionate or indiscriminate use of force; iii.	guarantee adequate reparation to the family of Samer Ziad Sliman Abu Mayala; iv.	guarantee the respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards, including the Convention on the Rights of the Child.
