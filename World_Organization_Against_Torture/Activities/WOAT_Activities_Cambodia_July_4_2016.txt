The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a partnership of the
World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and FIDH, has received new
information and requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in
Cambodia.
 
New information:
 
The
Observatory has been informed by reliable sources, including the Cambodian
Center for Human Rights (CCHR) and the Cambodian League for the Promotion and
Defense of Human Rights (LICADHO), about the suspended sentences and subsequent
release of Messrs. Sim Somnang, Tri Sovikea, and San Mala, members of the organisation
Mother Nature, a local environmental group known for its efforts to stop
illegal sand dredging and the construction of a hydropower dam in Koh Kong
Province. (c) Licadho
According to
the information received, on July 1, 2016, Judge Min Meakra of the Koh Kong
Provincial Court convicted Messrs. Try Sovikea, Sun Mala and Sim Samnang with
“threatening to cause destruction, defacement or damage followed by an order”
under Articles 28 and 424 of the Criminal Code. These charges were brought
after the three environmental activists were arrested last year amid an ongoing
campaign to end alleged illegal sand dredging in Koh Kong (see background
information). 
 
Messrs. Try
Sovikea, Sun Mala and Sim Samnang were sentenced to 18 months’ imprisonment and
the payment of a two million riel (about US$500) fine as well as a 100 million
riel (about $25,000) compensation payment to the sand dredging company
Direct Access. The company had
initially brought a criminal complaint against the three[1]. As their
10 months and 15 days' pre-trial detention was considered time served and the
remainder of the sentence was suspended, the three were released in the
afternoon of July 1.
 
Throughout
the trial, little or no evidence of their guilt was presented. The defendants’ legal team told the court that
the only evidence relied on by the prosecution were inconclusive video clips
and witness testimonies from several individuals who were not present at the
scene of the alleged crime. One key prosecution witness who was on site gave a
testimony that contradicted his own earlier written witness statement. In
addition, despite the fact that the three activists were initially charged
under Article 424 of the Criminal Code only, Judge Min
Meakra changed the charges
at the last minute to convict the three as instigators to the principal offence
under Article 28 of the Criminal Code.  Such last-minute change
constitutes a denial of the three activists’ right to prepare an adequate legal
defence, in violation of their right to a fair trial.
 
The
Observatory welcomes the release of Messrs. Try Sovikea, Sun Mala and Sim
Samnang but strongly condemns their conviction and the arbitrary detention and
judicial harassment to which they were subjected, which only aimed at
sanctioning their legitimate human rights activities.
 
The
conviction of activists involved in high-profile cases and their release on
suspended sentences has become an often-used tactic by the Cambodian
authorities to criminalize legitimate activism. Accordingly, the Observatory
calls on the Cambodian authorities to put an end to all acts of judicial harassment
against all human rights defenders in Cambodia.
 
Background information:
 
On August
17, 2015, Messrs. Sim Somnang, Tri Sovikea and San Mala were arrested in Andong
Teuk over their involvement in protests that took place on July 26-28 and August 12, 2015 against
Direct Access, a company registered in Cambodia, which has been accused of
illegally dredging sand in Koh Kong Province and causing extensive damage to the environment and
livelihood of local communities in the region. On August
31 and September 21, 2015, the Koh Kong Provincial Court and the Court of
Appeals in Phnom Penh respectively denied bail to the three defenders.
 
Moreover, Mr. Alejandro
Gonzalez-Davidson, a Spanish citizen and the Director of Mother Nature, was
charged as an accomplice to the same alleged offense, despite living overseas
since he was deported from Cambodia on February 23, 2015[2].

 
Messrs. Sim
Samnang, Tri Sovichea, and Sun Mala were held in pre-trial detention in Koh
Kong provincial prison since their arrest - amounting to 11 days longer than
the legal pre-trial detention limit of 10 months. 
 
Actions requested:
 
Please write to the authorities of Cambodia urging
them to:
 
i. Guarantee, in all circumstances, the physical and
psychological integrity of Messrs. Sim Samnang, Tri Sovichea and Sun Mala, as
well as of all human rights defenders in Cambodia;
 
ii. Put an end to acts of harassment - including at
the judicial level - against Messrs. Sim Samnang, Tri Sovichea, Sun Mala and Alejandro Gonzalez-Davidson,
as well as against all human rights defenders in Cambodia so that they are able to carry out their
work without hindrance or fear of reprisals;
 
iiii. Comply with all the provisions of the UN
Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the United Nations General
Assembly on December 9, 1998, in particular its Articles 1, 12.1 and 12.2;
 
iv.
Guarantee in all circumstances the respect for human rights and fundamental
freedoms in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other
international and regional human rights instruments signed or ratified by the
Kingdom of Cambodia.
