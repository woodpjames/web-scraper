Brief description of the situation: The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources, including the Informal Sector Service Centre (INSEC), about threats and acts of harassment against Ms. Rita Mahato and Ms. Dev Kumari Mahara, two members of the Women’s Rehabilitation Centre (WOREC), in Siraha district, Nepal. According to the information received, Ms. Rita Mahato and Ms. Dev Kumari Mahara have been defending for a couple of years the rights of the women and Dalits, documenting cases of violence against women, and providing various forms of support to victims. While their activities have been regularly obstructed by some members of the Govindapur community (Siraha district), their situation has worsened since April 2007. As a matter of fact, after documenting two cases of rape victims in April and May 2007[1], and helping the victims in accessing justice, notably through the registration of their cases with the police and providing legal and medical support to the victims, Ms. Mahato reportedly started receiving threats of death, rape, kidnapping, shooting and beating by Messrs. Binod Balbar Chaudhary, Ramu Yadv, Kishori Raya and Ram Bharosh Yadav, members of the Govindapur community. A man called Mr. Dinesh Yadav further threatened her by saying that “he ha[d] unleashed a man who w[ould] rape any woman”. Both Mr. Ram Bharosh Yadav and Mr. Dinesh Yadav were identified as perpetrators of cases of rape. Subsequent to WOREC denunciations and reports, the Govindapur community blamed Ms. Rita Mahato for calling the police to arrest a perpetrator involved in one of the cases of rape. Indeed, the community had decided that the case was to be settled in the community itself. Furthermore, on June 2, 2007, around 11:52 pm, WOREC office was attacked by unknown assailants with sharp bricks, while the staff was still working. The attackers could not been identified since it was dark outside. When the staff went out to inspect the situation, they were further volleyed with bricks from all over the area while the attackers fled. The staff was not seriously injured in this attack, but they all felt their lives were being threatened. Subsequently, WOREC contacted the local police, who replied that they were unable to come to WOREC office due to security reasons, but they assured the staff they would come the next morning. The staff then inspected the area for about ten minutes, but they again had stones thrown at them by the attackers. Finally, the main gate of WOREC was dismantled and thrown in the middle of the road by unknown assailants, who were later identified by the community as the perpetrators who raped and beat Nepur Devi Yadav. This incident was registered in the local police station, however no investigation has been opened yet. The Observatory expresses its deep concern about these acts of intimidation and obstacles to the human rights activities of WOREC and urges the Nepalese authorities to guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of its members, in particular of Ms. Rita Mahato and Ms. Dev Kumari Mahara. Background information: Siraha is located in the eastern region of the country and shares a border with India. The population of the district encompasses Madhesi communities and is characterised by a strong presence of “feudalism” and social exploitation of marginalised groups. The upper caste/class controls the district by holding the rights to land, and by dominating the marginalised groups such as women and Dalits. WOREC is involved with various activities in empowering the Dalit communities, such as Musahar, Paswan,  Ram and Sarki, who are marginalised and socially excluded. WOREC has been working in Siraha for the past 4 years with a special focus on Dalit rights and women’s rights. WOREC has been active in documenting cases and providing various forms of support, such as legal support, by registering cases with the local police station and other associated government bodies, providing socio-psycho counseling etc. Actions required: Please write to the Nepalese authorities urging them to:  Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of WOREC members, in particular of Ms. Rita Mahato and Ms. Dev Kumari Mahara; Order a thorough and impartial investigation into the above-mentioned events, in order to identify all those responsible, bring them before a civil competent and impartial tribunal and apply to them the penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions provided by the law; Put an end to any kind of act of harassment and threats against WOREC members as well as against all human rights defenders in the country; Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels” and article 12.2, which states that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”; Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by Nepal.
