The Observatory for
the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the World Organisation
Against Torture (OMCT) and the International Federation for Human Rights
(FIDH), expresses its deepest concern regarding the following situation in Israel
and the Occupied Palestinian Territory.
 
Description of the
situation:
 
The Observatory has
been informed by the Addameer Prisoner Support and Human Rights Association
about the arbitrary detention of Mr. Anas Anise Hussein Barghouthi, a
Palestinian human rights lawyer who defends Palestinian political prisoners
arrested by Israel and the Palestinian Authority. 
 
According to the
information received, on September 15, 2013, at around 7pm, Mr. Anas Barghouthi
was arrested by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF)/ (or Israeli Army) at a
military checkpoint between Bethlehem and Ramallah, where he was blindfolded and handcuffed and then taken to an interrogation
centre in the settlement of Etzion, in the southern West Bank. Reportedly, in
the first thirty-six hours of arrest, Mr. Anas Barghouthi was fed only twice
and was not allowed to shower or change his clothes neither he was given
hygiene products. In addition, his lawyer was not able to have access to his
client during the first week of his detention.
 
On September 17,
2013, Mr. Anas Barghouthi was
presented to the Military Court in Ofer, which decided to extend his detention
without charges until September 22, 2013, when the detention period was
extended again until September 24. 
 
On September 24, 2013, Mr. Anas Barghouthi was finally charged with the offences of “membership in the Palestinian
Front for the Liberation of Palestine”, an organisation banned by Israel, and
“leadership of a committee to organise demonstrations”. Mr. Anas Anise Hussein
Barghouthi denies both charges. A first hearing was held on October 1, 2013,
when the trial was postponed until October 9, 2013. On that day, the trial was
again postponed until October 22 because by the time he was presented to a
judge, and despite the fact that Mr. Anas Barghouthi had been waiting at Ofer
Military Court for several hours, he was informed that the court was closing
and it was too late to hold the hearing. 
 
Meanwhile, Mr. Anas Barghouthi remains detained in Ofer military
complex.
 
The Observatory
strongly denounces the arbitrary detention and judicial harassment of Mr. Anas Barghouthi, which seem to be directly linked
to his human rights activities, and urges the Israeli authorities to release him immediately and unconditionally and to put an end to all acts of
harassment against him.
 
Actions
requested:
 
Please write to the
authorities of Israel, urging them to:
 
i. Guarantee in all circumstances the
physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Anas Anise Hussein Barghouthi as
well as of all human rights defenders in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian
Territory;
 
ii. Release Mr. Anas Barghouthi immediately and unconditionally as his detention
is arbitrary since it only aims at sanctioning his human rights
activities;
 
iii. Put an end
to all acts of harassment - including at the judicial level - against Mr. Anas
Barghouthi, as well as against all human rights defenders and human rights
organisations in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory so that they are
able to carry out their work without unjustified hindrances;
 
iv. Comply
with all the provisions of the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights
Defenders, adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 9, 1998, in
particular: 
-      
its
Article 1, which provides that “everyone has the right, individually and in
association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and
realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and
international levels”, 
-      
its
Article 12.2, which states that “the State shall take all necessary measures to
ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually
and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de
facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other
arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the
rights referred to in the present Declaration”;
 
v. More generally, ensure in all circumstances the
respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with international human rights
instruments ratified by Israel.
