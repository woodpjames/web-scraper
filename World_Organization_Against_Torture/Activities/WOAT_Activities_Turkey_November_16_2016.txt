Provisional release/
Judicial harassment
Turkey
November 16, 2016
 
The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a partnership of FIDH
and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), has received new information
and requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in Turkey.

 
New
information:
 
The
Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the provisional release
of Mr. Levent Pişkin, a human rights lawyer member of the Association of
Lawyers for Freedom (Ozgurlukcu Hukukcular Dernegi – OHD), Lesbian, Gay,
Bisexual, transexual and intersex (LGBTI) rights activist and member of the
Justice Commission of the Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP)[1].               According
to the information received, on November 16, 2016, Mr. Levent Pişkin was
provisionally released pending the end of the investigation, after two days of
detention. At the time of the urgent appeal, no formal charges have been yet
brought against him. 
 
The
Observatory welcomes the provisional release of Mr. Levent Pişkin but deplores
the ongoing judicial harassment against him, as well as against human rights
defenders in Turkey. 
 
The
Observatory calls upon the Turkish authorities to put an end to the judicial
proceedings against him and all other human rights defenders, in particular
lawyers, since it only seems to aim at sanctioning legitimate
human rights work.
 
Background
information:
 
Over the past years, Mr. Levent Pişkin has been
suffering constant harassment.In March 2014, he was sued by President Erdogan
and sentenced by the Istanbul’s 14th Criminal Court to pay 10 thousand
liras (around $3,700) in damages for “insult, slander or heavy provocation of a
public official for their public service”. He reacted to a speech by Mr.
Erdogan, Prime minister at the time, who said that “if Alevilik is about
loving Ali, I’m a perfect Alevi”, and tweeted “Waiting for PM to declare, ‘I am
a perfect fag’. Obviously I will not learn how to be a fag from you.
Kisses.#AnayasadaLGBT [LGBT in the Constitution ]”. 
 
In 2016, a bomb, allegedly planted by nationalists
exploded in his garden. On November 14, 2016, at
5:30 a.m. the police raided in Levent Pişkin’s appartment, confiscated some of
his belongings, including his computer and phone, and arrested him. The Public Prosecution Office ordered his
placement in custody and he was transferred to Bursa Detention Centre. 
 
The arrest would be
related to his visit to his client, Member of Parliament. Selahattin Demirtaş,
HDP co-Chair, detained since November 4, 2016. Some media accused him of
conveying Mr. Selahattin Demirtaş’s message to a German Magazine which could be
used as propaganda. 
 
The day of his arrest, he
was supposed to participate in the defense of 46 lawyers facing judicial
harassment since 2011 for exercising their profession[2].

 
The Observatory draws the attention of the Turkish
authorities on the Principle of the United Nations Basic Principles on the Role
of Lawyers, in particular Principles 16, 18, and 20 on Guarantees for the
functioning of lawyers, and Principle 23 on Freedom of expression and
association.
