Description of the situation:  The Observatory has been informed by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) of the arrest of two trade union leaders, as well as of police raids on the offices of the Korean Government Employees Union (KGEU).  According to the information received, Mr. Ahn Byeong-Soon, KGEU General Secretary, was arrested on March 15, 2005, and on March 17, 2005, the courts allowed for his continued detention. Mr. Ahn is reportedly imprisoned in Seoul Prison. The police also arrested Mr. Kim Young-Gil, KGEU President, on April 8, 2005. According to KGEU, it is to be feared that he will be detained and imprisoned for several months. As of the time of writing, the Observatory has not been informed of the charges held against the two men.  The Observatory notes that their arrest takes place in the context of a general crackdown on KGEU, which is considered as an illegal union, as it is illegal to organise for civil servants in South Korea.  Mr. Ahn Byeong-Soon and Mr. Kim Young-Gil were arrested after an arrest warrant was issued against them on November 9, 2004, in relation with a general strike in opposition to the Bill on the Public Officials’ Trade Union Act that took place in November 2004. At the time, the government of Korea attempted to prevent nation-wide rallies organised by the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU) and KGEU in protest of this Bill (See background information). Riot police have surrounded and monitored the KGEU office building since November 2004 and have prevented almost every event of KGEU. The arrests warrants against Mr. Ahn Byeong-Soon and Mr. Kim Young-Gil were pending ever since.  Furthermore, according to the information received, the Ministry of Government Administration and Home Affairs (MOGAHA) has started at the end of 2004 a “New Wind Campaign” targeting KGEU and promoting a “reformation of organisational culture, focusing on rearing workplace councils and healthy employee groups”.    Background information:  At a press conference on September 8, 2004, the Minister of Government Administration and Home Affairs (MOGAHA), Mr. Huh Sung Kwan, announced that all rallies and demonstrations would be banned, and organisers and participants charged with criminal acts. The Minister also announced that he might withhold subsidies from local government authorities negotiating collective agreements with the KGEU, and that the ministry would prevent KGEU from creating a “struggle fund”, and prosecute the organisers the fund. He further issued directives on September 9 and 13, 2004, prohibiting government departments from permitting the collection of union solidarity funds and the collection of union fees for the KGEU on the grounds that it is an illegal organisation (See Observatory Annual Report 2004).  While the KGEU was holding a rally on October 9 and 10, 2004, in order to mobilise opposition to the proposed Bill on the Establishment and Operation of Public Officials’ Trade Unions, the police responded violently, and ten union members were injured. Another 40 members were arbitrarily detained for 20 hours. On October 19, 2004, the government held a ministerial meeting to deliberate and confirm the Bill, and decided to submit it to the National Assembly. The Bill was passed on December 31, 2004, and is due to take effect in 2006. It proposes that the Act will be enacted as the special law under the Trade Unions and Labour Relations Adjustment Act and contains provisions restricting trade unions’ rights.
