More than 80 human rights NGOs from Europe, America, Oceania, Africa 
and Asia will contact this week the Spanish embassies in their respective 
countries in order to denounce the undue sentence of the judge Baltasar Garzón 
and the serious violation of the independence of the judiciary brought about by 
three criminal proceedings implemented agaisnt him. They will also hand over a 
letter (below) urging the Spanish government and the judiciary to guarantee the 
independence and impartiality of justice.
OPEN LETTER TO THE GOVERNMENT AND THE JUDICIARY OF 
SPAIN
 
 
We, the undersigned Human Rights NGOs from different countries, would 
like to express our deep concern regarding the criminalisation of Judge Baltasar 
Garzón. 
 
On 9 February 2012, Judge Baltasar Garzón Real 
was condemned by the Second Chamber of the Supreme Court of Spain, in a sole 
instance (this being contrary to the European Convention for Human Rights).  He was suspended from working as a judge for 
11 years, thereby definitively losing his judicial functions. 
Proceedings were instigated against Judge Garzón because of the investigation he led 
into the political corruption case known as “Gurtel”, which involved members of 
the Partido Popular.  Garzón was 
charged with illegally wiretapping phone conversations of detainees 
who apparently kept on infringing the law while in prison, with the help 
of their lawyers. As human rights organisations we consider respect for the 
confidentiality of lawyer-client relations as fundamental in a society governed 
by the rule of law. We note, however, that in similar cases, other judges were 
never subject to judicial or even criminal proceedings, and are normally treated 
with internal procedures. The Prosecutor had requested the acquittal of 
Garzón. The Supreme Court rejected the proofs requested by the defence 
counsel and also denied the recusal of magistrates that would not provide 
independence and impartiality during the trial.
 
Judge Garzón has also recently 
been tried as a result of his investigation into the crimes of the Franco 
dictatorship. These proceedings were initiated through a judicial complaint filed by an extreme right group, and 
right now are awaiting sentencing. In this case, the Prosecutor also requested his acquittal. Judge Garzón was tried precisely because he acted in 
accordance with the  obligations of 
Spain under international human rights law and his duty to protect the victims of crimes against humanity. In this case, Judge Garzón was charged with the crime of
forfeit,
for having accepted and assumed it was 
his legal 
duty to 
investigate the truth about the crimes
against humanity committed during the Franco 
dictatorship, in particular in ordering to 
exhume
mass graves
where the remains of 114,266 unidentified 
victims of 
enforced disappearances, torture
and extrajudicial killings are 
buried.
 
In another case, Judge Garzón was prosecuted because of the classes he 
taught at the 
University of New York. However, on 13 February 2012, the Justice dismissed the case for prescription.We 
consider that the temporal coincidence of these three different trials, as well as 
the origin of the complaints, are
evidence of judicial harassment aimed against 
Judge Garzón. The sentence recently imposed upon him, and the other ongoing proceedings 
negatively affect the credibility of the Spanish judiciary, which once deserved the recognition 
of broad sectors 
of the international community for its
rigor
and commitment to universal 
jurisdiction causes and to combat
organised crime. This commitment has symbolised in 
Garzón's work, and 
for which he has risked his
life.
 
For that reason, we share the concern of a group of United Nations 
experts, led by the Special Rapporteur on the Independence of Judges and 
Lawyers, Gabriela Knaul, and the five independent experts of the U.N. Working 
Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances: “it is regrettable that Judge Garzón could be punished for opening an 
investigation which is in line with Spain’s obligations to investigate human 
rights violations in accordance with international law principles”. “Supposed errors in judicial decisions should not be a 
reason for the removal of a judge and, even less, for a criminal proceeding to 
be launched,” Ms. Knaul said, adding that “autonomy in the interpretation of the 
law is a fundamental element in the role of a judge and for progress in human 
rights.”The Special Rapporteur also stated that “reconciliation between the State and the victims of 
enforced disappearances cannot happen without the clarification of each 
individual case, and an amnesty law should not allow an end to a State’s 
obligation to investigate, prosecute and punish those responsible for 
disappearances.”
 

For all those reasons, it is unacceptable and regrettable that in a democracy such as the Spanish one, 
the 
independence of justice could be weakened in 
such a manner, criminalizing a judge who used his independence, among 
others, to implement the International Law 
of Human Rights in its courts decisions.
As Human 
Rights organisations we also would like to express 
our recognition 
to Judge Baltasar Garzón Real for his independent and rigorous actions, in line with international 
obligations of 
States on Human 
Rights, and extend our thanks for his contributing to strengthening 
the right of 
victims to 
truth, justice 
and reparation in our countries.  He 
deserves worldwide recognition.For all 
those reasons we urge you to warranty judicial independence and impartiality, and we anounce and reiterate our support to Baltasar 
Garzón Real 
in the proceedings that will help him restore his good name and his status 
as a Judge.
