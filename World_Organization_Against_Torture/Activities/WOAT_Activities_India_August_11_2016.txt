The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme
of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and FIDH, requests your urgent
intervention in the following situation in India. 
 
Description
of the Situation:
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources of acts of harassment and
intimidation by the police against Mr. Kirity
Roy, human rights defender and founder and Secretary of the human rights
organisation Benglar Manabadhikar Surakksha
Mancha (MASUM)[1], and against Mrs. Tilak
Barman and Messrs. Ajijul Haq, Bisweswar Barman and Ajimuddin Sarkar[2],
also members of the organisation. 
 
According to the information received, on August
5, 2016, police officials from Mekhligunj Police station in Cooch Behar
district of West Bengal attempted to
intimidate Mr. Kirity Roy while he was visiting
enclave dwellers of Mekhligunj rehabilitation and settlement Camps, along with his
other colleagues of MASUM.                         
 
While they were talking to some of the camp
dwellers, the Assistant Sub Inspector from
Mekhligunj Police Station, Mr. Subrata,  approached the members MASUM and inquired in
an intimidating way about the purpose of their presence and meetings. Minutes
after, the members of MASUM left the camp and drove towards the town of
Siliguri. On their way, they noticed that a police vehicle with flashing lights
was following them. The members of MASUM then contacted the residents of the
camp they had just left, who informed them that police officers were present at
the camp, asking about Mr. Kirity Roy, his movements and next destination, and
that they were planning to arrest him on his way to Siliguri. 
These
events occurred in a context of attempts to criminalize and intimidate rights
defenders working on the issue of enclave dwellers. On July 27, 2016, Mr. Kachua Barman[3], leader of an enclave
dwellers community that collaborates closely with MASUM, received a summons to
appear before the Sub Divisional Executive Magistrate-Dinahata’s Court on
August 8, 2016 to face charges under Section 107 of the Criminal Procedure Code
for committing “breach of peace”[4]. 
The Observatory strongly
condemns the harassment and threats against Mr. Roy and would like to underline
that this is not an isolated incident since
several members of MASUM have already faced reprisals[5]
in the past for documenting and denouncing grave human rights violations
allegedly involving members of the police forces and the Border Security Forces
(BSF), and that Mr. Roy has suffered judicial harassment since 2008 (see
background information). 
The Observatory expresses its deep
concern about the ongoing harassment against Mr. Roy and the recurring attacks
perpetrated by the police against MASUM staff members, including judicial
harassment, arbitrary detention, ill-treatment and threats. The Observatory
more generally calls upon the Indian authorities to put an end to all attempts
to intimidate and criminalize members of MASUM and to guarantee the security,
physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Kirity Roy and MASUM staff, as well
as that of all human rights defenders in India. 
Background information: 
 
On April 7, 2010, the
Anti-Terrorist Cell of Kolkata arrested Mr. Kirity Roy under sections 120B
(“punishment of criminal conspiracy”), 170 (“impersonating a public servant”)
and 229 (“impersonation of a juror or assessor”) of the Indian Penal Code[6].
Those charges were initiated following a People’s Tribunal on Torture (PPT), a
public hearing that was conducted by MASUM in Moulali, Kolkata, and during
which 1,200 victims of torture and their families were present and 82 victims
provided testimonies. This case against Mr.
Roy is still pending in the Supreme Court of India.
 
In 2014, the police
issued a warrant of arrest against Mr. Kirity Roy as co-accused in relation to
a criminal case filed against Mr. Ajimuddin Sarkar[7].  
 
Actions requested:
 
Please write to the authorities of India asking
them to:
 
i.      
Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological
integrity of Mr. Kirity Roy and all the members of MASUM, as well as of all
human rights defenders in India;
 
ii.    
Put an end to all acts
of harassment - including at the judicial level - against Mr. Kirity Roy and all
the members of MASUM, as well as against all
human rights defenders in India so that they are able to carry out their work
without hindrances;
 
iii.   
Conform in any circumstances with the provisions of the UN
Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the
United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its Article 1 and 12.2;
 
iv.   
More generally, ensure in all circumstances the respect for human
rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights and with international and regional human rights instruments
ratified by India.
