The 2006 Annual Report of the Observatory documents acts of repression faced by 1,311 human rights defenders, as well as obstacles to freedom of association, in about 90 countries around the world.  This new edition, of which Mr. Kofi Annan, former Secretary General of the United Nations Organisation, is the author of the foreword, and which coincides with the tenth anniversary of the Observatory, pays tribute to these women and men who, every day, and often risking their own lives, fight for law to triumph over arbitrariness. At the occasion of the launching of this report, several press conferences and meetings are being organised throughout March, in particular in France, Switzerland, Belgium, Georgia, Burkina Faso, Tunisia, Egypt, Colombia, Philippines, Djibouti, Democratic Republic of Congo, Cambodia, Malaysia, Burundi, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Italia, etc. thanks to the support of the member organisations and partners of OMCT and FIDH.
