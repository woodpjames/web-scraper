Brief description :  The Observatory has been informed by the Human Rights Association  (IHD) in Ankara that Mr. Ridvan Kizgin, Chairman of the Bingöl Branch  of the IHD, received telephone threats on 8 and 9 July.  According to the information received, on 5 July, the Bingöl branch  of IHD released its report on the human rights situation in the  province of Bingöl during the six-month period from January to June  2003, showing an increase in human rights violations including ill- treatment and harassment by state agents (police and  gendarmerie).  The report, based on the testimonies of victims, was presented by Mr.  Kizgin during several press conferences.   On 8 July at around 10.30pm. Mr. Kizgin reportedly recieved a call on  his mobile phone by a person who introduced herself as the Provincial  Commander for Gendarmerie Regiment and asked Mr. Kizgin to report to  the Provincial Commandership. The reason invoked was that his  statements on human rights violations were false. He was asked not  not make new statements before he has talked to the Provincial  Commander and to explain to the press and public opinion that human  rights violations denounced were not representing the reality. Mr.  Kizgin refused to go to the Commandership.  On 9 July, Mr. Kizgin was reportedly called again on his mobile phone  at around 9.30am. The person on the phone said that the Commander  wanted to see him and asked him to come to the Commandership to  withdraw his statements on human rights violations and to make a new  statement that these allegations were not correct. Mr. Kizgin refused  again and condemned the method used by the provincial authorities.  The Observatory is very concerned by these threats against Mr. Kizgin  and would like to recall that since it was set up on 12th April 2001,  the Bingöl Branch of the IHD has been constantly subjected to  pressure (searches of its premises, documents confiscated, seal of  the association seized, etc). In addition, there has been a total of  47 court cases launched against Mr. Kizgin, on the grounds of the  activities that he carries out in the framework of the IHD. There are  already 5 investigations pending against him launched by the  prosecution (see Obervatory report on international mission of  judiciary observation, Judiciary harassment against human rights  defenders in Turkey, December 2002 and Annual Report 2002).   IHD immediately denounced this situation to the Prime Minister, the  Foreign and Interior Ministers, the General Command of Gendarmerie  and to the Human Rights Parliamentary Comission. Thirteen board  members of the organization were killed by extra judicial killing  during the 1990s after they received telephone similar phone calls.   Action requested  Please write to the authorities in Turkey urging them to:  i.   put an end to any kind of harassment and threats against Mr.  Kizgin and all human rights defenders in the country, and ensure that  they be allowed to carry out their work without obstacles; ii.   abide by the provisions of the Declaration on the Protection of  Human Rights Defenders adopted on the 9th of December 1998, by the  U.N.
