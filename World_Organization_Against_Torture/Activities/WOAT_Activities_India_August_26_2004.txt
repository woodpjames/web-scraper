Brief description of the situation:  The Observatory has been informed by the Asian Human Rights Commission (AHRC) that activists of the Jangipara branch of the Association for Protection of Democratic Rights (APDR), a leading human rights organization in West Bengal working for the cause of democratic rights since 1972, were attacked by local leaders of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPIM) on August 21, 2004 in Hooghly, greater Kolkota.  According to information received, at about 4:30pm on August 21, 2004, the human rights defenders in question had assembled for a peaceful street-meeting against state-repression at the Jangipara Bus stand. The local APDR members were joined for the occasion by Sri Sujato Bhadra, the General Secretary of APDR, Sri Amitadyuti Kumar, the Vice-President, Prof. Sanjib Acharya, the Secretary of Hooghly District Committee, and Secretariat Members Sri Bapi Dasgupta, Sri Raghunath Chakraborty, Sri Shankar Nandy, Sri Sukumar Tiwari, Sri Tushar Chakraborty. The APDR meeting, which had been pre-arranged and peaceful, was suddenly interrupted by a group of 50 to 60 persons who attacked the gathering by kicking and beating them with their fists and poles, and verbally abusing them.   Although a contingent of police was posted nearby the place of the attack, and the victims rushed to the police station, no police officers came to stop the violence or arrest the perpetrators. After breaking up the APDR meeting, the attacking group then began their own meeting, labelling APDR’s members as part of an opposition party plot. The victims of the attack, among which Sri Amitadyuti Kumar, Vice-President of APDR, and Gautam Munshi, Treasurer of the Hooghly District Committee, were later treated in Walsh Hospital, Srirampur.  The Indian authorities’ inaction toward fulfilling the State duty to protect human rights defenders disregards the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, in particular article 12(2), which states that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in [the present] Declaration.”   The Observatory urges the government of India and the relevant authorities to conduct a full inquiry of the incident and to ensure that human rights defenders are properly protected in the state of West Bengal.    Actions requested: Please write to the Indian authorities and ask them to:  i. ensure the respect of the physical and psychological integrity of the activists of the Jangipara branch of the APDH and that of other human rights defenders.  ii. conduct the immediate investigation of the attack on the activists of the Jangipara branch of the Association for Protection of Democratic Rights (APDR), bringing the attackers to justice and holding to account the police officers concerned for their inaction;  iii. conform with the provisions of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, specifically article 12(2), mentioned above, and more generally article 1 which states that “everyone has the right, individually or in association with others, to promote the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”;  iv. adopt immediate measures to put an end to all acts of violence against human rights defenders;  v. ensure in all circumstances the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by India.
