Arbitrary arrest /
Incommunicado detention / Search and seizure
Thailand
May 25, 2014
 
The Observatory for the
Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the International
Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation Against Torture
(OMCT), requests your urgent intervention in
the following situation in Thailand.
 
Description of the situation:
 
The Observatory has been
informed by reliable sources about the arrest of 

Ms. Sukanya
Phrueksakasemsuk, a human rights defender campaigning for the right of
political prisoners and the wife of Mr. Somyot
Phueksakasemsuk, Editor of the magazine “Voice of Thaksin” who
is now serving 11 years for lèse-majesté, and her son. 
 
According to the
information received, on May 25, 2014, at around 3.30 p.m, Thai army soldiers
searched the house of Mr. Somyot Phueksakasemsuk. The soldiers arrested his
wife Ms. Sukanya Phrueksakasemsuk and her son, Mr. Panitan Phrueksakase, and
detained them at an undisclosed location. The army also seized Ms. Sukanya’s
two computer laptops.
 
Since their arrest, Ms.
Sukanya and Mr. Panitan have been held incommunicado in an unknown location.
Soldiers failed to inform them of the reasons for their arrest. As of May 25,
2014, the two had not had access to their lawyer. 
 
Ms. Sukanya and Mr. Panitan
are among the about 200 people who have been detained by Thailand’s military
junta, the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO), since it seized power
on May 22, 2014. Among those detained are human rights defenders, journalists,
academics, political activists, politicians, and anti-coup peaceful protesters.

The
Observatory is concerned by the arbitrary arrest and incommunicado detention of
Ms. Sukanya Phrueksakasemsuk and Mr. Panitan Phrueksakase, and calls upon the
authorities in Thailand to immediately disclose their whereabouts and put an
end to any kind of harassment against them as it seems to only aim at
sanctioning the human rights activities of their relative Mr. Somyot Phueksakasemsuk.

 
Background information:
 
Mr. Somyot Prueksakasemsuk,
a labour rights activist, was among the first activists in Thailand trying to
unionise workers, providing them with legal training, and organising camp
activities and public demonstrations. In his magazine “Voice of Thaksin”
Somyot Prueksakasemsuk denounced human rights abuses and gave a voice to the
voiceless. Mr. Somyot Prueksakasemsuk is also a free speech advocate, calling
for the revision of the lèse-majesté law. In April 2011, he was arrested five
days after launching a petition campaign to secure a review of this
legislation. Held in pre-trial detention for 17 months, Mr. Somyot
Prueksakasemsuk was convicted for allowing, as an editor, the publication of
two satirical articles that were deemed to be “insulting the monarchy”. In
January 2013, he was arbitrarily sentenced to 10 years in prison.
