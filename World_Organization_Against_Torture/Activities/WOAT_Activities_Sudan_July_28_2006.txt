Brief description of the situation The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Sudan Organisation Against Torture (SOAT), a member of the OMCT network, that twenty women were attacked and most of them also raped by approximately 25 armed militias, some in army uniform. These events took place on 24 July 2006, outside Kalma internally displaced camp in Nyala, Southern Darfur.   According to the information received, the women were attacked whilst they were collecting firewood. They had gone outside the camp as a collective in the false belief that they would be safe from attack as a group. During the attack, the militias beat the women with the butt of their guns and flogged them before raping seventeen of the women. The women are aged between 19 and 42 years old, and they are all from the Fur tribe.   The incident has been reported to the African Union Mission in the Sudan (AMIS) in Kalma camp. SOAT's network of lawyers in Nyala is providing legal assistance to the women.  OMCT strongly condemns the continuing sexual violence against women and girls in Darfur perpetrated by armed militias with impunity. OMCT is particularly concerned that women and girls continue to venture outside IDP camps to undertake tasks including fetching firewood to sell to subsides their income or to cook with despite the presence of AMIS, and that no escort is available to accompany them. Background  There has been steady gathering of armed militias, reportedly the Janjaweed, in the surrounding areas of Kalma camp. These militias besides attacking humanitarian workers undertake nightly incursions into the camp for purposes of looting. The militias allege that rather than raiding the camp, they are responding to alleged theft of their cows and horses by IDPs from Kalma camp. At a recent incursion by armed militias into Kalma camp one male IDP was killed and two others injured (See OMCT Urgent Appeal SDN 040706). Requested Action Please write to the authorities in Sudan and to AU urging them to:  i.	Ensure the physical and psychological integrity of the 20 women by guaranteeing that they be provided with adequate medical care and protection; ii.	Order a thorough and impartial investigation into these events, in order to identify all those responsible, bring them to trial and apply the penal and/or administrative sanctions as provided by law;  iii.	Ensure women and girls the right to be free from discrimination, including violence, in line with the international laws and standards; iv.	Guarantee the respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international humanitarian law and human rights standards.
