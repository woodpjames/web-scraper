It explicitly addresses the situation of two women sentenced to death by stoning for allegedly committing adultery. This case has been documented by the OMCT in a violence against women urgent appeal dated 9 April 2007. Sadia Idriss Fadul and Amouna Abdallah Daldoum appealed the criminal court sentence and are about to be retried in Sudan’s Gazeera state. International pressure can have a crucial impact on these young women’s destinies.  For additional information, please contact OMCT’s Violence against Women Programme.
