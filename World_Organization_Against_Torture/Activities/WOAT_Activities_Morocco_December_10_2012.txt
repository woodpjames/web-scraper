Geneva, Rabat,
10 December 2012 
 
Today a delegation of experts of the World
Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) is beginning its mission to Morocco. The
objective of the mission is to assess the level of implementation of the UN Committee
Against Torture’s conclusion and recommendation in the fight against torture
issued one year ago.
 
The delegation is led by Dick Marty, OMCT’s Vice-president, former state
prosecutor of the Canton of Ticino, member of the Swiss Council of States and former
President of the Legal and Human Rights Committee of the Parliamentary Assembly
of the Council of Europe. The OMCT’s Human Rights Officer for the Middle East
and North Africa region, Belkis Wille, is accompanying him on this mission. The
mission is undertaken in cooperation with members of the SOS Torture Network,
the Moroccan Organisations for Human Rights (OMDH) and the Association for
Human Rights in Morocco (AMDH).
 
The UN Committee Against Torture, the UN’s
authoritative expert body reviewing states compliance with the UN Convention
Against Torture, had issued a year ago a range of recommendations to prevent
torture and to ensure accountability for acts of torture. The OMCT mission aims
to collect information on the progress of implementation and to engage with
different governmental authorities, the national human rights institution and
civil society, victims and their families, and representatives of the
international community, on the best way to forward in the fight against torture
at this critical juncture in Morocco.
 
This follow-up mission forms part of global efforts led
by the OMCT to foster the implementation of the recommendations of the UN
Committee Against Torture undertaken with the financial support of the European
Union and the Oak Foundation.
