The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint 
programme of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World 
Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent intervention in the 
following situation in Turkey.
 
Description of the situation:
 
The Observatory has been informed by the Human Rights Association (İHD) about the police raid of the offices of its Diyarbakır branch as 
well as that of the General Centre of the Public Workers’ Trade Union (KESK), 
the Education Workers’ Trade Union (Egitim-Sen), the Kurdish Language Research 
and Development Association (Kurdi-Der) and the Solidarity Association For 
Prisoners' and Convicts' Relatives (Tuhay-Der).
 
According to the information received, in the early morning of 
January 13, 2012, the anti-terrorism unit of the police raided on the basis of 
an illegal search warrant[1] the offices in 
Diyarbakır of İHD, KESK, Egitim-Sen, Kurdi-Der and Tuhay-Der, in the framework 
of a wide ranged anti-terrorist operation intended to dismantle an alleged 
terrorist network - the Kurdish Communities Union (KCK)[2] - that in fact 
targets peaceful activists from the Kurdish community who are not related to any 
terrorist activities, including human rights defenders and associations. The 
police confiscated computers found on the premises of all organisations. All 
were later returned except those confiscated  in  İHD's offices. 
 
The Observatory denounces the continuing harassment of human rights 
defenders and organisations in Turkey, and particularly İHD members, members of 
trade unions and those fighting against the impunity of serious crimes and 
calling for a peaceful resolution of the Kurd question, which seems to merely 
aim at sanctioning their human rights activities. To that extent, the 
Observatory recalls that several İHD members are currently in pre-trial 
detention, notably Mr. Muharrem Erbey, İHD General Vice Chairperson and 
Chairperson of its Diyarbakir Province branch who had been detained since 
December 2009, Mr. Arslan Özdemir, Ms. Roza Erdede, İHD members in 
Diyarbakır[3], Mr. Ragıp 
Zarakolu, Honorary Board Member and Founder of İHD and publisher, and Ms. 
Büşra Ersanlı, lecturer at the Marmara University Faculty of Political 
Sciences and International Relations in Istanbul[4], members of 
associations of families of victims of abusive anti-terrorism policies[5] and lawyers[6]. Dozens of 
other human rights defenders remain in provisional release pending the outcome 
of criminal trials on alleged terrorism charges[7].
 
Accordingly, the Observatory calls upon the Turkish authorities to 
put an end to the continuing harassment against human rights associations and 
defenders and urges the Turkish authorities to stop raids and release all human 
rights defenders held in detention immediately and unconditionally, since their detention is 
arbitrary.
 
Actions requested:
 
i. Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological 
integrity of Mr. Ragıp Zarakolu, Ms. Büşra Ersanlı, Mr. Muharrem Erbey, Mr. Arslan Özdemir and Ms. Roza Erdede as well 
as all other members of İHD, KESK, Egitim-Sen, Kurdi-Der and Tuhay-Der, members 
of associations of families of victims of abusive anti-terrorism policies and 
lawyers, and in general, all human rights defenders in 
Turkey;
 
ii. Release immediately and unconditionally Mr. Ragıp Zarakolu, Ms. Büşra Ersanlı, Mr. Muharrem Erbey, Mr. Arslan Özdemir and Ms. Roza Erdede as well 
as members of associations of families of victims of abusive anti-terrorism 
policies and lawyers who are currently detained, since their detention is arbitrary as it only aim at sanctioning 
their human rights activities;
 
iii. Put an end to all acts harassment, including at the judicial level, 
against Mr. Ragıp Zarakolu, Ms. Büşra Ersanlı, Mr. Muharrem Erbey, Mr. Arslan Özdemir and Ms. Roza Erdede as well 
as all other members of İHD, KESK, Egitim-Sen, Kurdi-Der, Tuhay-Der, members of 
associations of families of victims of abusive anti-terrorism policies and 
lawyers and, in general, all human rights defenders in Turkey;
 
iv. Comply with the provisions of the United Nations Declaration on 
Human Rights Defenders, especially its Article 1, which states that “everyone 
has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to 
strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms at the national and international levels”, as well as Article 12.2, 
which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the 
protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in 
association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or 
de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a 
consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the 
present Declaration”;
 
v. More generally, ensure in all circumstances the respect for human 
rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international and regional 
human rights instruments ratified by Turkey.
