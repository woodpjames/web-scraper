New information: The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources of new charges brought against Mr. Michel Kilo, a writer, a journalist and former president of the Organisation for the Defence of Freedom of Speech and Press. According to the information received, on October 19, 2006, the examining judge (qadi al-ihala) decided to order the release of Mr. Michel Kilo, who was detained at the Adra prison since May 14, 2006. According to the decision, Mr. Kilo had to pay a 1.000 Syrian Lira bail (20 US $), which his lawyers did. However, the decision was not sent to the prison, although it was transmitted to the Public Ministry by the judge. As the offices were closed on Friday and Saturday, October 20 and 21, 2006, Mr. Kilo’s lawyers were only able to question the ongoing detention of Mr. Kilo on October 22, 2006. On this occasion, they were surprised to see that a new act of accusation had been drawn up against Mr. Kilo, which was dated October 19, 2006, a few hours after the decision to release him was taken by the judge. Moreover, they were told that the former file of Mr. Kilo had been “lost”. According to the information received, Mr. Kilo is now accused of “undermining national pride” (article 285), “disseminating false news, harming the State’s reputation” (article 287 and 376) and “inciting to confessional and racial  hatred” (article 307). The Observatory is very preoccupied by Mr. Kilo’s situation and very concerned about this way to proceed by the Syrian judiciary, which is a clear proof of its lack of independence and seems to indicate that the Syrian authorities want him to stay in prison at any price. Furthermore, the Observatory recalls that Mr. Anouar Al Bunni, founding member of the Syrian Human Rights Association (ASDH) and member of the Committee for the Defence of Prisoners of Conscience, who was arrested in the same circumstances on May 17, 2006, also remains detained at the Adra prison. Mr. Bunni has been charged, in particular, with “undermining national pride” and “incitement to racial and sectorial hatred”. Background information: Mr. Michel Kilo was arrested on May 14, 2006 after having been summoned to the Syrian intelligence services. Mr. Kilo is one of the leaders of the Syrian NGOs discussion clubs, which regularly debate on issues related to political reform, democracy and human rights in Syria. He is also a journalist at al-Quds, a leading daily newspaper in Arabic that is published in London. He already spent two years in prison in the early 1980s and had also been shortly arrested with others at the end of March 2006, in the context of a wave of repression against civil society activists in Syria. Mr. Kilo had been arrested in May 2006, along with nine other human rights defenders and political activists, after signing the “Beirut-Damascus Declaration”, a petition drawn up by Syrian and Lebanese intellectuals and human rights activists calling for the improvement of the relations between the two countries (see FIDH / OMCT joint press release dated May 18, 2006 and Observatory press release dated July, 28, 2006). All of them have been release since then, except Mr. Kilo and Mr. Anouar Al Bunni.
