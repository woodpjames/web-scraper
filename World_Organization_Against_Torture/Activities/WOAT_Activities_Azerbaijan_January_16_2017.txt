16 January 2017
We are writing with a view to the criminal case against the former 
Vice President of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe 
(PACE), Mr. Luca Volonte, who is being investigated by the Milan public 
prosecutor’s office for allegedly accepting €2.39m in bribes from two 
members of PACE, Mr. Elkhan Suleymanov and Mr. Muslim Mammadov, in 
exchange for his efforts to thwart the 2013 critical resolution on 
political prisoners in Azerbaijan.
We urge you to immediately expel the two members of the Azerbaijani 
delegation accused of bribing other members (Elkhan Suleymanov and 
Muslim Mammadov), pending a full investigation. Furthermore, we urge you
 to suspend the voting rights of the entire Azerbaijani delegation, 
which we believe were completely aware of the bribery but failed to take
 a single step to stop it.
The European Stability Initiative’s report: The European Swamp (Caviar Diplomacy Part 2) – Prosecutors, Corruption and the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly [1] as well as the investigation conducted by the Italian broadcaster RAI reveal shameful details of the corruption scam.
To this end, the 2013 vote on Mr. Christoph Strässer’s resolution may
 not be considered legitimate. As a matter of urgency, PACE should 
immediately re-establish the mandate of a special rapporteur on 
political prisoners in Azerbaijan – a credible member of PACE with a 
solid record of scrutinising and reporting on human rights abuses – to 
write an objective report, in cooperation with the Council of Europe 
INGO conference experts and internationally-recognised rights watchdogs.
We recall that, in 2014, PACE, through its Committee on Legal Affairs
 and Human Rights (AS Jur) decided to proceed with a separate report 
titled “Azerbaijan’s Chairmanship of the Council of Europe: What 
follow-up on respect for human rights”. Since then, there has been no 
meaningful follow-up after the 2014 decision.  In the most recent 
example, neither the As Jur rapporteur nor his colleagues at the 
Monitoring Committee, and not even the PACE leadership, reacted to the 
harsh ten-year sentences handed down by a court in Azerbaijan to young 
political activists Giyas Ibrahimov and Bayram Mammadov, along with 
allegations of ill-treatment during their detention. To the contrary, 
the European Union immediately issued a statement, in which they called 
the sentences “particularly worrying [2]”.
On 18 November 2016, the highest court in Azerbaijan considered the 
appeal by the Azerbaijani political prisoner and opposition leader Mr. 
Ilgar Mammadov against his seven-year long prison sentence and ruled to 
uphold it. The continued illegal imprisonment of Mr. Mammadov 
constitutes a blatant breach of Azerbaijan’s explicit legal obligations,
 and is an affront to the Committee of Ministers of the Council of 
Europe, which has repeatedly demanded that Azerbaijan comply with the 
2014 decision by the European Court of Human Rights and immediately and 
unconditionally release Ilgar Mammadov.  Contrary to the Committee of 
Ministers, which is now considering legal action against Azerbaijan, 
PACE has failed to take a decisive action against such a flagrant and 
persistent violation of the Convention and of the principles on which it
 is founded, including respect for the binding judgments of the European
 Court of Human Rights.
To this end, we call on PACE to eliminate any trace of corruption and
 misconduct within the Pan-European human rights organisation, and to 
demonstrate a strong and consolidated stance on human rights violations 
in Azerbaijan. Specifically, we urge you do the following:
– Immediately expel the two members of the Azerbaijani delegation 
accused of bribing other members (Elkhan Suleymanov and Muslim 
Mammadov), pending a full investigation.– Suspend the voting rights of the entire Azerbaijani delegation, 
pending a full investigation into the corruption and until Ilgar 
Mammadov and other political prisoners have been released.– Re-establish the mandate of a special rapporteur on political 
prisoners in Azerbaijan – a credible member of PACE with a solid record 
of scrutinising and reporting on human rights abuses – to write an 
objective report in cooperation with the Council of Europe INGO 
conference experts and internationally-recognised rights watchdogs.– Call for an urgent debate on the corruption scam within the 
Council of Europe; appoint a special ethical commission to investigate 
alleged involvement of the other members of PACE in the bribery case.
Thank you for considering this important matter.
