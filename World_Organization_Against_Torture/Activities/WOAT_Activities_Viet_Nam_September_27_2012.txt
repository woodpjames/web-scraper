The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of
the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation
Against Torture (OMCT), has received new information and requests your urgent
intervention in the following situation in Viet Nam.
 
New information:
 
The Observatory has been informed by the Vietnam
Committee on Human Rights (VCHR) about the heavy sentences pronounced against
Mr. Nguyen Van Hai (alias Dieu Cay), Founder of the Club
of Free Journalists and prominent blogger, Mr. Phan Thanh Hai and Ms. Ta
Phong Tan,
bloggers and members of the Club of Free Journalists.
 
According to the information received, on September
24, 2012, the Supreme People's Court of Ho Chi Minh City sentenced Mr. Dieu Cay
to twelve years' imprisonment and five years' probationary detention, Ms. Ta Phong Tan to ten years' imprisonment
and five years' probation and Mr. Phan
Thanh Hai to four year's
imprisonment and three years' probation on charges of “conducting propaganda
against the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam” under Article 88 of the Criminal
Code for posting articles on their blogs that supposedly “distorted and opposed
the State”.
 
The trial was marred by grave procedural
irregularities that blatantly contravene fair trial standards. First of all,
the trial failed to comply with the right to a public hearing as provided for
by Article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
(ICCPR). Quite on the contrary, the trial was closed to the public as bloggers
and Mr. Dieu Cay's family were prevented from attending it. Hundreds of
Security Police members intercepted, beat and/or arrested dissidents and
bloggers who intended to access the court. At least 12 bloggers were taken into
custody: Bui Thi Minh Hang, Trinh Kiem Tien, Nguyen Ho Nhat, Nguyen Thi Phuong,
Nguyen Hoang Vi, Nguyen Tien Nam, Nguyen Van Dung, Pham Quoc Tuan, law student Trinh
Anh Tuan, Huynh Cong Thuan, Chau Van Thi, Le Quoc Quyet and Lu Thi Thu Trang, as
well as the poet Bui Chat. Moreover, Mr. Dieu Cay's ex-wife and son were
arrested on their way to the trial, and members of the secret police reportedly
prevented his youngest daughter from leaving her home to attend. Furthermore,
cell phone access was blocked in the court's vicinity and the prominent blog
Dan Lam Bao (Citizens’ Journalism), which posted hour-by-hour reports on the
events, was fire-walled. 
 
The right to defence and the right to
equality of arms were also infringed as the Court cut off the microphone when
Mr. Dieu Cay spoke to defend himself; the
Court also rejected the defense lawyer's demand to call witnesses for the
defense and failed to produce any of the 26 articles on Dieu Cay’s blog that
formed the basis of the charges of “anti-Socialist propaganda”. Moreover, Dieu
Cay was denied the right to consult a lawyer and the right to a defense,
including the right to challenge his pre-trial detention, during the first 16
months of his pre-trial detention (October 2010 and February 2012) as the
authorities refused to inform his family of his whearebouts In preparation of
the hearing, the defense lawyer was not provided with the full file of
accusations against Dieu Cay, and the latter received no notification from the
judges until the morning of the trial itself.
 
The Observatory expresses its grave concern at these
heavy sentences and strongly denounces the conditions in which the trial was
held. Besides amounting to an unacceptable restriction of their fundamental
right to freedom of expression, the verdict and arrest of bloggers seem to
merely aim at sanctioning legitimate human rights activities. 
 
The Observatory therefore calls on the Vietnamese
judicial authorities to review the conviction of Mr. Dieu Cay, Ms. Ta Phong Tan
and Mr. Phan Thanh Hai.
 
Background
information:
 
Mr. Dieu Cay was arrested in April 2008 and sentenced to two and a
half years in prison at an unfair trial on trumped-up charges of “tax evasion”
in September 2008[1].
In fact, he had posted articles on the Internet calling for human rights and
democratic reforms, and staged demonstrations during the Beijing Olympic games.
In 2009, the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention declared Mr.
Dieu Cay to be a victim of arbitrary detention (Opinion 1/2009).
He was due for release
on October 19, 2010 after having completed his prison term, but his family was
then informed that he would remain in detention under the new charges of
“propaganda against the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam”.
 
As for Mr. Phan Thanh Hai and Ms. Ta Phong Tan,
they were arrested respectively on October 18, 2010 and September 5, 2011 and
have been held in detention at the headquarters of
the Ho Chi Minh City Security Police Investigations Department (Phan Dang Luu
Street), along with Dieu Cay, and charged under Article 88 of the Criminal Code
as well. Before his arrest, Mr. Phan Thanh Hai published in particular an
analysis outlining that Article 88 of the Criminal Code violated the right to
freedom of expression enshrined in the Constitution, and that it should be
abrogated. Ms. Ta Phong Tan posted articles on police abuse and violations of
human rights by the State. 
 
Their
trial was re-scheduled on April and August 2012. 
 
On
September 15, 2012, their lawyers were officially notified that the trial would
finally take place on September 24, 2012. In the afternoon of September 16,
2012, Mr. Dieu Cay's ex wife, along with a sister of Ms. Ta Phong Tan, were
reportedly arrested and interrogated at the police station on accusations of
causing a traffic incident after they got out of the taxi that drove them to a
ceremony to commemorate the 49-day of Ms. Ta Phong Tan's death. The same day,
they were also assaulted by thugs in front of policemen who made no attempt to
intervene. It is to be recalled that on July 30, 2012, Ms. Ta Phong Tan's
mother, Ms. Dang Thi Kim Lieng, immolated herself outside the People’s
Committee headquarters in Bac Lieu to protest against her daughter’s unfair
imprisonment. 
 
Actions requested:

Please write to the authorities in Viet Nam urging them to:
 
i. Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and
psychological integrity of Mr. Dieu Cay, Mr. Phan Thanh Hai and Ms. Ta Phong Tan, as
well as of all human rights defenders in Viet Nam;
 
ii. Release Mr. Dieu Cay, Mr. Phan Thanh Hai and Ms. Ta
Phong Tan immediately and unconditionally as their detention
seems to merely sanction their human rights activities and is contrary to
national and international law;
 
iii. Put
an end to all acts harassment, including at the judicial level, against Mr. Dieu Cay, Mr. Phan Thanh Hai and Ms. Ta
Phong Tan, as
well as against all human rights defenders in Viet Nam;
 
iv. Comply with the provisions of the UN Declaration
on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the UN
General Assembly on December 9, 1998, in particular:
- its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the
right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive
for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at
the national and international levels”, 
- as well as Article 12.2, which provides that “the
State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the
competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others,
against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse
discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his
or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present
Declaration”;
 
v. More generally, ensure in all circumstances
respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with
international and regional human rights instruments ratified by Viet Nam.

Dieu Cay was unjustly accused of having failed for ten years to pay taxes on
premises. Said taxes should have been paid by the owner of the premises not
Dieu Cay, who was only renting them.
