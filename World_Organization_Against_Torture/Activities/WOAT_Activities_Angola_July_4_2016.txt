Paris-Geneva-Luanda,
July 4, 2016 - The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders (a
partnership of FIDH and OMCT), and the Working Group of Monitoring Human
Rights in Angola (GTMDH)[1]
welcome the decision of the Supreme Court to order the provisional release of
the 17 rights activists jailed for participating in a book club meeting in June
2015, where one of the works under discussion was a book about non-violent
resistance to repressive regimes. The organisations also welcome the recent
decision of the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (WGAD) recognising
the arbitrary nature of their detention. FIDH, OMCT, AJPD and OSISA-ANGOLA had
filed a communication to the WGAD on their behalf on September 23, 2015. 
On June 29,
2016, the Supreme Court of Angola eventually ordered the conditional release of
17 young activists, three months after they were jailed for rebellion and a
year after their arbitrary arrest[2].

Some of the
youths have spent 12 months in detention. Sixteen were released but remain
subjected to Term of Residential Identity. The seventeenth, Mr. Manuel
Chivonde Baptista Nito Alves, is serving a six-month prison term for
“contempt of court”. 
Their
release is provisional, pending the outcome of the appellate judicial
proceedings. On March 28, 2016, the Luanda Provincial Tribunal sentenced the 16
pro-democracy activists to jail terms ranging from two years and three months
to eight years and six months for the alleged crimes of “preparatory acts of
rebellion” (Article 21 of the Criminal Code) and “association of criminals”
(Article 263), among other charges[3].
“While we welcome the long-awaited
release of sixteen of the young rights activists, we strongly deplore the
judicial harassment which led to this arbitrary detention for more than a year”,
our organisations said today.
On the same
day that the Angola Supreme Court issued its order, the WGAD released its
Opinion concerning the detention of 14 of the young rights activists[4].

The WGAD considered that “these individuals were arrested
and detained because of the exercise of their freedom of assembly, opinion and
expression” in violation of Articles 19 and 20 of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights (UDHR) and Articles 19 and 21 of the International Covenant on
Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). It also stated that their right to a fair
trial had not been respected to the extent that their deprivation of liberty
was arbitrary. The Working group finally concluded that as an
adequate remedy for their arbitrary detention, the Angola authorities should
immediately release the activists still in detention, compensate them and put
an end to all unlawful criminal proceedings against them. 
“We
welcome the Opinion of the WGAD, to which our organisations submitted a
communication on this case. Now the Angola
authorities must implement the WGAD decision and drop all charges against the
17 activists and more generally stop the harassment of all human right
defenders in the country”, concluded our organisations. 
The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders was created in 1997 by
FIDH and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT). The objective of this
programme is to intervene to prevent or remedy situations of repression against
human rights defenders.
