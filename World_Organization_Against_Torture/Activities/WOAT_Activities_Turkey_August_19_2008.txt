Brief description of the situation: The Observatory has been informed by the Human Rights Association (İnsan Haklari Derneği - İHD) about the police excessive use of force and judicial harassment against Mr. Ethem Açıkalın, President of the Adana branch of the İHD, and Mr. Hüseyin Beyaz, İHD Treasurer. According to the information received, on August 14, 2008, about 44 people, including administrators of the Democratic Society Party (DTP), provincial and district organisations in Adana, Küçük Dikili Mayor and Misis Mayor were detained from their house in early morning. Within the framework of these detentions, police and gendarmerie forces planned to raid Adana DTP provincial organisation. After the İHD Adana branch was informed of these events, Mr. Ethem Açıkalın and Mr. Hüseyin Beyaz went immediately to observe the scene. When Messrs. Açıkalın and Beyaz entered into the DTP building, they saw the police raid. After a while, police force members asked Messrs. Açıkalın and Beyaz why they had come there. They replied that they had come because they got a call about these events, and because part of their activities was to get information and prepare reports about detentions and to release these reports to the public. After a short argument, police forces forcibly took Mr. Ethem Açıkalın and Mr. Hüseyin Beyaz out. They threw them from the DTP building, located on the third floor, in the stairs. As a result, Mr. Beyaz’s arm was broken. Mr. Beyaz was taken to the State Hospital in Adana, where he got a medical report that stated he would be disable for service for the next two months. Furthermore, the Adana police forces immediately filed a complaint against Messrs. Ethem Açıkalın and Hüseyin Beyaz for “resisting against police forces”. The İHD Adana branch is also planning to file a criminal complaint. The Observatory expresses its deepest concerns about these events, which seems to merely aim at sanctioning the human rights activities of Messrs. Ethem Açıkalın and Hüseyin Beyaz, in a context of increasing harassment and judicial proceedings against human rights defenders in Turkey. The Observatory urges the Turkish authorities to conform to the Declaration of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe on Human Rights Defenders, so as to create an environment conductive to human rights defenders, to take effective measures to protect, promote, and respect them, to ensure their access to effective remedies, to take action to prevent attacks and harassment against them.  The Observatory further recalls that as a Participating State of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), Turkey acknowledges that “the [...] UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders [... places] a responsibility [...] on states to adopt and implement adequate legislation and administrative procedures that would provide for a conducive environment for human rights defenders to promote and strive for the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, and recognises “the need for particular attention, support and protection for human rights defenders by the OSCE, its Institutions and field operations, as well as by participating States”[1]. Actions required: Please write to the Turkish authorities, urging them to:   Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Messrs. Ethem Açıkalın and Hüseyin Beyaz;  Order a thorough and impartial investigation into the above-mentioned threats and acts of intimidation, in order to identify all those responsible, bring them before a civil competent and impartial tribunal and apply to them the penal sanctions provided by the law;  Put an end to all acts harassment, including at the judicial level, against Messrs. Ethem Açıkalın and Hüseyin Beyaz and all human rights defenders in Turkey;  Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly on December 9, 1998, especially its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, as well as Article 12.2, which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”;  More generally, ensure in all circumstances the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international and regional human rights instruments ratified by Turkey.
