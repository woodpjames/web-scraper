Regarding the particular situation of children’s rights in Benin, OMCT has submitted an alternative report to the Committee’s pre-session on 6th June 2006 highlighting the complexity of violence against children within Beninese society, where children are far from being considered as real subjects of rights but rather as parental or familiar belongings. Address poverty and sensitise the population to change mentalities remain the keys to improve children’s situation.
