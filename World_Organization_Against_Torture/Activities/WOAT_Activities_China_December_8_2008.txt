Description of the situation: The Observatory has been informed by Human Rights in China (HRIC) about the enforced disappearance and arbitrary detention of five of the organisers of the Guizhou Fourth Annual Human Rights Symposium and the commemoration of the 60th Anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. According to the information received, on December 4, 2008, Messrs. Chen Xi and Shen Youlian were taken away by police. On the evening of December 4, Mr. Chen’s wife received a phone call from a State security police officer, who informed her that her husband was in a hotel with “them”. No information could be obtained on the reasons of the detention and on the possible date of Mr. Chen’s release. The Observatory was further informed that prior to this arrest, three other organisers, Messrs. Liao Suangyuan, Huang Yanming and Du Heping, had already “disappeared”. Mr. Liao’s wife recently received a message stating that he had been taken to a “wildlife refuge” and that he would not return before December 10, 2008. The Observatory expresses its deep concern with these enforced disappearances and arbitrary detentions, which are evidence of the determination of the Chinese authorities to silence human rights defenders, in flagrant violation of the provisions of the United Nations (UN) Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998 and of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), which the five human rights activists were aiming to commemorate. Two days ahead of the celebration of the 60th Anniversary of the UDHR, the Observatory calls upon the Chinese authorities to stop harassment of human rights defenders and to create a conducive environment to the development of their activities. The Observatory further points out that in April 2006, the PRC submitted a document to the UN in order to support its candidacy to the Human Rights Council’s first election, in which it affirmed that amendment had been made to the Constitution to aim at “defining the position of human rights in the overall national development strategy”, and that as a member of the Human Rights Council, the PRC “shall uphold the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights”. Actions required: Please write to the Chinese authorities urging them to:   Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Messrs. Chen Xi, Shen Youlian, Liao Suangyuan, Huang Yanming and Du Heping;  Take prompt action in order to locate Messrs. Chen Xi, Shen Youlian, Liao Suangyuan, Huang Yanming and Du Heping, make public their whereabouts, and ensure their immediate release;  Put an end to all acts of harassment, including at the judicial level, against them as well as all other human rights defenders in China;  Conform with Article 33.3 of the Chinese Constitution that states that “the State respects and safeguards human rights”;  Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, article 6(b), which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others (...) to publish, impart or disseminate to others views, information and knowledge on all human rights and fundamental freedoms”, and its article 8(2), which provides that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to submit to governmental bodies and agencies and organisations concerned with public affairs criticism and proposals for improving their functioning and to draw attention to any aspect of their work that may hinder or impede the promotion, protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms”;  Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by the People’s Republic of China.
