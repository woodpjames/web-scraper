The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a
partnership of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and FIDH, has
received new information and requests your urgent intervention in the following
situation in Egypt.
 
New information:
 
The Observatory has been
informed by reliable sources about the ongoing arbitrary detention of Ms. Amal Fathy despite an order to release her on bail issued with regards
to one of the two criminal cases pending against her. Ms. Amal Fathy is a woman human rights
defender known for being vocal against human rights violations, in particular the
arbitrary detention of activists in Egypt. She is married to Mr. Mohamed
Lotfy, Executive Director of the Egyptian Commission for Rights
and Freedoms (ECRF) and a former member of the now banned “April 6 Youth
Movement”.
 
According to the information received, on June 21, 2018, the Criminal
Court of South Cairo approved the release on bail of Ms. Amal Fathy within the
framework of Case No. 7991 of 2018 upon payment of a 10’000 EGP guarantee (approximately
480 EUR), rejecting the Maadi Prosecutor’s appeal against the release order
which had been issued on June 19, 2018 by the Helwan Misdemeanour Appeals'
Court. Under this case, Ms. Amal Fathy is accused of “broadcasting a video
harming national security”, “posting a video inciting to overthrow the regime
and spreading false rumors”, and “misusing social media”. These charges stem
from a 12-minute video released on May 9, 2018, on Facebook in which Ms. Amal Fathy criticises the Egyptian Government
for failing to protect women against sexual harassment as well as over a general
deterioration in living conditions in the country.
 
Ms. Amal Fathy remains nonetheless in
detention pending investigation within the framework of Case No. 621 of 2018,
under which she is accused of “joining a terrorist group”, “publishing false
news to disrupt public security and harm national interests” and “using the
internet to call for acts of terrorism” (see background information).
 
The Observatory strongly
condemns the ongoing arbitrary detention and judicial harassment of Ms. Amal
Fathy, which seem to merely aim at punishing her for her peaceful and
legitimate human rights activities and those of her husband, Mr. Mohamed Lotfy.
Indeed, this is not the first time that ECRF and its members are subjected to
harassment, due to their documentation of cases of torture in prisons, enforced
disappearances as well as their legal support in Giulio Regeni’s case. The raid
on Mr. Mohamed Lotfy’s house and the arrest of his wife Ms. Amal Fathy actually
took place one week before the visit of the Italian technical team to review
video footage in connection with the 2016 torture and killing of the Italian
researcher.
 
The Observatory urges the Egyptian
authorities to release Ms. Amal Fathy immediately
and unconditionally and to put an end to all forms of harassment against her,
including at the judicial level.
 
Background information:
 
On May 9, 2018, Ms. Amal
Fathy posted a 12-minute video on Facebook
criticising the Egyptian Government for its failure to protect women against
sexual harassment as well as over a general deterioration in living
conditions in the country.
 
The next day, pro-government and State-owned
media outlets released articles citing the video, identifying Ms. Amal Fathy as
an “April 6 Youth movement” activist, the wife of Mr. Mohamed Lotfy and
accusing her of insulting Egypt and Egyptian institutions. This was followed by
a wave of harassment and threats on social media against Ms. Amal Fathy.
 
On May 11, 2018, at around 2.30 am, Egyptian
security forces raided the house of Ms. Amal Fathy and Mr. Mohamed Lotfy in
Cairo and started searching it. Their mobile phones were seized and they were
denied the right to communicate with a lawyer or their relatives. The two
activists were brought to Maadi police station, in southern Cairo, along with their
three-year-old son.
 
Around three hours later, Mr. Lotfy and his
son were released. The Maadi Prosecutor subsequently placed Ms. Amal Fathy
under preventive detention for 15 days within the framework of Criminal case No. 7991 of
2018.
 
On May 12, 2018, Ms. Amal Fathy was transferred to Qanater women’s prison. 
 
On May 13, 2018, Ms. Amal Fathy was questioned
by the High State Security Prosecution about the “April 6 Youth Movement”, ECRF and the
activities of her husband. She was then placed under preventive detention for
an additional 15 days in the framework of another case, Criminal case No.
621 of 2018.
 
On May 24, the Maadi
Prosecutor extended Ms. Amal Fathy’s preventive detention for 15 additional
days within the framework of Case No. 7991 of 2018, without providing reason.
Ms. Fathy appealed the decision. On May 30, 2018, Ms. Fathy’s appeal was rejected. 
 
On June 7, 2018, the Maadi Prosecutor extended for the third time Ms.
Amal Fathy’s preventive detention for a further 2-week period, without providing any reason.

Mr. Mohamed Lotfy and
