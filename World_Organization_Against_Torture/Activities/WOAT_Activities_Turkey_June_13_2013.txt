While the police
continued to violently crackdown on peaceful demonstrations on Taksim Square
and in Gezi Park, a fourth person died in the protests and over 50 lawyers have
been arrested while protesting in an Istanbul courthouse. In addition, Turkish
citizens, human rights defenders, trade unions and civil society organisations
continue to be under attack by the Turkish government.
 
Yesterday, the
European Parliament discussed the current situation in Turkey in the plenary
debate in Strasbourg and formulated the following demands to end the violence,
including:
 
·      The Turkish
authorities must guarantee and respect the rights of all citizens to freedom of
expression, peaceful assembly and peaceful protest; immediately release all
peaceful protestors taken into custody and currently detained; allow all
detainees unrestricted access to lawyers of their choice; provide information
on the exact numbers of detainees and injured;
 
·      The role of a system
of checks and balances is crucial in the governance of a modern democratic
state, which should be reflected in the ongoing constitutional process, and
which must be based on the principle of separation of powers, with balance
between the executive, legislative and judicial functions, on respect for human
rights and fundamental freedoms – in particular freedom of expression and
freedom of the press – and on a participatory political culture that truly
reflects the plurality of a democratic society; in itself, the organisation of
peaceful and legitimate protests testifies to the vibrancy of Turkish civil
society; continuing efforts are important to Turkey to further improve its
democratic institutions, the rule of law and the observance of fundamental
freedoms;
 
·      Freedom of expression
and media pluralism are at the heart of European values and a truly democratic,
free and pluralist society requires true freedom of expression; freedom of
expression is applicable not only to information or ideas that are favourably
received or regarded as inoffensive, but also, in accordance with the European
Convention on Human Rights, to those that offend, shock or disturb the state or
any section of the population.
 
SOLIDAR, İnsan
Hakları Derneği (İHD), Euro-Mediterranean
Human Rights Network and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) welcome these demands as they coincide
with the joint draft
resolution issued last week, supported by the EPAN working group of CONCORD and DVV
International.
 
In light of these resolutions, we urge the European
Commission and the European External Action Service (EEAS) to engage in close
dialogue with Turkey on crucial issues such as the judiciary and fundamental
rights, especially through chapters 23 (Judiciary and Fundamental Rights) and
24 (Justice, Freedom and Security) as part of the Accession
Partnership as they provide an important policy tool to put pressure
on the Turkish government to ensure that all national legislation related to
human rights and fundamental freedoms is in line with the essential values of
the EU and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and
Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR).
