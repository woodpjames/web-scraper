Kengadharan, V. Ganabatirau and T. VasanthakumarNew information MYS 002 / 0408 / OBS 061.1 Arbitrary detention / Concern for the health condition Malaysia February 11, 2009 The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), has received new information and requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in Malaysia. New information: The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the dismissal by the Federal Court of the habeas corpus application lodged by Mr. P. Uthayakumar, legal adviser of the Hindu Rights Action Force (HINDRAF), an NGO defending the rights of the Indian minority in Malaysia, as well as by Messrs. M. Manoharan, R. Kengadharan, V. Ganabatirau, three lawyers, and T. Vasanthakumar, HINDRAF organising secretary. According to the information received, on February 11, 2009, the Federal Court dismissed the five HINDRAF leaders’ motion for review of their habeas corpus application. Justice Nik Hashim Nik Ab Rahman, who was leading a three-member panel, said the decision to dismiss the motion was a unanimous one. The panel also agreed with the findings of Kuala Lumpur High Court judicial commissioner Zainal Aznam Abdul Aziz, who stated that the Prime Minister could order a person to be detained under Section 8 of the Internal Security Act (ISA) without waiting for full investigation by the police. The Observatory recalls that Messrs. P. Uthayakumar, M. Manoharan, R. Kenghadharan, V. Ganabatirau and T. Vasanthakumar were arrested on December 13, 2007 in Kuala Lumpur by Special Branch police officers under Section 8 (1) of ISA, which allows the person to be placed in administrative detention for up to two years. Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, who was then also Internal Security Minister, had ordered for their detention, subsequent to a mass rally HINDRAF had organised on November 25, 2007 in Kuala Lumpur[1]. As of issuing this urgent appeal, Messrs. P. Uthayakumar, M. Manoharan, R. Kenghadharan, V. Ganabatirau and T. Vasanthakumar remained in detention at the Kemta Prison, Kamunting, Perak. The Observatory considers the detention of these five HINDRAF leaders as arbitrary insofar as it seems to merely sanction their human rights activities. The Observatory also expresses its deep concern about their conditions of detention, and is especially worried by Mr. P. Uthayakumar’s health condition, a diabetic suffering from heart problems, who has had no access to necessary medical treatment. The Observatory further recalls that Malaysia was elected to the United Nations Human Rights Council in June 2006 for three years and is committed in this regard to “uphold the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights”[2]. Background information: On January 24, 25 and 28, 2008, the High Court of Kuala Lumpur heard a legal challenge to the ongoing detention of Messrs. P. Uthayakumar, M. Manoharan, R. Kenghadharan, V. Ganabatirau and T. Vasanthakumar. At the end of the hearing, the court said it would issue its judgment on February 26, 2008. On that date, the Kuala Lumpur High Court rejected their habeas corpus applications. On February 26, 2008, the lawyers of the five HINDRAF members filed an appeal, which was dismissed on May 14, 2008. On August 4, 2008, their lawyers filed a new habeas corpus appeal at the Apex Court following the lodging of a case before the Ipoh High Court[3]. This appeal is still pending.
