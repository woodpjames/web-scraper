During the last five years, at least 2.300 children in at least 35 countries were victims of torture, summary executions, forced disappearances and arbitrary arrest.   On several occasions, the national justice system remains inactive or, if there is an investigation, the pace and the procedures of the investigations reveal deficiencies and a lack of impartiality in the system. This cycle of violation and impunity is likely to be perpetuated at the international level, where there is no specific mechanism to address violence against children.  The panel will consist of: Judge Frank Orlando(ret) Director, DCI/International Network on Juvenile Justice Ms Marie Wernham, Advocacy Officer, Consortium for Street Children, UK Mr Peter Newell, Co-ordinator, EPOCH-WORLDWIDE Mr Paulo David, Secretariat of the Committee on the Rights of the Child Mr Eric Sottas, Director of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT)   ********************************************************************** For more information please contact: OMCT, Roberta Cecchetti, +41-22-809 49 39
