Brief description of the situation   The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Fond za hamanitarno pravo (Humanitarian Law Center), a member of the OMCT network, about a case of policy brutality in Raška, Sandžak region. In their statements to the HLC and the Sandžak Human Rights Committee, Milan Janoševiæ (23) and Dragan Jelenkoviæ (24) alleged that they were physically abused by two Raška police officers on 9 June this year.   According to the information received the two men were in a sidewalk cafe about midnight. Milan Janoševiæ car was parked nearby with the music playing. Officers Ivan Simiæ and Slobodan Djuroviæ came up to him, told him to turn the music off, present his ID card and go with them.  When Janoševiæ refused to go, Officer Simiæ struck him on the forehead with his nightstick.  The frightened Janoševiæ broke away and ran, finding a hiding place under a bridge.  A local police inspector coming from the opposite direction saw him and told the two officers where Janoševiæ was hiding.    According to Janoševiæ, the two policemen reached him a few minutes later and pointed their flashlights and guns at him.  They ordered him to lie down and put his hands on his back, and held him down with their knees while they cuffed him.   "One of their guns went off, accidentally I think.  My friends in town heard the shot.  I said I would sue if they beat me again.  After cuffing me, they started hitting me on the back with their nightsticks, both of them.  The beating was worst, right there under the bridge, next to the retaining wall.  They hit me on the back and chest, and then threw me into the stream with my hands still cuffed.  The policeman Simiæ grabbed the back of my neck and pushed my head into the water.  "So, you're going to sue us, are you" he kept saying, and I said I wouldn't, hoping to be let go.  Inspector Kurandiæ watched what was happening from the bridge but did nothing.  They went on kicking me and then threw me hard against the retaining wall which had steel reinforcement rods sticking out of it.  Two of the rods gored me in the back.  This treatment lasted about 15 minutes.  Leading me from there to the car, some 50 meters away, they hit me more than 20 times, and threw me to the ground four times," Janoševiæ told an HLC researcher.    Janoševiæ was held at the local police station for several hours, during which time he was taken twice to the Medical Center for an anti-tetanus shot and have his injuries treated.  He was interviewed by the station commander, Boško Niæiforoviæ, in the presence of Inspector Kurandiæ who said to Janoševiæ: "You owe me a drink for saving you."  Meeting later with Janoševiæ and his father, the station commander tried to play down the incident, excusing his officers' conduct with the fact that they had been transferred from Kosovo.    As for Dragan Jelenkoviæ, he saw Officer Simiæ strike Janoševiæ on the back outside the cafe, after which the officer turned around and hit Jelenkoviæ twice on the head with his nightstick.  When Jelenkoviæ went to the police station to complain, he met Milan Janoševiæ's father there.  Both insisted that the two officers be subjected to a blood alcohol test.  Jelenkoviæ was told to file a complaint with the duty officer, Zoran Jovanoviæ, who was in a room connected with another office in which Officer Ivan Simiæ was sitting.  The two policemen consulted briefly, after which Jovanoviæ told Jelenkoviæ that criminal charges would be pressed against him and that a statement would be taken from him.   Jelenkoviæ told the HLC that the Kraljevo Police Chief called his father the next day and apologized for the Raška police, saying Officer Simiæ had admitted to him that he struck Jelenkoviæ in a moment of anger.    On 25 June 2003, the Sandžak Human Rights Committee filed a criminal complaint against Officers Simiæ and Djuroviæ, charging them with civil injury and infliction of slight bodily harm.  Janoševiæ and Jelenkoviæ have medical certificates and photographs of their injuries.    A criminal complaint was filed earlier against Officer Slobodan Djuroviæ.  In his statement, Fuad Dizdareviæ of Novi Pazar described how Djuroviæ physically abused him at a checkpoint in Rudnica village, threatened to shoot him in the mouth, and burn down his house and force him to move out.  In the presence of several other police, Djuroviæ cocked his pistol and, pushing it to Dizdareviæ's throat under the chin, said in a threatening tone: "Now, are you going to report me?"
