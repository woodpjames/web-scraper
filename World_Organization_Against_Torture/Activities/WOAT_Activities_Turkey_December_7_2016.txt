The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights
Defenders, a partnership of FIDH and the World Organisation Against Torture
(OMCT), requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in Turkey.
 
Description of the situation:
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about
the arbitrary detention of Ms. Seher
Acay, representative of the Mardin Branch of the Human Rights
Association (IHD), as well as of Mr. Fevzi Adsiz, Mr. Ziya Baği, and
Mr. Mahmut Bingöl, members of IHD. The four lawyers are also affiliated
to the Association of Jurists of Mesopotamia (MHD)[1].
 
According to the information
received, on November 21, 2016, the four human rights lawyers were arrested and
have been detained since then at the headquarters of the anti-terror police in
the city of Mardin, on the basis of an arbitrary decision issued by Public
Prosecutor Vural Eker. As of issuing this Urgent Appeal, the four detainees
have not had access to their lawyers and no formal charges have yet been filed
against them. However, the local press has reported that their arrest and
detention would be linked to their activities as counsels of the city of
Mardin, the mayor of which as been detained since November 21, 2016, on
accusations of being linked to the PKK.
 
In addition, it has been reported
that the four lawyers are being held in a department together with 186 persons,
and are more specifically detained with five other individuals in a cell
designed for two persons. As a result, the nine cannot lie down and rest as the
cell is too crowded. Besides, they have been denied the right to undergo a
medical checkup in the jail, and the prison doctor was reportedly summonsed to
the Anti-Terror Headquarters in relation with their case. So far, the President
of the Mardin Bar Association Celebi Araz visited them in jail, but they have
been denied access to the legal counsel of their choice.
 
The Observatory strongly condemns
the arrest and detention of Ms. Seher Acay, Mr. Mahmut Bingöl,
Mr. Fevzi Adsiz and Mr.
Ziya Baği and urges the Turkish authorities to immediately and unconditionally
release them as their detention appears to be a form of retaliation for their
human rights activities.
 
Until they are released, the
Observatory calls upon the Turkish authorities to ensure the physical and
psychological integrity of the four defenders as well as that any proceedings
against them are carried out in full compliance with their right to a fair
trial, as protected under international law, which includes access to their lawyers.
