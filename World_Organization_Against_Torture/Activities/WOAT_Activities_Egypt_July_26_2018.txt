Arbitrary
detention / 
Judicial harassment
Egypt
July 26, 2018
 
The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a
partnership of FIDH and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), has
received new information and requests your intervention in the following
situation in Egypt.

New information:
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the pursuit
of the arbitrary detention of Dr. Shadi al-Ghazali Harb, human rights
defender known for his role as a youth activist and leader in the 2011
revolution. 
 
According to the information received, on July 25, 2018, the pre-trial
detention of Dr. Shadi al-Ghazali Harb,
has again been renewed for 15 days. Dr. Shadi al-Ghazali Harb has been
arbitrarily detained since May 15, 2018, and his pre-trial detention has
already been renewed six times. He is being accused of “joining a group
established in violation to the provisions of the law and the constitution with
the aim to disrupt state institutions, spread false news, and humiliate the
President” (see background information).

Dr. Shadi al-Ghazali Harb, held in solitary confinement at Qanater prison since
the beginning of his detention, has been transferred to a new cell last week.
According to the same information received, the conditions of detention of Dr.
Shadi al-Ghazali Harb have deteriorated. His new cell is very dirty, hot, and
no ventilation is available.
 
The Observatory recalls that Dr. Shadi al-Ghazali Harb’s detention
occurs within a new wave of arrests targeting human rights defenders in Egypt
since May 2018, including Ms. Amal Fathy[1],
Mr. Wael Abbas[2]
and Mr. Haytham Mohamadein[3],
all detained on trumped up terrorism-related charges.
 
The Observatory condemns in the strongest terms this renewed crackdown
targeting human rights defenders, and urges the Egyptian authorities to
immediately and unconditionally release Dr. Shadi al-Ghazali Harb, as well as
Ms. Amal Fathy, Mr. Wael Abbas and Mr. Haytham Mohamadein, as their detention is
arbitrary since it only aims at sanctioning their human rights activities.
Until then, the Observatory calls on the Egyptian authorities to guarantee the
psychological and physical integrity of the above-mentioned human rights
defenders.
 
The Observatory more generally urges the Egyptian authorities to put an
end to all forms of harassment against them, including at the judicial level,
and to refrain from further punishing their peaceful and legitimate human
rights activities under trumped up, terrorism-related charges.
 
Background information: 
 
On May 15, 2018, Dr. Shadi al-Ghazali Harb was arrested after he
presented himself to the office of the general prosecution in Giza where he had
been summoned by a warrant from the North Giza Court. Although he was initially
granted a 50,000 EGP bail (approx. 2,400 Euros), he was then transferred to the
Dokki police station where he was detained overnight. 
 
On May 16, 2018 the State Security Prosecution ordered his detention for
15 days pending investigation into charges of case no. 621 of 2018, which is
targeting a number of human rights defenders, bloggers and online activists. 
 
Dr. Shadi al-Ghazali Harb is being detained in solitary confinement at
Qanater prison, where he does not have regular access to his family and
lawyers. During the first 15 days of his detention, he was even denied access
to a bed and he was not allowed to go outdoors.
 
Actions requested:
 
Please write to the authorities of Egypt asking them to:
 
i.               
Guarantee in all circumstances the
physical and psychological integrity of Dr. Shadi al-Ghazali Harb, Ms. Amal
Fathy, Mr. Wael Abbas and Mr. Haytham Mohamadein, their relatives and
all human rights defenders in Egypt;
 
ii.              
Immediately and unconditionally
release Dr. Shadi al-Ghazali Harb, Ms. Amal Fathy, Mr. Wael Abbas and
Mr. Haytham Mohamadein as their detention is arbitrary as it is merely
aimed at punishing them for their human rights activities;
 
iii.             
Put an end to all acts of
harassment, including at the judicial level, against Dr. Shadi al-Ghazali Harb,
Ms. Amal Fathy, Mr. Wael Abbas and Mr. Haytham Mohamadein and all
human rights defenders in Egypt, and ensure that they are able to carry out
their activities without hindrance;
 
iv.            
Conform with the provisions of the
UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of
the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially Articles 1, 6(c) and 12.2;
and
 
v.             
More generally, ensure in all
circumstances the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in
accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with
international and regional human rights instruments ratified by Egypt.
