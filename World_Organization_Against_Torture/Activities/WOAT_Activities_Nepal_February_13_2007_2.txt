New Information The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Informal Sector Service Center  (INSEC), a member of the SOS-Torture network, that the 29 persons, who were arrested along with Mr. Primatan Bahadur Gurung on 13 January 2006, were released a week later after their arrest. However, as regards Mr. Gurung’s death, no investigation was launched by the relevant authorities and no compensation provided to the family accordingly. OMCT welcomes the release of the 29 persons. However, OMCT is gravely concerned that no investigation has been launched into the death of Mr. Gurung. Reminder of the situation According to the information received, Mr Pritam Bahadur Gurung was arrested along with 29 other people of the village development committee of Manakamana, Syangja district. Security forces arrested the 30 individuals after an incident of cross firing between security forces and Maoists on 12 and 13 January 2006. Mr. Gurung was released in the afternoon of the following day. During his detention, he was allegedly beaten and kept in a cold bunker the whole night. It is worth noting that Mr. Gurung suffered from asthma. After his release, Mr. Gurung was brought by his son and neighbours to the Gandaki Zonal Hospital for treatment. On 29 January 2006, a fact-finding team from the Human Rights Treaty Monitoring Coordination Committee (HRTMCC) met with Mr. Gurung, who died an hour later, allegedly due to the bad conditions of his detention. The International Secretariat has no additional information about the 29 other suspects. Action Requested Please write a letter to the authorities in Nepal urging them to:  Order a thorough and impartial investigation into the death of Mr. Gurung, in order to identify all those responsible, bring them to trial and apply the penal and/or administrative sanctions as provided by law; Guarantee that adequate compensation is awarded to Mr. Gurung’s family; Guarantee the respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
