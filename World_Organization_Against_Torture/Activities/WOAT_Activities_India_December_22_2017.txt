The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a partnership of the
World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and FIDH, requests your urgent
intervention in the following situation in India.
 
Brief description of the
information:
 
The
Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about obstacles to freedom of
movement and
subsequent deportation of Mr. Mukunda Raj
Kattel, Director of the Regional Secretariat of the Asian
Forum for Human Rights and Development (Forum-Asia)[1],
based in Bangkok, Thailand.
 
According
to the information received, on December 20, 2017, around 12am, Mr. Mukunda Raj
Kattel was detained
by the immigration department upon his arrival at Trichirapalli International Airport,
Tamil Nadu State, India. No reason was given for his detention.
 
Mr. Mukunda Raj Kattel was travelling to
India to visit friends during his Christmas holidays, including Mr. Henri Tiphagne, Executive Director of
People’s Watch, member of OMCT’s Executive Committee and former Chairperson of
Forum-Asia. It is worth mentioning that as a Nepali citizen, Mr. Kattel does not require a visa to
enter India.
 
Mr.
Kattel was subsequently informed that he would
be deported back to Thailand. During his detention, he was not allowed to meet
with a lawyer.
 
At around 10.30pm on
December 20, 2017, Mr. Mukunda Raj Kattel was deported back to Thailand
via Malaysia after being detained for more than 18 hours by the immigration department
at Trichirapalli International Airport.
 
The Observatory strongly
condemns Mr. Mukunda Kattel’s arbitrary arrest and subsequent
deportation, which seems to only aim at sanctioning his legitimate human rights
activities in the region, and calls upon the Indian
authorities to guarantee in all circumstances the freedoms of movement,
peaceful assembly and association of all human
rights defenders in India.
 
Actions
requested: 
 
Please write to the authorities in India, urging them to:
 
i. Guarantee,
in all circumstances, the freedom of movement of Mr. Mukunda Raj Kattel and of all human rights
defenders in India;
 
ii. Put an
end to any harassment against all human rights defenders in India, and ensure
in all circumstances that they are able to carry out their legitimate
activities without any hindrance and fear of reprisals;
 
iii.
Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders,
adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, in
particular with Articles 1, 5(b) and 12.2;
 
iv.
Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms
in accordance with international human rights standards and international
instruments ratified by India.
