The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint
programme of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World
Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), has received new information and requests
your urgent intervention in the following situation in South Korea.
New information:
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the
continued judicial harassment of Mr. Lae-Goon Park, a standing steering
committee member of the Coalition 4.16 on the Sewol Ferry Disaster[1]
(Coalition 4.16), as well as Ms. Hye-Jin Kim, a staff member of the Coalition 4.16, and Messrs. Hyung-Jae
Ham and Hyun-Sik Kim, two staff members from the People's
Committee for the Sewol Tragedy.
According to the information received, on January 22,
2016, the Seoul
Central District Court will announce a verdict against Mr. Park and Ms. Kim,
who face five years and three years in prison respectively for charges related
to their participation in a series of protests in 2014 and 2015 related to the
Sewol Ferry incident (see background information). On December 15, 2015 the
Seoul Prosecutor's Office had requested the Court to sentence Mr. Park and Ms.
Kim to these prison sentences. Mr. Park and Ms. Kim's lawyers are planning to
submit defence arguments and additional views before the January 22 hearing. 
Mr. Park and Ms. Kim are both facing charges
under Article 6 (“organizing illegal rallies”) and Article 20 (“refusal to be
dispersed”) of the Assembly and Demonstration Act and Article 185 (“general
obstruction of traffic”) of the Criminal Code. Mr. Park is facing the following
additional charges: Article 141 (“invalidity of public documents” and
“destruction of public goods”), Article 144 (“special obstruction of public
duty”) and Article 307 (“defamation”) of the Criminal Code. 
In addition, six other people who participated in Sewol protests in
April and May 2015, including Messrs. Hyung-Jae
Ham and Hyun-Sik Kim(two
staff members from the People's Committee for the Sewol Tragedy) were
detained for alleged acts of violence during the protests and then released.[2]
On July 14, 2015, the Seoul Prosecutor's office indicted Messrs. Ham and Kimunder Article 185 of the Criminal Code, for which they faced three years in
prison. On August 11, 2015, a lower court sentenced Messrs. Ham and Kim
respectively to eight months in prison with two years of probation and six
months in prison with one year of probation respectively. Both Messrs. Kim and
Ham appealed their sentences; the first appeal hearing was held on December 17,
2015. The final decision of the Appeal Court is expected to be announced on
January 28, 2016.
The Observatory expresses its utmost concern over the
continued judicial harassment against Messrs. Park, Ham, Kim and Ms. Kim, and
calls on the South Korean authorities to drop all charges against them and put
an end to all acts of judicial harassment against them and other human rights
defenders in South Korea.
The Observatory is concerned by the ongoing attempts
by the South Korean authorities to curtail freedom of association, assembly,
and expression, which seem to be aimed at undermining the legitimate activities
of human rights defenders. The Observatory recalls that the South Korean
authorities have the responsibility to ensure the protection of human rights in
general and of rights related to freedoms of expression, assembly and
association in particular.
Background information:
After the Sewol ferry disaster on April 16, 2014, families of victims
and civil society organizations have continuously urged the Government to set
up an independent investigatory commission to reveal the truth regarding the
Sewol ferry disaster. The People’s Committee for the Sewol Ferry Tragedy,
together with Sewol victims' families, collected more than 3.5 million
individual signatures calling for the enactment of a law to establish an
independent and transparent investigation commission on the Sewol ferry disaster
and submitted these signatures to the National Assembly on July 15, 2014. 
After the submission, some victims' families, individual citizens, and
human rights defenders including Mr. Lae-goon Park, went on hunger strike,
demonstrated overnight in the street, and shaved their heads in protest calling
for enactment of a Special Law on Sewol. The Special Law for Seeking Truth of
the Sewol Ferry Disaster and Establishing Safer Society (Sewol Special Law) was
finally enacted on November 7, 2014.
However, on March 27, 2015, the government announced an enforcement
ordinance for the Sewol Special Law which human rights defenders say runs
counter to the provisions of the law and risks denying the rights of victims
and families to truth. The members of Coalition 4.16 therefore organised
a series of protests to call for the abolishment of the enforcement decree and
to commemorate Sewol victims and call for a truly independent and transparent
investigation into the tragedy. During these protests in April and May 2015,
physical clashes between protesters and police occurred and violence broke out.
On July 17, 2015, Mr. Park was detained by the Seoul Metropolitan Police
in connection to his participation in a series of protests in 2014 and 2015
related to the the Sewol Ferry incident.[3]
Police agents claimed that Mr. Park incited sedition during these protests and
colluded with other human rights defenders to take violent action against the
police. According to Coalition 4.16, no conclusive evidence has been provided
for Mr. Park’s involvement in inciting violent acts during the protests. To the
contrary, Coalition 4.16 has stated that Mr. Park tried to calm participants
during the protests and asked them not to use any violence against authorities.
On November 2, 2015, Mr. Park was released on bail.
Actions requested: 

The Observatory urges the authorities of South Korea to:

with others to meet or assemble peacefully” ; and

threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or

[1]               After the Sewol
ferry tragedy, South Korean civil society organizations established a network
of more than 800 NGOs called the “People’s Committee for the Sewol Ferry
Tragedy.” This Committee supported the Sewol victims’ families in their pursuit
of the truth regarding the Sewol ferry tragedy. After the Special Law for
Seeking Truth of the Sewol Ferry Disaster and Establishing Safer Society
was enacted at the end of 2014, the Committee was transformed into the “Coalition
4.16 on the Sewol Ferry Disaster” (Coalition 4.16), which also includes the
membership of the Sewol families and individual supporters. The Coalition 4.16
has three standing steering committee members, one from each of these groups,
and Mr. Park is one of them. Since then, most activities, including protests,
have been organized under the Coalition 4.16’s name to show that families,
civil society organisations, and individual supporters are jointly working
towards truth regarding the Sewol ferry incident.


[2]               The four other
protesters are Mr. Chang-Gun Kim, Mr. Jang-Hee Kwon, Mr. Kwang-Chul Kang and
Mr. Gi-Ho Lee. The four deny having engaged in violence during the protests. 


[3]               The protests for
which Mr. Park was being detained were held on July 24, 2014, to commemorate
the 100 days since the Sewol ferry tragedy; on April 11, 2015, to call for the
raising of the Sewol ferry; on April 16, 2015, to commemorate the one year
anniversary of the Sewol ferry tragedy; on April 18, 2015, to call for truth
regarding the Sewol ferry tragedy; and on May 1 and 2, 2015, as an overnight
protest to call for truth-seeking in the Sewol ferry tragedy.
