The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint
programme of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World
Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), has received new information and requests
your urgent intervention in the following situation in Bahrain.
New information:
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the arrest of
Mr. Nabeel Rajab,
President of the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights (BCHR) and FIDH Deputy
Secretary General.
According to the information received, in the morning of June 13, 2016,
police forces reportedly led by the Cybercrime Unit arrested Mr. Nabeel Rajab,
after raiding his house and seizing a number of electronic devices.
On June 13 in the afternoon, Mr. Rajab was able to contact his wife by
phone, and reported being detained at East Riffa Police Station. As of issuing
this urgent appeal, he would have been transferred to the Public Prosecution,
but the specific reasons behind his arrest or the existence of new charges
against the latter remain unclear. 
The Observatory denounces the new arrest of Mr. Nabeel Rajab, which
seems to be yet another evidence of a long-standing pattern of harassment
against him in an attempt to sanction his human rights activities (see
background information). 
The Observatory further highlights that his arrest took place on the
first day of the 32nd session of the United Nations (UN) Human
Rights Council in Geneva, in a context where other five human rights activists[1] were
stopped by Immigration, Passport, and Residency officials
at the Bahrain International Airport on June 12, as they were about to board
their plane to Geneva, and were informed that they were banned from traveling[2].
The Observatory calls upon the Bahraini authorities to immediately and
unconditionally release Mr. Nabeel Rajab, to put an end to any act of
harassment against him and in general against all human rights defenders in
Bahrain and to comply with relevant international human rights standards and
instruments, in particular the International Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights of 1966, and the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by
the UN General Assembly on December 9, 1998.
Background information:
Mr. Rajab has faced continuous judicial harassment for his
legitimate human rights work since his first arrest in June 2012.
Mr. Rajab was sentenced to three months imprisonment for allegedly
libelling the residents of Al Muharraq via several tweets posted on his twitter
account. On August 23, 2012, Mr. Nabeel Rajab was acquitted by the Higher
Appeal Court.
On August 16, 2012, the Lower Criminal Court sentenced Mr. Nabeel
Rajab to three years of imprisonment in relation to three cases related to his
participation in peaceful gatherings in favour of fundamental freedoms and
democracy. In December 2012, the Appeals Court reduced the sentence to two
years of imprisonment. Mr. Nabeel Rajab completed his sentence and was
released in May 2014.
On October 1, 2014, Mr. Nabeel Rajab was summoned and remanded in
detention by the General Directorate of Anti-corruption and Economic and
Electronic Security of the Criminal Investigation Department for “insulting a
public institution” under Article 216 of the Bahraini Penal Code. The case
related to a
tweet he published in September 2014, in which he
criticised the military institutions for generating extremist ideologies (the
“terrorism tweet” case). On November 2, 2014, the Third Lower Criminal Court
ordered Mr. Rajab’s release but barred him from leaving the country.
On January 20, 2015, the Third Lower Criminal Court sentenced Mr. Nabeel
Rajab to six months imprisonment on the charges of “insulting public
institutions and the army”. 
In 2015, two other sets of criminal charges have been brought against
Mr. Rajab. On February 26, 2015, Mr. Rajab was summoned for investigations
for charges of “inciting hatred towards the regime” in relation to a speech he
made in February 2011 during a funeral (the “funeral speech case”). To date,
the police investigation is ongoing.
In addition, on April 2, 2015, at 4:00 pm, over twenty police cars
surrounded Mr. Rajab’s house and policemen arrested him. Mr. Rajab
was then sent to the General Directorate of Anti Corruption Economic and
Electronic Security to be interrogated and placed in detention in solitary
confinement in Isa Town Police Station. On April 3, 2015, Mr. Rajab was
interrogated by the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) regarding two new
charges brought against him under criminal case No.
2015/38288. The first charge was “insulting a statutory body” (Article
216 of the Bahraini Criminal Code) referring to the Ministry of Interior in
relation to tweets he posted denouncing the torture of detainees at Jaw Prison
(the “Jaw torture tweets” case). The second charge was “disseminating false
rumours in time of war” (Article 133 of the Bahraini Criminal Code) in relation
to tweets he published about the Saudi-Arabia led coalition air strikes in
Yemen (the “Yemen tweets” case). If sentenced on the second charge,
Mr. Rajab could be facing up to 10 years imprisonment. Mr. Rajab
refused to sign the police minutes of the investigations. On April 4, 2015,
Mr. Rajab was brought before the Public Prosecution. The Prosecution
ordered seven days detention pending investigation. On April 5, 2015, security
police confiscated all electronics devices belonging to Mr. Rajab and
members of his family.
On April 11, 2015, the prosecution ordered an additional fifteen days in
detention for Mr. Rajab. On April 26, 2015, the Public Prosecution
officially charged Mr. Rajab under Articles 133 and 216. The Public
Prosecution subsequently extended his detention for an additional fifteen days.
On May 11, the Bahraini High Court extended Nabeel Rajab´s preventive detention
for 15 days.
On May 14, 2015, the Bahrain Criminal Court of Appeal upheld the six-month
prison sentence (the “terrorism tweet” case). 
On July 13, 2015, the King of Bahrain Hamad Ben Issa Al-Khalifa ordered
through Royal Pardon the release of Mr. Nabeel Rajab for health reasons. Mr.
Rajab had already served three of the six months jail sentence. Moreover, on
the same date, the Public Prosecution imposed a travel ban against Mr. Rajab in
relation to criminal case No. 2015/38288 related to the Jaw torture and Yemen
tweets cases.
Mr. Rajab’s lawyers subsequently filed appeals against the travel ban
with the investigating prosecutor on September 2, 2015, with the Attorney
General on September 16, and with the Office of the Public Prosecution on
October 1, 2015. They received no response to such petitions. On December 3,
2015, Mr. Rajab's lawyers submitted another petition to the Attorney General
requesting the lift of the travel ban imposed on Mr. Nabeel Rajab on July 13,
2015. In the written request filed to the Attorney General, Mr. Rajab's lawyers
raised the issue of urgency, as Mr. Rajab's wife health is continuously
deteriorating and needs treatment outside of Bahrain, accompanied by Mr. Rajab.
This request has been disregarded.
Actions requested:
The Observatory urges the authorities of Bahrain to:
i. Release Mr. Nabeel Rajab immediately and unconditionally, as he

rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels” ;
 its Article 6 (c) which states that “everyone has the right, individually
and in association with others to study, discuss, form and hold opinions on the
observance, both in law and in practice, of all human rights and fundamental
freedoms and, through these and other appropriate means, to draw public
attention to those matters” ;
 and its Article 12.2 which states that “the State shall take all
necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of
everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence,
threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or
any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise
of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”.
