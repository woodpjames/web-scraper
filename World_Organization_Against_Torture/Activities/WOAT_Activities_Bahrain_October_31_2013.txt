The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights
Defenders, a joint programme of the International Federation for Human Rights
(FIDH) and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), has received new
information and requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in
Bahrain.
 
New information:
 
The Observatory has been informed by the Gulf Centre
for Human Rights and Bahrain Centre for Human Rights (BCHR) about intensified
judicial harassment faced by Mr. Mohammed Al-Maskati, President of the
Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights (BYSHR), and other members of BYSHR.
 
According to the information received, on October 22,
2013, Mr. Mohamed Al-Maskati was summoned to Al-Khamis Police Station where he
was interrogated on charges of “inciting hatred against the regime”, based on a
speech he made on September 8, 2013 in Jidhafs Town, where he spoke on the
concept of non-violence and the importance of peacefully demanding the respect
of rights as well as on the rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights (UDHR). He was released only after signing a pledge to appear
before the Public Prosecution upon request. The police investigation is
therefore ongoing.
 
The Observatory recalls that two other BYSHR members
are currently in detention. BYSHR co-founder and blogger Naji Fateel has
been detained since May 2013[1]
and was sentenced on September 29, 2013 to 15 years in prison for “the
establishment of a group for the purpose of disabling the constitution” under
Article 6 of the Terrorism Act. His trial on appeal is due to start on November
18, 2013. Mr. Hussain Abdulnabi has been in pre-trial detention since
September 6, 2013 on charges of “illegal gathering” and “rioting”. The next
hearing will take place on November 7, 2013.
 
The Observatory
condemns these acts of harassment against Mr. Al-Maskati and the arbitrary
detention of Messrs. Naji Fateel and Hussain Abdulnabi, which merely aim at
curtailing their human rights activities. The Observatory also notes that
several human rights defenders remain in arbitrary detention or are subject to
judicial harassment in the country. 
 
Background information :
 
On October 17, 2012, Mr. Al-Maskati appeared before
Bahrain’s public prosecution on charges of “participation in illegal protests”
in relation to a peaceful gathering held in Manama on October 12, 2012. He had
been summoned the day before to Al Hoora police station, where he had been kept
overnight before being referred to the prosecutor’s office. He was released on
bail on the same October 17, 2012 but charges against him have remained pending
since then. On June 19, 2013, Mr. Maskati appeared before the Lower Criminal
Court under these same charges Mr. Maskati's lawyers asked for the case file,
and the judge decided to adjourn the case to July 9, 2013 and then to December
9, 2013 .
 
Previously, on September 23, 2012, Mr. Al-Maskati and
other Bahraini human rights defenders who had cooperated with the United
Nations (UN) had received threats of reprisals while they were in Geneva to
participate in the 21st session of the UN Human Rights Council. Mr. Al-Maskati
was notably threatened with death through more than a dozen anonymous phone
calls.
 
Mr. Naji Fateel was arrested without warrant by
security men in civilian clothes at his home in the village of Bani-Jamra at
dawn of May 2, 2013 and held incommunicado for three days, during which time it
is reported that he was severely tortured. He was allegedly subjected to severe
torture at the Criminal Investigation Directorate. According to reports he was
subjected to electrical shocks to his genitals, left foot and back in addition
to simulated drowning, severe beatings, threats to publish his wife’s
photographs (taken from a camera confiscated by the security forces when his
house was raided), verbal abuse using uncivilized words, hanging by his hands
from the ceiling, sexual harassment and threats of rape, standing for hours,
and sleep deprivation. He was taken to the Ministry of Interior hospital twice
for treatment due to the torture.
 
Mr. Fateel had been arrested last year on February 14,
2012 while he was participating in a peaceful march toward the Pearl Roundabout
area, the now restricted centre of the 2011 protests for rights and democracy.
He was previously detained between December 2007 and April 2009, a period
during which he was also reportedly tortured.
 
On May 22, 2013, Naji Fateel was sentenced to six
months imprisonment on charges of attending illegal gatherings. He was charged
in another case with the establishment of a group for the purpose of disabling
the Constitution under Article 6 of the controversial Terrorism Act.
 
Actions requested:
 
Please write to the authorities of Bahrain urging them

of Messrs. Mohammed Al-Maskati, Naji Fateel and Hussain Abdulnabi and all human
rights defenders in Bahrain;
 
ii.     Release Messrs. Naji Fateel and Hussain Abdulnabi immediately and

identify all those responsible, bring them before an independent tribunal, and
apply them the sanctions provided by the law;
 
iv.    Put an end to all acts of harassment - including at the judicial level -
against Messrs. Mohammed Al-Maskati, Naji Fateel and Hussain Abdulnabi as well
as all human rights defenders in Bahrain;
 
v.     Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights
Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9,
1998, in particular its Article 1, which provides that “everyone has the right,
individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the
protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the
national and international levels”, Article 11, which states that “everyone has
the right, individually and in association with others, to the lawful exercise
of his or her occupation or profession”, Article 12(1) that provides “everyone
has the right, individually and in association with others, to participate in
peaceful activities against violations of human rights and fundamental
freedoms”, as well as Article 12.2, which provides that “the State shall take
all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of
everyone, individually or in association with others, against any violence,
threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or
any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise
of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”;
