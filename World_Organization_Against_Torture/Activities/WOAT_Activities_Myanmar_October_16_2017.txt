The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a 
partnership of FIDH and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), has 
received new information and requests your urgent intervention in the 
following situation in Burma.
  New information:
		The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the sentencing 
of environmental rights defender Mr. Khaing Myo Htun, 
co-founder of the NGO Natural Resources for the People[1], board member of the Arakan Natural 
Resources and Environmental Network, member of the advocacy group Arakan Oil 
Watch, and Deputy Spokesperson for the Arakan Liberation Party (ALP), at the 
end of a repeatedly delayed trial in Sittwe, Rakhine State.
According to the information received,on October 12, 2017, the Sittwe 
Township Court found Mr. Khaing Myo Htun guilty of “disturbing public 
tranquillity” and “incitement” under Article 505(b) and 
505(c) of the Criminal Code, and sentenced him to 18 months in prison. Mr. 
Khaing Myo Htun reportedly does not intend to appeal the verdict.

		 

		The Observatory recalls that Mr. Khaing Myo Htun has been detained since 
July 25, 2016 in Sittwe prison. He will now have to serve three months and 
ten days in prison as a result of time already served.

		 

		The charges against Mr. Khaing Myo Htun stem from a statement issued by 
the ALP on April 24, 2016, in which the party alleged human rights abuses by 
the Burma army (Tatmadaw) in Rakhine State, including claims of forced 
labour. The statement led to an army officer filing a complaint against Mr. 
Khaing Myo Htun under Article 505(b) and 505(c) of the Criminal Code.

		 

		The Observatory believes that Mr. Khaing Myo Htun’s sentencing and 
prolonged arbitrary detention are mere acts of retaliation for his 
legitimate and peaceful human rights activities, and recalls that Burmese 
authorities frequently use Article 505(b) and 505(c) of the Criminal Code to 
silence human rights defenders and other critical voices in Burma.

		 

		The Observatory is further concerned that the prolonged arbitrary 
detention of Mr. Khaing Myo Htun has led to a severe degradation of his 
health. During his detention, Mr. Khaing Myo Htun fainted three times in 
prison.

		 

		The Observatory urges the Burmese authorities to immediately and 
unconditionally release Mr. Khaing Myo Htun and ensure his physical and 
psychological integrity while in detention.

		 

Background information:

		 

		On July 25, 2016, Mr. Khaing Myo Htun was arrested and detained in Sittwe 
prison, pending a court decision on whether to charge him with 
“disturbing public tranquillity” and “incitement 
“under Article 505(b) and 505(c) of the Criminal Code.

		 

		On August 25, 2016 and January 13, 2017, the Sittwe Township Courtdenied 
bail to Mr. Khaing Myo Htun, despite his poor health condition.

		 

		On April 5, 2017, Mr. Khaing Myo Htun was charged with disturbing public 
tranquillity and incitement under Article 505(b) and 505(c) of the Criminal 
Code.

of Mr. KhaingMyo Htun and of all human rights defenders in Burma;

level - against Mr. Khaing Myo Htun and all human rights defenders in Burma,
