They were on the point of boarding a plane for Geneva, where they were expected. They had obtained their visas for Switzerland the day before.  The persons concerned are Mr. Noumri Brahim, ex-Sahraoui missing person from 1987 to 1991, freed from the secret detention centre of Kalaat M’Gouna, bearer of passport No. M 542832, and Mr. Elhamed Mahmoud, bearer of passport No. M 755551.  During this intervention, the police confiscated the passports of Messrs. Noumri and Elhamed.  Furthermore, their personal belonging and documents on video, computer disks and paper, which they were to produce before the Commission on Human Rights were also seized. No reason was given to the persons in question, other than instructions received by the police not to permit them to leave the territory.  After their release a few hours later, Messrs. Noumri and Elhamed had to spend the night in the airport. Even though their passports were returned to them the next day, instructions were issued by the Moroccan National Security services, forbidding Messrs. Noumri and Elhamed from leaving Moroccan territory.  The Observatory points out that these actions are in blatant contradiction with the Declaration on Defenders of Human Rights, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 9 December 1998, in particular, Article 9, paragraph 4 which enshrines the right of each person « individually or in association with others, without hindrance, to apply to competent international bodies in general or in particular, to receive and examine communications concerning Human Rights and to correspond freely with these bodies ».  Action requested :  Kindly write to the Moroccan authorities requesting them to :  i.	Immediately take all necessary measures so that the documents confiscated be returned forthwith to Messrs. Noumri and Elhamed and all obstacles hindering their freedom of movement be removed, so that they can come to Geneva as soon as possible.  ii.	Comply with the Declaration on Defenders of Human Rights, in particular, Article 1 which states that « each person has the right, individually or in association with others, to promote the protection and realisation of human rights et fundamental liberties at national and international levels » as well as Article 9, paragraph 4 mentioned above.  iii.	Comply, more generally, with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and regional and international instruments binding on Morocco.  Addresses :  H.H. King Mohammed VI.
