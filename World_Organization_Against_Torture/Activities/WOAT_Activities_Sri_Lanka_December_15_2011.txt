Enforced disappearance
Sri Lanka
December 15, 2011
 
The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint 
programme of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and the International 
Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), requests your urgent intervention in the 
following situation in Sri Lanka.
 
Description of the situation:
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the 
enforced disappearance of Messrs. Lalith Kumar Weeraraja and Kugan Muruganandan, two human rights activists in Jaffna. 
Both have been missing since December 9, 2011, as they were preparing a press 
conference to be held on Human Rights Day (December 10), where they intended to 
announce a protest that was planned to take place on December 13, 2011 in 
Colombo. The protest included parents and relatives of people missing since 
the end of armed conflict in Sri Lanka in 2009, and was to focus on denouncing 
human rights violations against Tamil civilians by the Sri Lankan military and 
calling for the release of detainees held without charges since the end of the 
war[1].
 
According to the information received, Messrs. Lalith Kumar Weeraraja and Kugan Muruganandan were last seen on 
December 9, 2011 as they were leaving Mr. Muruganandan’s residence in Avarangal, Jaffna, on a motorbike at 5.00 pm. 
 
The families were subsequently informed in an unofficial manner that the 
two defenders would be currently detained in an unidentified detention centre in 
the district of Jaffna.
 
On December 10, 2011, Mr. Muruganandan’s family lodged a complaint with the Achchiweli police station, but they were 
not handed any complaint number by the police station officers. On December 11, 
Mr. Weeraraja’s father lodged a complaint with the Kosgama police station, under No CIB 
94/133.
 
Mr. Lalith Kumar Weeraju, an Executive Committee member of the 
organisation “We Are Sri Lankans” and the Jaffna Coordinator of the Jana Aragalaya (People’s Struggle) movement[2], has been 
working for the release of persons from the north who are in detention. He has 
been involved in particular in the organisation of protest campaigns and press 
conferences for the promotion and protection of human rights, especially on the 
issue of enforced disappearances, as well as on issues faced by internally displaced persons in the north and the release of 
political prisoners. Mr. Muruganandan had assisted Mr. Weeraraja with his human 
rights campaigning activities, including on enforced 
disappearances.
 
In the past, Mr. Weeraraja was threatened several times by the army 
and police in relation to his protests against enforced disappearances and 
illegal detention. He was taken into military custody once in early 2011 in 
relation to these activities, and was threatened and interrogated. He was warned 
and threatened by the army and the police many times. The latter advised him not 
to engage in such human rights work as those were considered as political 
activities by them. 
 
The Observatory expresses its deep concern about Messrs. Lalith Kumar Weeraraja and Kugan Muruganandan’s enforced 
disappearance, and fears for their physical and psychological integrity. The 
Observatory calls upon the Sri Lankan authorities to take prompt action in order 
to disclose their fate and whereabouts and release them immediately as their 
arrest and enforced disappearance seem to merely aim at sanctioning their human 
rights activities. 
 
Actions requested:
 
Please write to the authorities of Sri Lanka urging them to: 

 
i.         
Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological 
integrity of Messrs. Lalith Kumar Weeraraja and Kugan Muruganandan, as well as of all human rights defenders in Sri 
Lanka;
 
ii.       
Take prompt action in order to disclose the fate and whereabouts of 
Messrs. Lalith Kumar Weeraraja and Kugan Muruganandan and release them immediately and unconditionally as their arrest 
seems to merely aim at sanctioning their human rights 
activities;
 
iii.      
Order an immediate, thorough, effective and impartial investigation 
into the above-mentioned facts, the result of which must be made public, in 
order to identify all those responsible, bring them before a civil competent and 
impartial tribunal and apply to them the penal sanctions provided by the 
law;
 
iv.     Put an end to all acts harassment against Messrs. Lalith Kumar Weeraraja and Kugan Muruganandan and, more generally, against all human rights defenders in Sri 
Lanka;
 
v.       
Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights 
Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 
1998, in particular :

individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the 
protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the 
national and international levels”, 
-    Article 12(1) that provides “everyone has the right, individually and 
in association with others, to participate in peaceful activities against 
violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms”, 
-    as well as Article 12.2, which provides that “the State shall take 
all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of 
everyone, individually or in association with others, against any violence, 
threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or 
any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of 
the rights referred to in the present Declaration”; 
 
vi.     Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental
