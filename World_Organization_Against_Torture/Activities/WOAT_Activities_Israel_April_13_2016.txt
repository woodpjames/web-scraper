The
PCATI has submitted in consultation with OMCT an alternative report to the UN Committee
Against Torture (CAT) for its review of the Fifth Periodic Report on Israel which
will take place on 3rd and 4th May 2016 in Geneva, in the framework of the 57th session of the CAT.
The
report focuses on five issues of concern :
-      
Lack of criminalization of torture in Israeli
Law and failure of Israel to prevent torture within its jurisdiction ;
-      
Lack of provision of real and effective
safeguards against torture ; 
-      
Need for a fully independent and impartial
mechanism to investigate allegations of torture ;
-      
Need for specific trainings on the prohibition
of torture and other ill-treatment, and incorporation of the use of the
Istanbul Protocol in the investigation and documentation of torture ;
-      
Lack of reparations for victims of torture in
Israel and in the Occupied Palestinian Territories.
Along
with specific recommendations formulated for each issue of concern, the report is
suggesting the CAT to adopt the following general recommendations with respect
to Israel :
1.    
Ratification of Optional Protocol to the
Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
Punishment, allowing National Preventive Mechanisms and the UN Subcommittee on
Prevention of Torture to visit all places of detention and detainees ;
2.    
Recognition of the competence of the CAT under
article 22 of the Convention to receive and examine communications from or on
behalf of victims of violations of the provisions of the Convention within the
jurisdiction of Israel.
