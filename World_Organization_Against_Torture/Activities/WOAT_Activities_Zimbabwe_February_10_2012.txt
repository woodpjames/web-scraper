The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint 
programme of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World 
Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), has received new information and requests 
your urgent intervention in the following situation in Zimbabwe.
 
New information:
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the 
provisional release and prosecution of ten members of Women and Men of Zimbabwe 
Arise (WOZA), a civic movement that defends women's rights and freedoms in 
Zimbabwe, including Ms. Jennifer Williams, National Coordinator.
 
According to the information received, on February 9, 2012, the ten 
WOZA members arrested on February 7, 2012 (See background information)[1] were presented to 
court and formally charged for “criminal nuisance” under Section 46 of the 
Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act [chapter 9:23][2]. They were 
initially detained for “failing to notify the police of a demonstration” under 
Section 25 of the Public Order Security Act (POSA).
 
All ten members were then released pending trial. The court set 
February 13, 2012 as provisional trial date. The four bystanders who had also 
been arrested on the same day were released at the court without charge. 

 
Moreover, four WOZA members who were arrested complained of being 
beaten upon arrest and handcuffed and dragged to central police station. All 
complained of mistreatment in detention as they were being kept by night in the 
cold in a open fenced area of the police and in the sun by day for long hours. 
In addition, several of those who were not arrested were beaten and had to be 
treated for bruising in their homes, as they found the riot police were waiting 
for them at the private clinic where any injuries are normally catered 
for.
 
The Observatory condemns the continuing judicial harassment of WOZA 
members since it seems to merely aim at sanctioning their human rights 
activities and expresses its deep concern about the ongoing attempts to hinder 
the peaceful activities of human rights defenders.
 
Background information:
 
In the afternoon of February 7, 2012, ten members of WOZA were 
arrested by the police while they were participating in a peaceful procession in 
Bulawayo that converged in front of the Joint Operations, Monitoring and 
Implementation Committee (JOMIC)[3] offices in 
Bulawayo while commemorating the 10th anniversary of WOZA. WOZA had also 
arranged a meeting with JOMIC in order to request them to act urgently according 
to their mandate to ensure the implementation of the Global Political Agreement 
(GPA) and ensure that abuse of rights by the police stop. 
 
As she was emerging from the meeting, Ms. Williams was arrested by 
riot police who were assaulting demonstrators as well as members of the public. 
All of this action took place in front of the members of the JOMIC delegation, 
who had asked during the meeting to be provided with concrete proof of the 
activities of the police. Nine other WOZA members and four bystanders were also 
arrested at different parts of the city.
 
Actions requested:
 
Please write to the authorities of Zimbabwe asking them 
to:
 
i.         
Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological 
integrity of Ms. Jennifer Williams, of the nine other WOZA members who were also 
arrested as well as all WOZA members and all human rights defenders in the 
country;
 
ii.       
Put an end to any kinds of harassment, including at the judicial 
level, against Ms. Jennifer Williams and the nine other WOZA members as well as 
against all human rights defenders in Zimbabwe; 
 
iii.      
Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights 
Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 
1998, especially its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, 
individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the 
protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the 
national and international levels”, and Article 12.2, which provides that the 
State shall “take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the 
competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, 
against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse 
discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his 
or her legitimate exercise of his or her rights”; 
 
iv.     More generally, ensure in all circumstances the respect for human 
rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with in accordance with the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with international and regional human 
rights instruments ratified by Zimbabwe.
