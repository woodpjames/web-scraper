Brief description of the situation: The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the risk of deportation of Mr. Per Bjorklund, an active Cairo-based freelance journalist covering the Egyptian strike wave[1], and reporting on labour issues and on human rights abuses in the country, as well as about the passport seizures and harassment against Messrs. Wael Abbas, human rights journalist and blogger, and Kamal Abbas, General Coordinator of the Centre for Trade Union and Workers' Services (CTUWS). According to the information received, on September 29, 2009, Mr. Per Bjorklund was detained upon arrival from Sweden - via Prague - at the Cairo International Airport, after he was told by the immigration services that his name was ”on the computer” with an order not to allow him into Egypt, a country where he has been living and working for three years. Mr. Bjorklund would have since then been held at the Cairo International Airport, reportedly awaiting for the next flight to Prague scheduled for October 1. The Observatory denounces the intention of the Egyptian authorities to deport Mr. Per Bjorklund, and fears that it might be a means to directly sanction his human rights activities. The Observatory further denounces the obstacles to the freedom of movement of Mr. Wael Abbas on the same day at the Cairo airport: according to the information received, his passport was seized and the latter was prevented to board a flight to London until the very last minute. The Observatory recalls that on June 30, 2009, Mr. Wael Abbas had been held at the Cairo airport for ten hours without due justification by the customs authorities, as he was returning from the Tällberg Forum 2009 in Sweden[2]. The Observatory further underlines that in early September, Mr. Kamal Abbas was held for over two hours at the Cairo airport and subject to provocations and passport seizure. He was then told by security agents that enquiries were being done to complete a report on his activities, for a submission to security bodies. He was eventually released and was able to catch his flight to Pittsburg, USA, where he was to attend the 26th Constitutional Convention of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO). Actions requested: Please write to the Egyptian authorities asking them to:   Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Messrs. Per Bjorklund, Wael Abbas and Kamal Abbas as well as all human rights defenders in Egypt;  Guarantee in all circumstances the freedom of movement of Messrs.
