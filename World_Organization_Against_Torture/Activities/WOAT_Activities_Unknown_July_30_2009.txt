New information: The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources of the release on bail from Evin prison of Ms. Shadi Sadr, a prominent lawyer, women's rights activist, Director of Raahi (a legal advice centre for women), founder of Zanan-e Iran (a website dedicated to the work of Iranian women's rights activists), and a journalist for Meydaan, an online newspaper on women's issues. According to the information received, on July 28, 2009, Ms. Shadi Sadr was released on payment of a 50,000 $ bail. However, Ms. Sadr remains accused of having acted against national security by provoking people to act in a disorderly fashion and to disobey police orders. On July 19, 2008 a first attempt to release her had failed when security guards called Ms. Sadr’s family asking them to provide bail. After having spent five hours waiting outside the Evin prison, Ms. Sadr's relatives had left. The Observatory welcomes Ms. Shadi Sadr’s release and wishes to thank all the persons, organisations, and institutions that intervened on her behalf. However, the Observatory remains concerned about the persistence of charges against her, which might be related to her constant involvement in defending women's rights in Iran. More generally, the Observatory expresses its deep concern about the current general crackdown on the Iranian civil society and the systematic repression faced by women's rights activists since 2006. Background information: In the morning of July 17, 2009, Ms. Shadi Sadr was approached in a crowded street by men in plainclothes as she was walking with several other women's rights activists. They assaulted her without showing any arrest warrant, forced her into a car and beat her as she was struggling to escape. Mr. Hossein Nilchian, her husband, reported that she had called him in the afternoon and told him that she was in Section 209 of the Evin prison. Ms. Shadi Sadr had also already been arrested and detained for two weeks in 2007[1] and had had numerous clashes with authorities over her outspoken stance on women's rights and on capital punishment. Actions requested: Please write to the Iranian authorities and ask them to:   Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Ms. Shadi Sadr;  Put an end to acts of harassment, including at the judicial level, against Ms. Shadi Sadr and all human rights defenders in Iran;  Conform in any circumstances with the provisions of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted on December 9, 1998 by the United Nations General Assembly, in particular its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually or in association with others, to promote the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, and its Article 12.2 which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”;  Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by Iran.
