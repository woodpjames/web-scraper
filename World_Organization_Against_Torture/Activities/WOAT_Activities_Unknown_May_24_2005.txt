New information:  The Observatory has been informed by the Iranian League for the Defense of Human Rights (Ligue pour la défense des droits de l’Homme en Iran - LDDHI) that Mr. Akbar Ganji, a prominent journalist and human rights defender who has been imprisoned for more than five years in Tehran’s Evin prison, begun an unlimited hunger strike at 7 pm on May 19, 2005 in order to protest against his imprisonment. As of the date of the release of this appeal, his hunger strike continues.  According to the information received, Mr. Akbar Ganji suffers from asthma and serious back problems for which he needs to be immediately hospitalised. However, in detention, Mr. Ganji does not have access to adequate treatment. His lawyers, including Mrs. Shirin Ebadi, 2003 Nobel Peace Prize and Secretary general of the Defenders of Human Rights Centre, have been asking for several months that he be hospitalised.   Moreover, it is important to note that under the Iranian Criminal Procedure Code, after a prisoner has served two thirds of his or her sentence, he or she can be released on parole. Since one year, while Mr. Ganji completed the non parole period of his sentence, his lawyers have been requesting that he be released on parole, in vain.   Background information:  Mr. Akbar Ganji, of the daily newspaper Sobh-e-Emrooz, was arrested on April 22, 2000 for having written several articles suggesting the involvement of the Iranian regime, including former President Hashemi Rafsanjani and former Intelligence Minister Ali Fallahian, in the assassination of dissident opponents and intellectuals in late 1998. Mr. Ganji was also arrested because he took part in a conference in Berlin on the Iranian legislative elections and democratic reforms in April 1998. In July 2001, he was sentenced to six years of imprisonment on the charge of “threatening national security and propaganda against the institutions of the Islamic State” (See Observatory Annual Report 2004).   Mr. Akbar Ganji is currently being held in solitary confinement in spite of the specific recommandation made on June 27, 2003, by the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention to the Islamic Republic of Iran to put an end to this widespread practice which it considered as arbitrary in nature (See the UN document E/CN4/2004/3/Add.2, paragraphs 4 and 5).   Action requested: Please write to the Iranian authorities, urging them to: i. allow Mr. Ganji to benefit from the adequate medical treatment requested by his state of health, outside the Evin prison;  ii. guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Akbar Ganji;  iii. release Mr. Akbar Ganji immediately;  iv. put an immediate end to all acts of harassment against Iranian human rights defenders;  v. conform with the provisions of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 9, 1998, in particular its article 1 which provides that “every person has the right, individually or collectively, to promote the protection and fulfilment of human rights and fundamental liberties at the national and international levels”, as well as its article 12.2, which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually or in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”;  vi. conform more generally with the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with the other international instruments ratified by the Islamic Republic of Iran.
