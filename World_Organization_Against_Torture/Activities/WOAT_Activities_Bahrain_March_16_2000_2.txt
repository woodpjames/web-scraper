Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT has received information from the Bahrain Human Rights Organisation, (BHRO), a member of the network, regarding the arrest and arbitrary detention of a number of persons, including 9 children (see appeal BHR 160300.CC) during February and March 2000.  Those arrested are:  Ali Al Qamish, 30, Murtada Al Qamish, 25, Rida Al Qamish, 19, Sadiq Al Qamish, 18, Mirza Ahmed Hassan Saleh, 20, Ali Ahmed Abdula, 18, Hussain Abdul Nabi Khadim, 18, Hussain Mirza Radi, 19, Ali Ahmed Al Aud, 30, Mohammed Jaffar Jasim, 22, Seyyed Nader Seyed Adnan Al  Falleh, 19, Mahir Abbas, 19, Fadil Abas Yahya Thamir, 18, Mohammed Baqir Hussain Rashid, 18, Ibraheem Fadel Habib Al Jabouri, 19, Badir Ahmed Al Jaziri, 32, Abdulla Habib Ahmed Habib, 23, Ebrahim Abdulla Zuhair, 23, Mohammed Hussain Jaffar, Mohammed Jaber Sha'lan, 19, Taqi Jaffar Al Halwachi, 40, Naer Burdistani, 36, Fadel Abbas, Mohammed Muhsin, 22 (released), Ali Al Me'abad, 22 (released).  Recalling previous appeals on Bahrain, involving frequent cases of detention, OMCT is concerned about the physical and psychological integrity of these persons.  These cases are part of the ongoing political unrest and the widespread popular movement calling for political reforms and the restoration of democracy.   On 26 August 1975, Amiri Act No. 14 was issued dissolving the National Assembly. Subsequently, Amiri Act No. 4 /1975 was issued suspending Article 65 of the Constitution and other articles relevant to the organization of parliamentary life. These two Acts, which are still in force, constitute a violation of Articles 65, 32/a, and 42 of the Constitution. The constitution establishes that in such an event elections for a new assembly must be held within two months. The ruling family has steadfastly refused to do it, and this refusal is one major factor underlying the current unrest.  These persons were arrested under the 1974 State Security Law which allows for the detention of a person without charge or trial for up to three years and sets a special court system "the State Security Court", a procedure of which falls short of International standards for fair trial.  Action requested  Please write to the authorities in Bahrain urging them to:  i.	take all necessary measures to guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of the above-mentioned persons; ii.	order their immediate release in the absence of valid legal charges or, if such charges exist, bring them before an impartial and competent tribunal and guarantee their procedural rights at  all times; iii.	put an immediate end to the use of arbitrary detention of  people by the police and abrogate 1974 State Security Law and all national laws which are not in compliance with international human rights standards; iv.	guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
