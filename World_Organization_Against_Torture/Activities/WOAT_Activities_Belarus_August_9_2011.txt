URGENT APPEAL – THE OBSERVATORY

BLR 007 / 0811 / OBS 104.1
Arbitrary detention / Judicial harassment
Belarus
August 9, 2011
 
The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint 
programme of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World 
Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), has received new information and requests 
your intervention in the following situation in Belarus.
 
New information:
 
The Observatory has been informed of the ongoing arbitrary detention 
of Mr. Ales Bialatski, President of the Human Rights Centre (HRC) 
"Viasna" and Vice-President of FIDH.
 
According to the information received, as of August 9, 2011, Mr. Ales 
Bialatski remained detained in the detention centre of the Interior Ministry, 
located in Valadarski street, and which is known for its harsh conditions of 
detention.
 
The Observatory recalls that Mr. Bialatski was arrested on August 4, 
2011 by the police representative of the Department of Financial Investigations. 

 
On the same day, a search was carried out in Mr. Bialatski’s house. 
Meanwhile, the police was waiting at the offices of the HRC "Viasna", where Mr. 
Bialatski was to be brought just after the search of his home, for a search of 
the office.
 
On August 5, 2011, Mr. Bialatski was transferred to a cell within the 
Financial Investigation Department of the State Control Committee, before being 
remanded in prison for ten days in the detention centre of the Interior 
Ministry.
 
This detention is related to a criminal case opened against Mr. 
Bialatski for supposed tax evasion under Article 243, part 2, of the Criminal 
Code of the Republic of Belarus (“concealment of profits on an especially large 
scale”), which provides for up to seven years' imprisonment with confiscation of 
property.
 
This case was opened on the basis of information related to Mr. 
Bialatski's bank account at a bank in Vilnius, Lithuania, which was provided by 
the Lithuanian Ministry of Justice to the Belarusian authorities. The Belarusian 
tax authorities interpreted the amount on the account of Mr. Bialatski's as his 
personal income and accused him of concealing it. In reality, this money, which 
was transferred by international organisations, was by no means used as personal 
funds but to finance the activities of the HRC "Viasna", such as assistance 
provided to victims of the political repression in the post-electoral 
context.
 
The Observatory calls for the immediate and unconditional release of 
Mr. Bialatski, as his arbitrary detention seems to merely aim at sanctioning his 
human rights activities.
 
The Observatory recalls in particular that the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders adopted by 
the UN General Assembly on December 9, 1998 provides that "everyone has the 
right, individually and in association with others":
- "to promote and to strive for the protection and realization of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels" 
(Article 1);
- "to form, join and participate in non-governmental organizations, 
associations or groups" and "to communicate with non-governmental or 
intergovernmental organizations" (Article 5(b) and (c));
- "to offer and provide professionally qualified legal assistance or 
other relevant advice and assistance in defending human rights and fundamental 
freedoms" (Article 9.3(c));
- "to solicit, receive and utilize resources for the express purpose 
of promoting and protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms through 
peaceful means" (Article 13).
 
Background information:
 
On August 4, 2011, at around 2 p.m., a group of people in plain 
clothes surrounded the office of the HRC "Viasna" in Minsk. Members of the HRC 
"Viasna" went out of the office and locked the door. They heard one of the 
plain-clothes individual report saying through his phone that "Bialtski [was] 
not [t]here".
 
Subsequently, at about 4.30 pm, Mr. Bialatski was arrested in the 
street in the city centre of Minsk by the police representative of the 
Department of Financial Investigations.
 
Actions requested:
 
The Observatory urges the authorities of Belarus to:
 
i. Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological 
integrity of Mr. Ales Bialatski as well as of all human rights defenders in 
Belarus;
 
ii. Release Mr. Ales Bialatski immediately and unconditionally since 
his detention is arbitrary as it seems to merely sanction his human rights 
activities;
 
iii. Put an end to all forms of harassment against him, and more 
generally against all human rights defenders in the 
country;
 
iv. Comply with all the provisions of the United Nations Declaration 
on Human Rights Defenders, in particular with articles mentioned 
above;
 
v. More generally, ensure in all circumstances the respect for human 
rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights and with international and regional human rights instruments 
ratified by Belarus.
