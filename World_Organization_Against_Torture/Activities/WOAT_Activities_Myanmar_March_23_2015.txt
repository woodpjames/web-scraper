The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights
Defenders, a joint programme of the International Federation for Human Rights
(FIDH) and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent
intervention in the following situation in Burma / Myanmar.
Description of the situation:
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the arbitrary detention
and sentencing of Messrs. Thein Aung
Myint and Saw Hla Aung, members of the Movement for Democracy
Current Force (MDCF). MDCF is a community-based organisation that campaigns
against land-grabbing and other human rights violations.
On March 23, 2015, a court in Mandalay’s Chan Aye Thar
Zan Township sentenced Movement for Democracy Current Force (MDCF) members
Messrs. Thein Aung Myint and Saw Hla Aung to six months in prison under Article
18 of the Act on the Right to Peaceful Assembly and Peaceful Procession for
leading a peaceful protest against electricity price hikes on March 27, 2014.
The court also sentenced two other people, Mr. Kyaw
Myo Htun and Ms. Khet Khet Tin, to six months under the same law in
connection with the March 27 protests, even though they were not involved in
the demonstration. Mr. Kyaw Myo Htun only observed and applauded the
protesters, while Ms. Khet Khet Tin, who is Thein Aung Myint's wife, was
shopping in the area at the time the protest took place. When she saw that
authorities were arresting her husband, she asked them not to use excessive
force in the process. The four are detained in Mandalay's Oh Bo Prison. Ms.
Khet Khet Thin will appeal the sentence.
Thein Aung Myint had applied for permission from
township authorities to hold the protest. However, authorities refused to grant
permission on the grounds that Thein Aung Myint was not a resident of that
township. About 100 people took part in the March 27 demonstration.
Thein Aung Myint is a human rights defender who has
been working to help communities advocate for their rights, including land
rights. He is also a former political prisoner. He was detained in 1994, 2007,
2009, 2010, and 2012 for his peaceful protest activities.
The Observatory regrets that MDCF members have been
the target of judicial harassment and arbitrary imprisonment.
The Observatory strongly denounces the detention and
judicial harassment of Messrs. Thein Aung Myint and Saw Hla Aung, which merely
aim at sanctioning their peaceful human rights activities, and calls for their
immediate and unconditional release.
Actions requested:
Please write to the authorities of Burma, urging them
to:
i.

in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Messrs. Thein
Aung Myint, Saw Hla Aung and Kyaw Myo Htun and Ms. Khet Khet Tin, as well as of all human rights defenders in
Burma;
ii.            
Release
Messrs. Thein Aung Myint, Saw Hla Aung and Kyaw Myo Htun and Ms. Khet Khet Tin

end to acts of any acts of harassment, including at judicial level, against
them as well as against all human rights defenders in Burma;

human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international
levels”;
-         
Article
6(a), which foresees that “everyone has the right, individually and in
association with others, to participate in peaceful activities against violations
of human rights and fundamental freedoms”;
-         
Article
12.2, which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to
ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually
and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de
facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other
arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the
rights referred to in the present Declaration”;
