Open Letter to ECOSOC regarding the Committee on NGOs

To: Member States of ECOSOC

Cc: Chair of the Committee on NGOs, President of the General Assembly, President of the Human Rights
Council, Member States of the UN General Assembly, UN Secretary General.

Excellencies,

We write to you regarding the ECOSOC Committee on NGOs (the Committee), which recommends
approval of consultative status for non-governmental organisations, enabling access to and participation
in a range of UN bodies and processes. ECOSOC Resolution 1996/31—which provides the mandate for
the work of the Committee— acknowledges ‘the breadth of non-governmental organisations’ expertise
and the capacity of non-governmental organisations to support the work of the United Nations.’

We are concerned about recent actions taken by the Committee suggesting it functions in a politicised
manner, particularly in regard to its consideration of applications for consultative status from human
rights organisations. We therefore call on UN Member States to ensure that the Committee upholds and
respects the rights to freedom of expression and association and accords due process to all applicants for
consultative status.

Several States have criticised the practice of the Committee in ECOSOC meetings. In 2015, Chile, Mexico
and Uruguay, as well as the European Union, expressed strong concerns about the recent politicisation of
the work of the Committee, in which some Committee members use procedural tactics to block certain
organisations from being granted consultative status.

In his 2014 report to the General Assembly (A/69/365), UN Special Rapporteur on the Rights to Freedom
of Peaceful Assembly and of Association, Mr. Maina Kiai criticised the multiple deferrals and perpetual
questioning of some applications by Committee members. He noted that ‘(m)ember States and the UN
have a legal obligation to strengthen civil society participation in the UN, including by ensuring that people
can exercise their rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association in multilateral arenas.’

At its most recent session in January 2016, the Committee voted to close an NGO’s application on the
basis that its work was contrary to the UN Charter, and then voted to deny the organisation the right to
engage in dialogue with the Committee and address the allegations. This was condemned in ECOSOC by
US Ambassador Mendelson who said that Committee members were using the body ‘to subvert the
purpose of the Committee by further restricting civic space at the UN and blocking or deferring NGO
applications on non-substantive grounds’.






The European Union noted that withdrawal of





consultative status might be used as a form of reprisal for the activities of NGOs. Chile, Mexico and





Uruguay called for greater transparency in the work of the Committee, recommending webcasting of





Committee sessions.








Recommendations:







As the parent body, ECOSOC must ensure that the practice and procedures of the Committee are
in keeping with the principles, spirit and purpose of ECOSOC resolution 1996/31, and in strict
compliance with international human rights standards.







The practice and procedures of the Committee should thus be uniformly applied, apolitical, fair,
transparent, non-discriminatory, consistent and expeditious. The practice and procedures should
not be used to block accreditation through repeated questioning and persistent deferrals.
ECOSOC must not allow its Committee's procedures and powers to be abused by imposing de
facto restrictions on freedom of opinion and expression or freedom of association in violation of
international human rights standards.







ECOSOC, and its NGO Committee, should demand that States fully respect the Declaration on
Human Rights Defenders, GA res 53/144 (1998), which affirms “the right, individually and in
association with others, to unhindered access and communication with international bodies.”
Instead, far too many of the Committee's actions appear themselves to pose an unacceptable
hindrance to such access, whether by design or in their impact.
ECOSOC should explicitly affirm the need for the NGO Committee to make sure that its own
processes fully respect international human rights standards, including by ensuring full respect
for the right of NGOs at risk of adverse decisions to be heard by the Committee, by excluding any
decision motivated by discrimination of any kind, and by committing itself to upholding the right
of everyone to unhindered access to international human rights bodies.
Specifically, ECOSOC should take into account the recommendations set forth by Chile, Mexico
and Uruguay and institute webcasting sessions of the Committee to encourage transparency in
its operations and enable NGOs whose applications are being considered by the Committee to
follow proceedings.
Furthermore, when putting themselves forward for membership of the Committee, Member
States must fulfill their responsibility to comply with international human rights standards,
including obligations to uphold the rights to freedom of association and expression.









Unfortunately, the practice of the Committee is reflective of growing restrictions on civil society globally

at the very time restrictions at the national level make access to the UN all the more crucial. The members
of ECOSOC should take into account the recommendations above in order to promote a safe, transparent
and enabling environment for civil society at the UN. By fostering such an environment, the UN can take
full advantage of the particular expertise and insights provided by NGOs while protecting the legitimacy
and credibility of its work.
