Description of the situation: The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources of the arbitrary arrests of Mr. Amir Mohamed Suliman, Chairperson of the Khartoum Centre for Human Rights and Environmental Development (KCHRED), Mr. Osman Hummaida, human rights researcher and member of OMCT Assembly of Delegates, and Mr. Abedlmonim Aljak, member of the Strategic Initiative for Women in Horn of Africa (SIHA). According to the information received, on November 24, 2008, at noon, a National Security Service police (NSS) officer as well as three policemen arrested Mr. Amir Mohamed Suliman at KCHRED’s offices and took him to the political department of the NSS offices in Khartoum North. He was released the same day at 8 pm without charge. On the same day, Messrs. Osman Hummaida and Abedlmonim Aljak were also arrested by the NSS at SIHA’s offices and brought to the political department of the NSS offices in Khartoum North. Mr. Abedlmonim Aljak spent the night in the NSS offices and was then released without charge on November 25, 2008 at 6 am. As of issuing this urgent appeal, Mr. Osman Hummaida remained detained at the political department of the NSS offices in Khartoum North and no charge had been brought against him. Furthermore, on November 25, 2008, in the beginning of the afternoon, the NSS asked Mr. Hummaida’s colleagues to bring to the NSS Mr. Hummaida’s clothes and medicine. Therefore, the Observatory fears that his detention will be prolonged. The three human rights defenders conduct advocacy in relation to the human rights situation in Sudan, including issues related to international justice, and in particular the investigation of the International Criminal Court (ICC) on international crimes committed in Darfur. During the interrogation, the NSS informed the human rights defenders that they were conducting an investigation on their involvement with the ICC investigation in Darfur. The Observatory expresses its deep concern over the continuing harassment of human rights defenders by the Sudanese authorities, especially those monitoring and denouncing the international crimes committed in Darfur and urges the Sudanese authorities to guarantee Mr. Hummaida’s physical and psychological integrity and security. Actions requested: Please write to the authorities of Sudan, urging them to:   Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Messrs. Amir Mohamed Suliman, Osman Hummaida and Abedlmonim Aljak;  Immediately release Mr. Osman Hummeida, since his detention is arbitrary as it seems to merely aim at sanctioning his human rights activities;  Put an end to any act of harassment, including at the judicial level, against all three targeted defenders as well as against all Sudanese human rights defenders;  Comply with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, and Article 12.2, which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”;  More generally, ensure in all circumstances the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with international and regional human rights instruments ratified by Sudan.
