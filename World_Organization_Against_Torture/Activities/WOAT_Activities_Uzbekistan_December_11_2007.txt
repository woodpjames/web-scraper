New information: The Observatory has received information from the Human Rights Society in Uzbekistan (HRSU) about new acts of violence against Mr. Ikhtior Khamroev, the son of Mr. Bakhtior Khamroev, head of the Djizak section of HRSU, and a second-year student at the Technological University of Djizak, who has been detained since the beginning of August 2006 (See background information). According to the information received, on November 29, 2007, Mr. Ikhtior Khamroev was severely beaten in the penitentiary colony UYA 64-18, where he is currently detained, to force him to admit that he had committed disciplinary offences. His family were hoping that he might be released early under a December 2007 presidential amnesty[1], but when his mother visited him on November 29 he told her that his sentence had been extended by seven months for alleged “disciplinary offences”. He feared the authorities would use this as a pretext to disqualify him from the amnesty. On November 30, 2007, Mr. Bakhtior Khamroev received a phone call from the colony UYA 64-18, and was informed that his son had been wounded in the abdominal area. However, sources inside the prison reported that he stabbed himself in the abdomen in protest. It is not clear how he managed to get a knife. He was apparently refused appropriate medical treatment, and locked in a punishment cell. The prison director has refused to allow his parents to visit him, and has given them no details of where he is held or about his medical condition. The Observatory fears that these events might be reprisals for the public criticisms of the authorities spoken out by Mr. Bakhtior Khamroev during Frontline’s annual conference on human rights defenders in Dublin, from November 22 to 24, 2007. Mr. Bakhtior Khamroev made his speech just days after the UN Committee Against Torture concluded that torture and impunity remained routine in Uzbekistan and criticised the authorities for their harsh treatment of human rights defenders. The Observatory is deeply concerned about these new acts of reprisals against Mr. Ikhtior Khamroev and fears for his physical and psychological integrity. The Observatory also considers his detention, which appears to be aimed at sanctioning his father’s human rights activities, as arbitrary. Background information: On August 2, 2006 the police of Djizak arrested Mr. Ikhtior Khamroev and opened an inquiry against him. Interrogated during more than eight hours without having access to a lawyer, he was then charged with “hooliganism” under article 277 of the Uzbek Criminal Code (Chapter XX: Crimes against public order). On September 24, 2006, Mr. Ikhtior Khamroev was sentenced to a three-year’ prison term by the court of Djizak, which was more than requested by prosecutor. This sentence was confirmed in appeal on September 29, 2006, by the regional court of Djizak, and on third instance, on November 22, 2006. On December 10, 2006, Mr. Ikhtior Khamroev was transferred from colony n°64/43, in Tchumurgan, to colony n°64/78, in the district of Zafarabad, also in Djizak region. Since the beginning of his detention, Mr. Ikhtior Khamroev has received two disciplinary warnings, which prevented him from being released under the terms of the amnesty that was voted by the Uzbek Parliament on November 30, 2006. His father, Mr. Bakhtior Khamroev, has also been subjected to many acts of harassment and intimidation. In particular, on August 18, 2006, he was attacked at his home, by a group of women, as he was having a meeting with two diplomats from the British Embassy. Seriously wounded, he had to be conducted to the hospital. On December 26, 2006, Mr. Ikhtior Khamroev asked the warden of the penal colony 64/78, where he was recently transferred, the permission to talk to a doctor. He was indeed feeling bad, as he was working hard at the colony, in the framework of his sentence. He also asked him to inform the chief of the colony about his health problems. The attendant allowed him to rest and promised to talk to the chief of the colony. However, on the next day, Mr. Ikhtior Khamroev was violently beaten at his workplace by employees of the colony. He was kept in handcuffs, kicked by feet, including on his stomach, seized by the hair and dragged on the ground. Then, he was placed in incommunicado detention for one day. As his health got worse, the chief of the colony ordered his transfer to Zafarabad regional hospital. However, he did not undergo any medical examination and was brought back to the colony soon after. On January 5, 2007, as his health got even worse, Mr. Ikhtior Khamroev was brought to Djizak regional hospital, where he received emergency care and was diagnosed with stomach ulcer. However, on the next day, the doctor changed his diagnosis after talking to the chief of the colony, and stated that Mr. Ikhtior Khamroev was “only” suffering from gastritis. On the same day, he was brought back to the colony.
