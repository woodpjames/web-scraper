URGENT APPEAL - THE OBSERVATORY

SYR 004 / 0311 / OBS 043
Arbitrary arrest / Incommunicado detention / 
Fear for psychological and physical integrity
Syrian Arab Republic
March 24, 2011
The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of
the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation
Against Torture (OMCT), has received new information and requests your urgent
intervention on the following situation in Syria.
Description of the situation:
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources
of the arbitrary arrest of Mr. Mazen Darwish, Director of the Syrian
Centre for Media and Freedom of Expression (SCM).
According to the information received, Mr. Mazen
Darwish went at noon on March 23, 2011 at the political police headquarters in
Almaysat in Damascus after being summoned by a high officer, who called him in
the morning. Since then, no further information could be obtained on Mr. Mazen
Darwish’s fate and whereabouts. 
The Observatory recalls that on March 16, 2011, Mr.
Mazen Darwish was among the activists arrested at the occasion of a peaceful
rally before the Ministry of the Interior organised to call for the release of
all prisoners of conscience in Syria.[1]
The
Observatory is deeply concerned by the arrest of Mr.
Mazen Darwish and fears for his physical and psychological integrity. The Observatory
calls upon the Syrian authorities to take prompt action in order to disclose
the fate and whereabouts of Mr. Mazen Darwish
and release him immediately as his arrest seems to merely aim at sanctioning
his human rights activities. 
Actions requested:
Please write to the Syrian authorities, urging them
to:
i. Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and
psychological integrity of Mr.
Mazen Darwish;
ii. Take
prompt action in order to disclose the fate and whereabouts of Mr. Mazen
Darwish and release him, as his arrest seems to merely aim at sanctioning his
human rights activities;
iii. Order
an immediate, thorough, effective and impartial investigation into the
above-mentioned facts, the result of which must be made public, in order to
identify all those responsible, bring them before a civil competent and
impartial tribunal and apply to them the penal sanctions provided by the law;
iv. Put
an end to any kind of harassment against all human rights defenders in Syria;
v. Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on
Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations
on December 9, 1998, especially:
- its Article 1, which states that
“everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to
promote and to strive for the protection and realization of human rights and
fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”;
- its Article 5 (a), which states that
“for the purpose of promoting and protecting human rights and fundamental
freedoms, everyone has the right, individually and in association with others,
at the national and international levels to meet or assemble peacefully”;
- and its Article 12.2, which provides
that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by
the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with
others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse
discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his
or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present
Declaration”;
vi. Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights
and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights
standards and international instruments ratified by the Syrian Arab Republic.
