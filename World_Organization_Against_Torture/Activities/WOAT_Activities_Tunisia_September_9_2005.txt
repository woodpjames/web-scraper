After prohibiting the founding congress of the Tunisian Journalists’ Union (SJT) on September 7, authorities prevented the Tunisian League for Human Rights (LTDH) from holding its 6th Congress, scheduled to begin today.   This drastic decision, targeting the oldest human rights’ organisation in the Arab World and Africa, aims to stifle the most important organisation for the defence of human rights in Tunisia.   While processed through formal legal channels, this decision illustrates the manipulation of the law by authorities.   Another victim, the Association of Tunisian Judges (AMT) itself, was locked out of their offices for taking a public position in favour of the independence of the judiciary.   This dark week for Tunisian human rights is part of an ongoing attack on fundamental freedoms which has included police surrounding the offices of human rights defenders, physical and verbal aggression, libellous campaigns and harassment.   These provocative policies do not augur well for a successful Summit.   It is unconscionable to hold a summit in such dire circumstances, with the LTDH, pillar of independent civil society, under attack.     We call upon the Tunisian government to respect its commitments on human rights, particularly freedom of expression and association guaranteed by international treaties ratified by the Tunisian Government and re-affirmed in December 2003 during the first phase of the WSIS.  We call upon the governments which will meet in Tunis in November 2005 to fully recognize the severity of the situation and to bring pressure to bear on the Tunisian authorities to respect their international obligations.
