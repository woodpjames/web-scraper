Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Informal Sector Service Center (INSEC), a member of the OMCT network, of death threats proffered against 30-year old Sarita Chapagain Sharma by security officials on March 12th, 2002 in Kohalpur Bazaar, Banke district, Nepal.  According to the information received, a group of 15 to 20 security officers arrived at Sarita Chapagain’s house at around 3 a.m. on March 12th, 2002.  When Sarita Chapagain opened the door, the security personnel reportedly pulled her by the hair and kicked her. They also pushed and dragged her 11-year old son out of the room.  Two of the security officers then reportedly pointed their guns at her chest and demanded that she hand over money that they claimed belonged to Maoist rebels, which she denied having in her possesion.  Intimidated by the death threats being proferred by the security officers, she gave them 25,000 rupees that she had reportedly collected from selling rice (Rs. 21,000), milk and ghee (Rs. 4,000).  Sarita Chapagain’s husband, Sesha Kanta Sharma, who has been charged with being a Maoist, has reportedly been in detention since November 29 th, 2001.        The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned with the Nepalese’s authorities use of death threats against Sarita Chapagain Sharma and the looting of her money.  OMCT fears that the alleged perpetrators of these acts will not be brought to justice and that Sarita Chapagain Sharma will not be awarded adequate compensation and full restoration of the plundered money.
