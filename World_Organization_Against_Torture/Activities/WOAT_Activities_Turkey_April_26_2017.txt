The Observatory for the
Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a partnership of FIDH and the World
Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), has received new information and requests
your urgent intervention in the following situation in Turkey.
 
New information:
 
The Observatory has been
informed by reliable sources about the conviction and sentence against Dr.
Serdar Küni, Cizre Representative of the Human Rights Foundation of Turkey
(TİHV) and former President of the Şırnak Chamber of Medicine. 
According to the
information received, on April 24, 2017, Dr. Serdar Küni was sentenced to four
years and two months of imprisonment by the Şırnak Second Heavy
Penal Court under Article 220/7 which states that “a person who knowingly and
willingly assists the organization but is not within the hierarchical structure
of the organization is punished as a member of the organization ”. His sentence
is related to his work as a physician, providing health service in Cizre which
experienced intensified armed operations[1].
Dr. Serdar Küni who had
been detained since his arrest on October 19, 2016 (see background
information), was released pending final an appeal decision of the Gaziantep
regional high court. As of publishing this appeal, no date for the decision had
been set.
The Observatory strongly
condemns the sentencing of Dr. Serdar Küni as it only aims at sanctioning his
legitimate human rights activities.
Accordingly, the
Observatory urges Turkish authorities to put an end to all forms of harassment,
including at the judicial level, against Dr. Serdar Küni.
Background
information:
On October 19, 2016, Dr.
Serdar Küni was heard by the Cizre Prosecutor, after an arrest warrant was
issued against him. He was arrested on the spot and further detained at the
prison of Şırnak.
His trial opened before
the Şırnak Second Heavy Penal Court on March 13, 2017. During the
first hearing, no concrete evidence was provided against Dr. Serdar Küni and
witnesses who provided testimonies stated that these had been obtained under
torture. The hearing was postponed to April 24, 2017.
Actions requested:
 
Please write to the
authorities in Turkey, urging them to:
 
i. Put an end to all forms
of harassment, including at judicial level, against Dr. Serdar Küni, as well as all human rights defenders in Turkey;
 
ii. Guarantee in
all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Dr. Serdar Küni
as well as of all human rights defenders in Turkey;
 
 
iii. Comply with all the
provisions of the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, in
particular with its Articles 1, 6(a), 9, 11, 12.2;
 
iv. Ensure in all
circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance
with international human rights standards and international instruments

[1]           Cizre has witnessed unprecedented destruction following
clashes which took place during a curfew lasting over 78 days, at the beginning
of 2016. In a statement, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra’ad Al
Hussein urged in particular “the Turkish authorities to respect the fundamental
rights of civilians in its security operations and to promptly investigate the
alleged shooting of a group of unarmed people”. See: Turkey: Zeid concerned
