The Observatory for the Protection of
Human Rights Defenders, a partnership of the World Organisation Against Torture
(OMCT) and FIDH, has received new information and requests your URGENT
intervention in the following situation in Malaysia.
 
New
information:
 
The Observatory has been informed about
the release and subsequent deportation of Mr. Adilur
Rahman Khan, Secretary of the human rights non-governmental
organisation Odhikar in
Bangladesh[1],
also a member of OMCT General Assembly and FIDH Vice-President.
 
According to the information received, on July 20, 2017, at around
8 pm, Mr. Adilur Rahman Khan was deported back to Bangladesh after
being detained for more than 14 hours by Malaysian Immigration at Kuala Lumpur
International Airport.
 
The Observatory recalls
that on July 20, 2017, at about 4.00 am, Mr. Adilur Rahman Khan was denied
entry into Malaysia and detained by immigration officers upon his arrival in
Kuala Lumpur, where he had come to attend the National Conference on Death
Penalty organised by the Anti-Death Penalty Asia Network (ADPAN) from July 21
to 22, 2017. 
 
At no time during his
detention, he was given access to a lawyer nor a clear reason for his
detention. It is only around the end of this detention that he could meet with
representatives of the National Human Rights Commission of Malaysia (SUHAKAM).
 
The Observatory strongly
condemns Mr. Adilur Rahman Khan’s arbitrary arrest and subsequent deportation,
and calls upon the Malaysian authorities to guarantee in all circumstances the
freedoms of movement, peaceful assembly and association of
all human rights defenders in Malaysia.
 
Moreover, the
Observatory recalls that Mr. Adilur Rahman Khan has been the
subject of relentless acts of harassment over the past years[2], raising fears that he may face
additional harassment upon his arrival in Dhaka. Accordingly the Observatory urges the Government of Bangladesh to make sure that he will
not be subjected to further acts of harassment upon his return to Bangladesh.
 
Actions requested:
 
Please
write to the authorities in Malaysia, urging them to:
 
i.
Guarantee
in all circumstances the freedoms of movement, peaceful assembly and
association of Mr. Adilur Rahman Khan, as well as of all
human rights defenders in Malaysia;
 
 
ii.

all human rights defenders in Malaysia, and ensure that they are able to carry out their

adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998,

in accordance with international human rights standards and international
instruments ratified by Malaysia.
