The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in Sudan.
Description of the situation:
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the arbitrary arrest, continued detention and torture of human rights defenders. 
According to the information received, on February 2, 2011, Mr. Abdelazim Mohamed Ahmed, Director of the Kharthoum branch of the Easter Centre for Culture and Legal Aid was arrested by the National Intelligence and Security Services (NISS) with two other friends while he was driving. Mr. Abdelazim Mohamed Ahmed remains in incommunicado detention in an unknown location. 
On February 3, Mr. Ahmed Mahmoud Ahmed, student activist, blogger and rapper was also arrested by the NISS in Karthoum Bahri. Mr. Mahmoud Ahmed also remains in detention. He is currently being taken away during the evenings while the rest of the detainees sleep. According to the information received, electric shocks have been administered on him three times daily for a week, and he has been forced to wear only his underwear. His lawyer has not been informed of any charge against him. 
These arrests occurred in the context of peaceful social protest movements in favour of democracy and the respect of human rights led by youth activists which began on January 30, 2011. These demonstrations have been violently repressed by the national security forces. More than one hundred demonstrators would have been arrested in the last ten days and some of them remain in detention where they are reportedly subjected to acts of torture and ill-treatments by the NISS. Human rights defenders have been particularly targeted by the authorities in this context. 
The Observatory expresses its deepest concern about these cases and the prevalence of torture and incommunicado detention which seem to merely aim at sanctioning their human rights activities and the legitimate exercise of their right to freedom of expression as protected by Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The Observatory therefore calls on the authorities to guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Messrs. Abelazim Mohamed Ahmed and Ahmed Mohamed Ahmed, and release them immediately and unconditionally as their detention is arbitrary.
Actions requested:
The Observatory urges the authorities of Yemen to: 
i.      Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Messrs. Abelazim Mohamed Ahmed and Ahmed Mohamed Ahmed, as well as of all human rights defenders in Sudan;
ii.     Put an end to any kind of harassment, including at the judicial level, against Messrs. Abelazim Mohamed Ahmed and Ahmed Mohamed Ahmed, as well as of all human rights defenders in Sudan, and ensure in all circumstances that they are able to carry out their work without hindrances;
iii.    Release Messrs. Abelazim Mohamed Ahmed and Ahmed Mohamed Ahmed immediately and unconditionally as their detention is arbitrary since it only aims at sanctioning their human rights activities;
iv.    Conform in any circumstances with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, in particular its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually or in association with others, to promote the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, and its article 12.2 which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”; 
v.     Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by Sudan.
