URGENT APPEAL - THE OBSERVATORY

 
LBN 001 / 0518 / OBS 063
Arbitrary detention 
Lebanon
May 16, 2018
 
The Observatory for the Protection of
Human Rights Defenders, a partnership of FIDH and the World Organisation
Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent intervention in the following
situation in Lebanon. 
 
Brief description
of the information:
 
The Observatory has been informed by
reliable sources about the arbitrary arrest and detention of Mr. Ghassan
Abdullah, General Director of the Palestinian Human
Rights Organization (PHRO).
 
According
to the information received, on the morning of May 14, 2018, Mr. Ghassan
Abdullah presented himself to the Lebanese General Security after being
summoned for “security investigation”. Since then, he has only been allowed to contact his mother once in
order to ask her to get him his medicine, which he has received through the NGO
Caritas.
 
It has been reported that Mr. Ghassan Abdullah would have since been
transferred to the Ministry of Defense’s premises in Yarzeh, southeast of
Beirut. 
 
The Observatory strongly condemns the arbitrary detention of Mr.
Abdullah, which only aims at silencing his peaceful and legitimate human rights
activities.
 
Moreover, the Observatory expresses particular concerns as the health of
Mr. Abdullah is very fragile and he cannot tolerate any pressure or detention.
As a consequence, his continued detention and any hindrance into  his daily medicines for chronic diseases would
pose a serious threat to his life.
 
The Observatory urges the Lebanese authorities to immediately and
unconditionally release Mr. Ghassan Abdullah. In the meanwhile, the Observatory
urges the Lebanese authorities to take any step to ensure Mr. Ghassan
Abdullah’s physical and psychological integrity.
 
Actions requested: 
 
Please write to the authorities in
Lebanon, urging them to:
 
i.
Ensure Mr. Ghassan
Abdullah’s physical and psychological integrity;
 
ii.   
Immediately and
unconditionally release Mr. Ghassan Abdullah as his detention is arbitrary and
only aims at silencing his peaceful and legitimate human rights activities;
 
iii.  
Put an end to all forms of harassment against Mr. Ghassan Abdullah and all human rights defenders
in Lebanon;
 
iv. 
Comply with all the provisions of the UN Declaration
on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on
December 9, 1998, in particular with its Articles 1, 5(b), and 12.2;
 
v.   
Ensure in all circumstances the respect for human
rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights and with international human rights instruments ratified by
Lebanon.
