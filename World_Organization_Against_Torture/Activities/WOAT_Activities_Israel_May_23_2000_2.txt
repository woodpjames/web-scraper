New Information  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Palestinian Society for the Protection for Human Rights and the Environment (LAW), a member of the OMCT network, of the deaths of another two persons, including a child, from injuries sustained during clashes with Israeli occupation forces.  According to the information received, on 20th May 2000, Issa Abed, 30, from the Qadoura Refugee Camp died in Ramallah hospital after he had sustained head injuries from a live bullet fired during clashes with the occupying forces at a check point north of Ramallah.    Issa Abed was the fifth victim since the start of demonstrations by Palestinians to commemorate the 1948 Nakba day and peaceful marches in solidarity with Palestinian prisoners who have been on a hunger strike for the last few weeks.  The International Secretariat of OMCT reiterates LAW’s concerns that despite the loss of life, the Israeli occupation forces continue to use unacceptable excessive force against unarmed Palestinian citizens.  Furthermore, that the Israeli occupation forces are using live ammunition and that most injuries sustained by Palestinians are in the chest, abdomen and neck areas.  OMCT strongly condemns the excessive use of force by Israeli forces at peaceful demonstrations held by Palestinians.  Brief reminder of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT was informed by LAW  of the killing of four persons and hundreds injured in various incidents and clashes between Palestinian demonstrators and Israeli occupying forces from 10th to 15th May.  According to LAW, on 13th May 2000, clashes between Palestinian demonstrators and Israeli occupying forces resulted in the death of Ahmad Shreim from Qalqilya.  Clashes also took place in the Meggido prison and an estimated 100 prisoners were injured when Israeli soldiers stormed the prison and released gas canisters and sound bombs.  It is also reported that on 15th May 2000, Adel Asafadi, 19, from Orif village in the district of Nablus, died after being shot in the neck by Israeli soldiers who were firing live ammunition to dispel a crowd of demonstrators at the Palestinian checkpoint south of Nablus. The victim died on the way to hospital.  Bashar Shantir, 18, from Askar Refugee Camp, was also shot in the vicinity of Joseph's tomb in Nablus.  Ahmad Odeh, 20, from Deir Al Hatab near Nablus, a member of the National Forces, was shot dead in the Al Bireh vicinity.   It is estimated that 862 Palestinians were injured in the period 10-14 May 2000.  Action requested  Please write to the authorities in Israel urging them to:  intervene with the appropriate authorities in order to secure that the adequate medical assistance is provided to all those injured in the clashes; put an end to the unacceptable use of excessive force by the Israeli armed forces against peaceful demonstrators and guarantee an immediate investigation into the death of Issa Abed, and the injuries of the above-mentioned incidents, identify those responsible, bring them before a civil competent and impartial tribunal and apply the penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions provided by law; guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
