One of these is in response to the initial periodic report of Kenya and has been prepared in collaboration with the Kenyan Section of the International Commission of Jurists and the Centre for Minority Rights Development. The other report is in response to the initial-fourth periodic report of the Philippines, and has been prepared together with the Philippines Alliance of Human Rights Advocates, Karapatan and Task Force Detainees of the Philippines.  These two reports share a common approach based on the conviction that torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment and other forms of violence are related in many ways to – and are often directly caused by - disrespect for economic, social and cultural rights. If, therefore, these phenomena are to be effectively eliminated, then their economic, social and cultural root causes must be, first, understood and, secondly, effectively addressed.
