Rep.: Loas: death in custody of Khamphouvieng Sisa-AtURGENT APPEAL –THE OBSERVATORY  LAO 001/0604/OBS 041 Death in custody 	Laos June 2, 2004   The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the World Organisation against Torture (OMCT) and the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in Laos.  New information:  On May 25, 2004, the Observatory was informed by the Lao Movement for Human Rights (LMHR) of the death of Khamphouvieng Sisa-At, one of the leaders of the “Lao Students Movement for Democracy of 26 October 1999,” a group that organized a peaceful march on  October 26, 1999, in Vientiane, to denounce social injustice and to call for the respect of human rights and democratic reforms in Laos.  According to the information received, Mr. Khamphouvieng Sisa-At died in late 2001 as a result of the mistreatment he endured while in detention in Samkhe prison, which is located in a suburb of Vientiane. He reportedly died after being exposed to heat for a long period of time. Although Laotian authorities had been concealing Mr Khamphouvieng Sisa-At’s death, information about it emerged this past May following the release of co-detainees who had witnessed his death.  The Observatory fears for the physical and psychological integrity of other members of the 26 October Movement whose whereabouts remain unknown, including MM. Thongpaseuth Keuakoun, Sengaloun Phengphanh, Bouavanh Chanhmanivong and Keochay.  Brief overview of the facts:  The Observatory recalls that Thongpaseuth Keuakoun, Khamphouvieng Sisa-At, Sengaloun Phengphanh, Bouavanh Chanhmanivong and Keochay, members of the “Lao Students Movement for Democracy of 26 October 1999,” were arrested in October 1999 by the secret police. They were among a group of people who publicly called for the respect of human rights, the release of political prisoners, a multi-party political system and elections for a new National Assembly. The Observatory addressed their case in an open letter to Laotian authorities dated August 20, 2003. However, the authorities never provided clear information regarding the situation of the five human rights defenders.  Actions requested:  Please write to the Lao authorities and urge them to:  i. provide information on the whereabouts of MM. Thongpaseuth Keuakoun, Sengaloun Phengphanh, Bouavanh Chanhmanivong and Keochay, and ensure in all circumstances their physical and psychological integrity; ii. release the above named detainees immediately and unconditionally; iii. return the body of Uthayakumar Khamphouvieng Sisa-AT to his relatives; iv. put an end to any kind of harassment against human rights defenders in Laos, in conformity with the UN Declaration on Humans Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, which stipulates in its article 1 that “everyone has the right, individually or in association with others, to promote the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels” ; vi. ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards.
