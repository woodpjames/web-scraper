Brief description of the situation: The Observatory has been informed by Human Rights in China (HRIC) that Mrs. Mao Hengfeng, a well-known petitioner against family planning policies and forced evictions in Shanghai, was subjected to physical and mental ill-treatments while detained for more than a month for her participation in a hunger strike in mid-February 2006.  According to the information received, Mrs. Mao Hengfeng took part in a nationwide hunger strike in support of lawyer Mr. Gao Zhisheng and other human rights defenders in February 2006, who started a hunger strike against official repression and violence in the country. Mr. Gao Zhisheng is the director of the Beijing-based Shengzhi Law Office, that has taken on high-profile human rights cases. In November 2005, the activities of the Shengzhi Law Office were suspended by the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Justice for one year. In December 2005, Mr. Gao Zhisheng’s licence to practice law was revoked. These events followed the publication of an open letter on religious freedom.   On the evening of February 13, 2006, Mrs. Mao was placed  under residential surveillance in an apartment in Yangpu District’s Gongqing Forest Park on the basis of an administrative decision issued that same day for suspicions of “causing a disturbance in a public place” until she was finally released on March 29, 2006.   According to Mrs. Mao, five or six people were watching her every day, and beat her on several occasions. In particular, one of them surnamed Bai, knelt on her chest and grabbed her around the neck, saying he would “cause the blood to flood [her] brain so that the cause of death could not be determined”.  During Mrs. Mao’s detention, her lawyer was reportedly denied access to her.  The Observatory expresses its deep concern over allegations of physical abuse and other violations committed against Mrs. Mao Hengfeng during her custody, and strongly condemns them.  Furthermore, the Observatory has learned that on February 15, 2006, Mrs. Ma Yalian was arrested by police officers in the same context, at the home of a friend in a village in Shanghai’s Minxin District. Shortly after the friend returned home from work, police arrived at his door with a search warrant and carried away all of Mrs. Ma’s personal belongings and papers. Mrs. Ma had been under constant surveillance since being released from 10 days of unlawful detention at the beginning of February 2006. Background information:Mrs. Mao Hengfeng had already been subjected to various acts of harassment and detentions in the past (See Observatory Annual Report 2005). For instance, in April 2004, she had been sentenced to 18 months of Re-education Through Labour (RTL) by the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, due to her activities in favour of human rights.. During her detention, Mrs. Mao had been subjected to violence and ill-treatment, being in particular beaten with her feet and hands tied.  From 23 to 27 September 2005, Mrs. Mao and her close family were placed under house arrest, after she announced her intention to protest against acts of harassment at the United Nations office in Beijing. Seven police officers were then placed on duty in front of her apartment, to prevent her from leaving.   On December 28, 2005, Mrs. Mao Hengfeng, along with twelve other petitioners, was arrested in Beijing while they intended to attend the lowering of the flag at Tiananmen Square. On the evening of December 29, 2005, Mrs. Mao and her two daughters were forcibly sent back to Shanghai. The following day, Mrs. Mao immediately returned to Beijing where she was arrested again on January 1, 2006 and sent back to Shanghai, where she and her two daughters were taken to the Yangpu district police station.  In August 2005, Mrs. Ma Yalian was released, after serving a year-and-a-half sentence of RTL. She had been arrested following the publication, on the Internet, of an article entitled A True Record of Being Turned Away from the National Petitions and Letters Office and the Petitions Bureau of the National People’s Congress, in which she denounced acts of ill-treatment inflicted on petitioners by the police and civil servants at the main entrance of the Petitions Office in Beijing. In this article, Mrs. Ma Yalian also reported on the acts of violence and humiliation to which she had been subjected at the Office.   On November 17, 2005, police prevented Mrs. Ma Yalian from leaving her home. After she explained that she had to file a complaint against the government that very day, otherwise it would be inadmissible, she was taken by force to a guesthouse in Qingpu, near Shanghai, and placed under house arrest.  On December 22 , 2005, Mrs. Ma Yalian was again arrested by the local police, before being released on 28 December 2005 (See Observatory 2005 Annual Report).
