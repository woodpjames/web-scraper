Brief description of the situation:The Observatory has been informed by the Sudan Organisation Against Torture (SOAT) of the arbitrary arrest and harassment of Mr. Mohamed Badawi, a human rights lawyer in el Fashir, Northern Darfur. Mr. Badawi is also the Coordinator of the Amel Centre for the Treatment and Rehabilitation of Victims of Torture, which provides legal aid to victims of torture and sexual violence, and individuals at risk of cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment such as the death penalty and amputations.  According to the information received, on September 9, 2006, Mr. Badawi was summoned by the National Security Bureau (NSB) in el Fashir. He immediately reported to the NSB offices, where he remained for more than three hours without being interrogated. He was then released without charge but ordered to report again to the offices on the following day.  On September 10, 2006, at around 9:15 am, Mr. Badawi duly reported to the NSB, where he was held until 3:00 pm. He was then interrogated by security officers about the Amel Centre’s activities, as well as its relationship with international organisations and the Communist Party, before being released without charge.  The Observatory expresses its deep concern about these events, along with the recurrent pattern of harassment of human rights defenders that has emerged in Darfur and throughout Sudan over the past few months. More specifically, the members of the Amel Centre have become a target of choice for harassment and intimidation (See for instance Observatory Urgent Appeals SDN 004/0506/OBS 062, 062.1 and 062.2). The Observatory considers that these repeated acts of harassment, summoning and interrogation are only intended to intimidate human right defenders and to prevent them from carrying out their work. Action requested:Please write to the authorities of Sudan urging them to:  i.	guarantee under all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Mohamed Badawi, as well as of all members of the Amel Centre for the Treatment and Rehabilitation of Victims of Torture;  ii.	put an end to all acts of harassment and intimidation against human rights defenders in Sudan;  iii.	conform with the provisions of the Declaration on Humans Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, in particular article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually or in association with others, to promote the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, article 5, which provides that “for the purpose of promoting and protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms, everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, at the national and international levels:(a) To meet or assemble peacefully; (b) To form, join and participate in non-governmental organizations, associations or groups; (c) To communicate with non-governmental or intergovernmental organizations (article 5)”, and article 12.2, which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually or in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”;  iv.	more generally, ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in Sudan in accordance with its national laws, the National Interim Constitution (2005) and international human rights standards.
