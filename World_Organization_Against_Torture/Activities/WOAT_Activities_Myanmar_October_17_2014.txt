The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights
Defenders, a joint programme of the International Federation for Human Rights
(FIDH) and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), has received new
information and requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in
Burma.
 
New Information:
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the release of Mr. Thaw Zin, a member of
the Yangon People's Support Network and an activist campaigning for farmers
affected by the Letpadaung copper mine in Salingyi Township, Sagaing Region[1].
 
According the information received, on September 26, Mr. Thaw Zin was
released from Monywa prison. No reason was given for his early release. 
 
The Observatory welcomes the release of Mr. Thaw Zin and thanks all the
individuals, institutions, and organisations who intervened in his favour.
However, the Observatory regrets that he was arbitrarily detained for more than
seven months before being released. 
 
The Observatory more generally reiterates its call on the Burmese
authorities to put an end to all acts of harassment – including at the judicial
level – against all human rights defenders in Burma, and to comply with all
international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by
Burma, in particular the United Nations (UN) Declaration on Human Rights
Defenders, adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 9, 1998.
 
Background information:
 
Peaceful protests that began in August 2012 against
the Letpadaung copper mine were heavily repressed by the authorities on several
occasions. In November 2012, police used white phosphorus bombs to disperse
peaceful protestors, injuring dozens, including Buddhist monks.
 
Mr. Thaw Zin had previously been detained in 2013 under Article 18 of the
Peaceful Assembly and Peaceful Procession Law, for organising protests without
obtaining the authorities’ prior permission[2]. The charge was subsequently dropped under a
presidential amnesty announced on December 31, 2013.
 
On February 11, 2014, at about
10 am, six plain-clothed police
officers arrested Mr. Thaw Zin in Salingyi
Township. Shortly after the arrest, about 100 villagers marched to the Nyaungpingyi
police station, calling for Mr. Thaw Zin’s release, but the authorities
declined to explain the reasons of the arrest. Later, the police only confirmed
that Mr. Thaw Zin had been sent to Monywa
prison. 
 
In March 2014, Mr. Thaw Zin was
sentenced to 15 months in prison under Article 447 (trespassing) and 505(b)
(disturbing public tranquillity) of the Criminal Code for his role in helping
local villagers protest against land seizures related to the Letpadaung copper
mine.
 
Actions requested:
 
Please write to the authorities of Burma, urging them to:
 
i.             
Guarantee in all
circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Thaw Zin, as well as of all human rights defenders in
Burma/Myanmar;

Put an end to acts of
any acts of harassment, including judicial harassment, against him as well as
against all human rights defenders in Burma/Myanmar;
 
iii.

others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realization of human
rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”;
-         
Article 6(a), which
foresees that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with
others, to participate in peaceful activities against violations of human
rights and fundamental freedoms”;
-         
Article 12.2, which
provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the
protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in
association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de
facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other
arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”;
