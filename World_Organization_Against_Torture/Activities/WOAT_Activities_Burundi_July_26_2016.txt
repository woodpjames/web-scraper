Geneva, 26 July 2016 – A coalition
of Burundian NGOs[1], with the support of
the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), the International Federation of Action by Christians
for the Abolition of Torture (FIACAT), TRIAL International, the Centre
for Civil and Political Rights (CCPR) and DefendDefenders (East and Horn of
Africa Human Rights Defenders Project) have submitted a report
condemning a resurgence in extrajudicial executions, enforced disappearances,
arbitrary arrests and cases of torture.
During the 58th session of the United
Nations Committee Against Torture (CAT) from 25 July to 12 August, experts of
the CAT will exceptionally examine Burundi following the deterioration of the
human rights situation in the country, triggered by a political crisis
affecting the country since 2015. 
Civil society has provided
experts with an alternative report describing the alarming situation in the
country since its last review by the CAT in 2014, and in particular the
worsening situation in light of the 2015 political crisis. The report documents
numerous violations of the Convention Against Torture, such as the increased
use of torture, poor treatment during arbitrary arrests and detention, and a
significant increase in extrajudicial executions and enforced disappearances.
The
signatories are also deeply concerned by the lack of investigations into these
violations and by the culture of impunity prevailing throughout the country. 
The
recommendations of the report call on the Burundian Government to put a stop to
these violations, to prosecute those responsible, and to guarantee compensation
for victims.
The report is available
in French and English. 
The
review of Burundi can be followed live at http://webtv.un.org/
(10:00 CET on 28 July; 15:00 CET on 29 July).
