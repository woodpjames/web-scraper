Tep Vanny, Nget Khun, Song Sreyleap, Kong Chantha, Pan Chunreth, Bop Chorvy and Nong Srengand, were arrested on November 10, 2014, while protesting in front of Phnom Penh City Hall where the group had placed a bed frame in the middle of Monivong Boulevard. The peaceful protest was designed to draw attention to the chronic and severe flooding of their neighbourhood during the rainy season. Residents blame the flooding on the filling-in of Boeung Kak Lake by Shukaku, a housing construction company owned by Cambodian People’s Party (CPP) Senator Lao Meng Khin. The protesters also asked that local authorities immediately fix inadequate drainage in the neighbourhood[1]. Mss. Heng Pich, Im Srey Touch and Phoung Sopheap were arrested as they were protesting against the detention of the seven women outside Phnom Penh Municipal Court. Arrested on two separated occasions, the ten human rights defenders were sentenced on November 11 and November 12, 2014, by the Phnom Penh Municipal Court, to a year in prison and a two-million Riel (about 470 Euro) fine respectively on charges of obstructing public traffic and aggravated obstruction of public officials[2]. Actions requested: Please write to the authorities of the Kingdom of Cambodia asking them to : i.
