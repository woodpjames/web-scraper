Provisional
release / Judicial harassment
Turkey

The Observatory for the Protection of Human
Rights Defenders, a partnership of FIDH and the World Organisation Against
Torture (OMCT), has received new information and requests your urgent
intervention in the following situation in Turkey.
 
New information:
 
The
Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the provisional release
of Mr. Raci Bilici, Vice-President
of the Human Rights Association (IHD) and Chairperson of IHD Diyarbakır. 
             
According
to the information received, on March 21, 2017, Mr. Raci Bilici was
interrogated by the Public Prosecutor in the morning, before being heard by the
Criminal Peace Judge on Duty in Diyarbakır in the afternoon. The court decided
to release Mr. Raci Bilici on condition of judicial control. As a consequence,
Mr. Raci Bilici is subjected to a travel ban and must check once a week at
Diyarbakır’s police station.
 
The Public
Prosecutor announced that he would pursue an investigation under the
Anti-Terrorism Law (Law 3713 of April 1991) for Mr. Bilici’s alleged “relations
with the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK)” punished by Article 314 of the Penal
Code and submit an indictment to the court. The exact reasons for the charges
remain unclear as the content of the case file remains confidential including
for his lawyer pursuant to the Article 153.2 of the Turkish Criminal Code
Procedure (No. 5271).
 
The
Observatory recalls in particular that the Anti-Terrorism Law has been
repeatedly used by the authorities as a tool to harass and imprison human
rights defenders.
 
Mr. Raci Bilici’s arrest took place against the
background of an increased repression against those who have expressed critical
views of the current administration, including human rights defenders,
following the July 15, 2016, failed coup, and in a particularly tense political
climate, ahead of the constitutional referendum set to take place on April 16,
2017. 
 
The Observatory fears that IHD’s monitoring of human
rights violations triggered the arrest of Mr. Raci Balici. Indeed, IHD had
recently provided information for a report by the Office of the United Nations
High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) exposing human rights violations in
South-East Turkey in relation to security operations conducted by the Turkish
authorities between July 2015 and December 2016. IHD’s inputs have been
crucial, since the OHCHR had been refused access by the Turkish authorities to
the South-East region to investigate into allegations of massive destructions,
killings and other serious human rights violations[1].

 
The Observatory
welcomes the provisional release of Mr. Raci Bilici but condemns the harassment, including at the judicial
level, targeting him and which only aims at sanctioning to his peaceful and
legitimate human rights activities. Accordingly, the Observatory calls
upon the Turkish judicial authorities to end all forms of harassment against Mr. Raci Bilici and to lift the travel
ban in force against him.
 
Background information:
 
On March
15, 2017 at 6:00 am, Mr. Raci Bilici was arrested at his house by five police
men and brought to the Diyarbakır Provincial Security Directorate Anti-Terror
Bureau. No reason was provided regarding
his arrest.
 
Mr. Raci Bilici was amongst the 4,350 teachers who
were suspended from duty in Turkey’s South-Eastern Diyarbakır province on
September 8, 2016, under Decree Law No. 677. The Ministry of National Education
alleged that these teachers “joined activities to prevent domestic operations
against terrorist organisations from being successful, failed curfews declared
in several districts and cities and violated the right to education”
 
Actions requested:
