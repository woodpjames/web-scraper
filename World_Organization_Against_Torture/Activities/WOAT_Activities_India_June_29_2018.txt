The Observatory for the Protection of
Human Rights Defenders, a partnership of the World Organisation Against Torture
(OMCT) and FIDH, requests your urgent intervention in the following situation
in India.
 
Brief description
of the information:
 
The Observatory has been informed by
reliable sources about the arbitrary detention and judicial harassment of Mr. S.
Vanchinathan,
a human rights lawyer practicing
at the Madras High Court’s Madurai Bench and the Tamil Nadu Coordinator of the
Human Rights Protection Council. 
 
According to the information received, on June 20, 2018 at 11.45 pm, Mr.
Vanchinathan was arrested without a warrant upon his arrival at Chennai airport
in Tamil Nadu State, India. He was arrested under
charges of “punishment for rioting” (Section 147 of the Penal Code), “rioting
armed with deadly weapons” (Section 148), “disobedience to orders duly
promulgated by public servants” (Section 188), “assault or criminal force to
deter a public servant from discharge of his duty” (Section 353), and “criminal
intimidation” (Section 506(2)), as well as under Section 3 of the Tamil Nadu
Public Property Prevention of Damage and Loss Act 1992.
 
At
the time of publication of this Urgent Appeal, Mr. S. Vanchinathan remained
detained at Palayamkottai jail.
 
The
charges relate to the May 22, 2018 protests against the Sterlite smelting mine,
which resulted in the death of 13 protesters following police use of force, in
Thoothukudi district, Tamil Nadu State[1].
Mr. Vanchinathan is one of the lawyers who provided legal aid to
protesters arrested by the Thoothukudi police after the anti-Sterlite protest
in Tuticorin turned violent.
 
Prior
to his arrest on June 20, 2018, Mr. Vanchinathan had filed a
petition for anticipatory bail before the Madurai Bench of the Madras High
Court, which was heard on June 18, 2018. His petition was dismissed by an oral
order of Justice G.R. Swaminathan although the
charges he faces do not amount to the minimum threshold required under Indian
criminal law to remand a suspect. Moreover, during the anticipatory bail hearing, the State’s
affidavit revealed the existence of eight other cases pending against Mr.
Vanchinathan, which were filed in 2012, 2015 and
2016, and are still in the first investigation report (FIR) stage.
 
The Observatory condemns the arbitrary detention and judicial harassment
of Mr. Vanchinathan, which seem aimed at hindering his
peaceful and legitimate human rights work.
 
The
Observatory urges the Indian authorities to release
Mr. Vanchinathan immediately and unconditionally, and to put an end to all acts
of harassment against him as well as all human rights defenders in India.


Actions requested: 
 
Please write to the authorities in India,
urging them to:
 
i.
Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr.
Vanchinathan and all human rights defenders in India;
 
ii.
Immediately and unconditionally release Mr. Vanchinathan as his detention is
arbitrary and merely aimed at punishing him for his legitimate human rights
activities;
 
iii.
Put an end to all acts of harassment - including at
the judicial level - against Mr. Vanchinathan as
well as against all human rights defenders in India, and ensure in all
circumstances that they are able to carry out their legitimate activities
without any hindrance and fear of reprisals;
 
iv. Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights
Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9,
1998, in particular with Articles 1, 12.1, and 12.2;
 
v. Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental
freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and
international instruments ratified by India.
 
Please also write to the National Human Rights
Commission of India, urging it to: 
 
vi. Exercise its powers under the Protection of
Human Rights Act, 1993, and immediately intervene in this case of Mr. Vanchinathan through an independent investigation from its Focal Point on Human
Rights Defenders.
