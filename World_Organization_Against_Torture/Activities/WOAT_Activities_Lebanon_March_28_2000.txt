Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel (PCATI), a member of the OMCT network, of the arrest of 3 Lebanese citizens.  According to the information received, Nimr Khaz'al, aged 48, Sawsan Khaz'al, his daughter, aged 27 and Munif Abbas Khalil, aged 55, all Lebanese citizens, were arrested by Israeli forces on 17th February 2000.  According to the information from PCATI, these detainees are now believed to be held at the Khiam Detention Center, infamous in its reputation of systematic torture and ill-treatment of detainees.  It has been further reported that they are all now at the Khiam Detention Camp. The Khiam camp is under control of the Israeli Occupation Forces.  Given the harsh conditions of detention at the Khiam Detention Camp, the International Secretariat is gravely concerned for their physical and psychological integrity.   OMCT underlines that the detention of these three people is the responsibility of the Israeli authorities and urges them to uphold their right to legal counsel and to a fair and impartial trial and their physical and psychological integrity, as established, inter alia, in the Convention against Torture and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, both ratified by Israel.  Action requested  Please write to the authorities in Israel urging them to:  i.	take all necessary measures to guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of the above-mentioned persons; ii.	order their immediate release in the absence of valid legal charges or, if such charges exist, bring them before an impartial and competent tribunal and guarantee their procedural rights at  all times; iii.	guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards ratified by Israel, particularly the Convention Against Torture.
