Description of the situation The Observatory was informed by Human Rights in China (HRIC) about the arbitrary arrest of Mr. Teng Biao, a Beijing-based rights defence lawyer and academic, who was awarded the Human Rights Prize of the French Republic in December 2007. According to the information received, on the evening of March 6, 2008, Mr. Teng was abducted into an unmarked black car. No information on his whereabouts could be obtained until his release, on March 8, 2008. In the framework of his abduction, Mr. Teng was reportedly questioned by officers from the Beijing Public Security Bureau in an unknown location about essays that he wrote and other “activities”. He was released after having spent forty hours in custody. At the end of 2007, Mr. Teng and Mr. Hu Jia, a Beijing-based HIV/AIDS activist, co-founder and former director of the Beijing Aizhixing Institute for Health Education[1], had co-written a open letter criticising the human rights record of pre-Olympic China. Mr. Teng has also written other recent essays critical of the Communist Party’s policies in human rights and rule of law. In particular, Mr. Teng filed a petition to the national legislature challenging the Custody and Repatriation System (for controlling population movement), which was eventually abolished. The Observatory expresses its concern about Mr. Teng Biao’s arbitrary arrest, which seems to merely aim at sanctioning his human rights activities, as well as about the ongoing harassment against Chinese human rights defenders. The Observatory also wishes to recall that the National People’s Congress amended the Chinese Constitution in 2004 to include that “the State respects and safeguards human rights” and that in April 2006, China submitted a document to the UN in order to support its candidacy to the Human Rights Council’s first election[2], in which it affirmed that the amendment to the Constitution was aiming at “defining the position of human rights in the overall national development strategy”. The Observatory further wishes to point out that, as a member of the Human Rights Council, China “shall uphold the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights”[3]. Actions requested: Please write to the authorities in the People’s Republic of China, urging them to:   Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Teng Biao;  Put an end to any act of harassment against Mr. Teng Biao and all human rights defenders in China;  Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, Article 11 which reads that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to the lawful exercise of his or her occupation or profession” and Article 12.2, which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”;  Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by the People’s Republic of China.
