CASE GRE 300114
HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENDERS
Judicial harassment
 
The
International Secretariat of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT)
requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in Greece.
 
Brief description of the situation:
The
International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Greek Helsinki
Monitor (GHM), a member of OMCT SOS-Torture network, about the ongoing judicial
harassment against Mr. Panayote Dimitras, GHM Spokesperson and
a member of OMCT General Assembly.
According
to the information received, on January 14, 2014, Mr. Panayote Dimitras received
an indictment from the Misdemeanours Prosecutor of Athens, summoning him on
February 27, 2014 before the 9th Chamber of the Three-Members
Misdemeanours Court to stand trial on charges of “perjury” (article 224 of the
Criminal Code) against and “defamation” (articles 362 and 363 of the Criminal
Code) of Mr. Konstantinos Plevris, a member lawyer of the Athens
Bar Association.
 
Mr.
Dimitras is accused of having knowingly committed perjury and made a false
statement as he was questioned as a witness before the First Chamber of the
Five Members Appeals Court of Athens on January 23, 2009, during a hearing of a
case against Mr. Konstantinos Plevris, who then stood accused of violating
articles 1 paragraphs 1 and 2 of Law 927/1979 “on punishing acts or activities aiming at racial
discrimination”[1].
During the hearing, Mr. Dimitras testified that “during the
last two months Mr. Plevris ha[d] threatened [his]
life”. Yet the indictment accuses Mr. Dimitras of making a false statement that
could harm the honour and reputation of Mr. Plevris while knowing that it was
untrue.
 
The International
Secretariat of OMCT is concerned that Mr. Panayote Dimitras received this
indictment merely one week before the charges become time-barred. Although the
events took place in January 2009 and a preliminary investigation took place in
February 2010, suddenly charges are pressed and Mr. Dimitras is referred to
trial. In addition, as Mr. Dimitras was summoned before the five-year
prescription period, which was ending on January 23, 2014, the prescription
period is now extended by three years.

OMCT is concerned about these new acts of
harassment against Mr. Panayote Dimitras, which seems to merely aim at
sanctioning his human rights activities, and in particular his activities
against discrimination, anti-Semitism and minority rights in Greece, and calls
upon the Greek authorities to ensure that he is able to carry out his legitimate
activities without any hindrance and fear of reprisals.

OMCT
recalls that this is not the first time that Mr. Panayote Dimitras is facing
judicial harassment by Mr. Konstantinos Plevris, who has been referred to trial
several times for, among others, violation of [anti-racism] Law 927/79,
concurrent aggravated defamation, and false accusation following GHM complaints[2].
 
Action requested:
 
Please write to the authorities in Greece, urging them to:
 
i. Put an end to any kind of harassment - including at the judicial
level - against Mr. Panayote Dimitras and more generally against all
human rights defenders in Greece;

ii.
Ensure in all circumstances that all human rights defenders in Greece are able
to carry out their legitimate activities without any hindrance and fear of
reprisals;
 
iii.
Conform to the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders,
adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998,
especially:
-
its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in
association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and
realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and
international levels”, as well as
-
its Article 12.2, which provides that the State shall “take all necessary
measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone,
individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats,
retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other
arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of his or
her rights”; 
 
iv.
Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms
in accordance with international human rights standards and international
instruments ratified by Greece.
