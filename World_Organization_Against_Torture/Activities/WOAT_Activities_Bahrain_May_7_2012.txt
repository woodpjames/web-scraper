Arbitrary detention / Judicial harassment
Bahrain
May 7, 2012
 
The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint 
programme of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World 
Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent intervention in the 
following situation in Bahrain.
 
Description of the situation:
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the 
arbitrary arrest and judicial harassment of Mr. Nabeel Rajab, President of the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights (BCHR), Director 
of the Gulf Centre for Human Rights (GCHR) and FIDH Deputy Secretary 
General.
 
According to the information received, on May 5, 2012, Mr. Nabeel 
Rajab was arrested by plain clothes police officers upon arrival at Manama 
airport from Lebanon and transferred to Al Hawra police station. The police 
officers who proceeded to the arrest stated that they were following orders by 
the Public Prosecutor, however neither Mr. Rajab nor his lawyers were then 
informed of the reasons for his arrest. 
 
Mr. Rajab had returned to Bahrain in order to attend an hearing for 
charges of “participating in an illegal assembly” and “calling others to join”, 
relating to a protest organised on March 31, 2012 in Manama to denounce the 
detention of human rights defender Abdulhadi Al Khawaja, Founder of GCHR, former BCHR President and former MENA Director at 
Front Line. 
 
On May 6, Mr. Rajab was accordingly taken to court, where he denied 
the charges against him. The trial was postponed to May 22, 
2012.
 
Later the same day, Mr. Rajab was presented before the Public 
Prosecutor, who informed him of the reasons for his arrest. According to Mr. 
Rajab's lawyers, charges of “insulting the statutory bodies”, pursuant to 
Article 216 of the Penal Code, which carry an imprisonment for a term of up to 
three years and a fine, are pressed against him in relation to tweets he posted 
deemed “insulting” to the Ministry of Interior. Mr. Rajab replied that he was 
the author of tweets posted through his account and that he did not recognise 
the jurisdiction of the Court and the Prosecution due to their lack of 
independence from the Executive. The Public Prosecutor remanded Mr. Rajab to 
detention for seven days.
 
The Observatory firmly denounces the arbitrary detention as well as 
the judicial harassment of Mr. Nabeel Rajab, which seem to merely aim at 
sanctioning his legitimate human rights activities. It recalls that according to 
international standards pre-trial detention should only be used where other 
measures of restraint are not possible.
 
The Observatory recalls that these events occur within the context of 
an intensified crackdown against activists, including human rights defenders, 
who have supported or are alleged to have supported the protest movement which 
started in Bahrain in February 2011.
 
Actions requested: The Observatory urges the authorities of Bahrain to: 

 
i.         
Guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Nabeel 
Rajab and all human rights defenders in Bahrain; 
 
ii.       
Release Mr. Nabeel 
Rajab immediately and unconditionally as his detention seems to 
merely sanction his human rights activities and is contrary to national and 
international law;
 
iii.      
Put an end to any acts of harassment, including at the judicial 
level, against Mr. Nabeel Rajab and against all human rights defenders in 
Bahrain; 
iv.     Conform in any circumstances with the provisions of the Declaration 
on Human Rights Defenders, adopted on December 9, 1998 by the United Nations 
General Assembly, in particular : its Article 1, which states that “everyone 
has the right, individually or in association with others, to promote the 
protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the 
national and international levels” ;
-          
its Article 6 (c) which states that “everyone has the right, 
individually and in association with others to study, discuss, form and hold 
opinions on the observance, both in law and in practice, of all human rights and 
fundamental freedoms and, through these and other appropriate means, to draw 
public attention to those matters” ;
-          
and its Article 12.2 which states that “the State shall take all 
necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of 
everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, 
threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or 
any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of 
the rights referred to in the present Declaration”.
 
vi.    Ensure in all 
circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance 
with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified 
by Bahrain.
