The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights
Defenders, a joint programme of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT)
and the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), requests your urgent
intervention in the following situation in The Philippines.
 
Brief description of the situation:
 
The
Observatory has been informed by the Task Force Detainees of the Philippines
(TFDP), the Medical Action Group (MAG) and the Alliance for
Advancement of People's Rights (KARAPATAN) about the extra-judicial killing of Mr.
Menelao "Boy" Barcia,
a farmer leader, Barangay Councillor and a leader of the Alliance of United
People of Hacienda Dolores (Alyansa ng Nagkakaisang Mamamayan ng Hacienda
Dolores - ANIBAN)[1],
in Porac, Pampanga province. 
 
According to the information received, on May 2, 2014, at
around 9 p.m, Mr. Menelao "Boy" Barcia picked up his wife Maria
at a gas station in Angeles City where she worked. While
driving their jeep back to Barangay Hacienda Dolores, four men on two
motorcycles drove alongside them. The men fired at Mr. Barcia's vehicle. Mr. Barcia
sustained four gunshot wounds - three in the chest and one at the back of his
head - and was rushed to the hospital, where he was declared dead
on arrival. His wife survived the attack with gunshots in her foot that need
surgery.
 
Mr. Barcia
was organising the farmers of Hacienda Dolores against LLL Holdings
Incorporated (LLHI) and FL properties and Management Corporation (now
Terrafirma Holdings Inc.), which claim ownership of their ancestral domain.
 
The
Observatory condemns in the strongest term the extra-judicial killing of Mr.
Menelao "Boy" Barcia, and calls upon the authorities of the
Philippines to conduct an immediate, thorough, effective,
and impartial investigation in order to identify all those responsible, bring
them before a civil competent and impartial tribunal and apply the penal
sanctions provided by the law.
 
Action requested:

i.   Guarantee in all
circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of all human rights
defenders in the Philippines;
 
ii.  Order an immediate,

killing of Mr. Menelao "Boy" Barcia in
order to identify all those responsible, bring them before an independent

iii. Provide adequate
reparation and compensation to Mr. Menelao "Boy" Barcia’s
relatives;
 
iv. Put an end to any kind

legitimate activities without any hindrance and fear of reprisals;
