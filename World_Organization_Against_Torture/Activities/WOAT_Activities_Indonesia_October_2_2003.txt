Brief description of the situation:  OMCT has been informed by a reliable source about the disappearance of Ms. Cut Rostina Ismail, the wife of a commander of the Free Aceh Movement (GAM), Mr. Teungku Ishak Daud. The information received indicates that the Indonesian military is responsible for these disappearances.   On September 21, 2003, the wife of GAM officer Teungku Ishak Daud, Cut Rostina Ismail, and her two children, a 2 year old boy and a 9 month old baby, were arrested in their house. Military operation spokesman Lt. Col. Ahmad Yani Basuki admitted on Tuesday, that the military arrested Cut Rostina Ismail but claimed that she had been released on Monday, and she and the children were brought to her parents-in-laws house in the village of Tepian Jaring Kuala. According to the spokesman the military had earlier received information that her husband, was present at the house.   However, according to Teungku Ishak Daud, he is not aware of the whereabouts of his wife and children.  The information received indicates that the arrest of wives of the leaders of GAM has been a systematic tactic of the Indonesian military in an effort to obtain information about the rebel group.   OMCT is deeply concerned for the physical and psychological integrity of Ms. Cut Rostina Ismail and her two children and calls upon the government of Indonesia to locate and release her and the children immediately in the absence of valid charges against them. OMCT is also gravely concerned that wives and children are being used as tools to get to rebel leaders and firmly condemns such military practices.   Action Requested  Please write to the authorities in Indonesia urging them to:  i.	immediately locate the whereabouts of Mrs. Cut Rostina Ismail and her children. ii.	initiate a prompt, impartial and full investigation into the disappearance of Ms. Cut Rostina Ismail and her children and hold the responsible persons accountable; iii.	guarantee adequate reparation to Ms. Cut Rostina Ismail and her family; iv.	take all necessary measures to prevent such violence in the future;  v.	guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
