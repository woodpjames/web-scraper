Brief description of the situation The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by a reliable source about the arbitrary arrest and subsequent judicial proceedings of several members of the National Constitutional Assembly (NCA), a grouping of independent NGOs, dedicated to the promotion of democracy and the rule of law in Zimbabwe.    According to the information received, on 13 July 2006, Mr. Future Matondo, Mr. Alinmah T. Munafireyi Rajabo, Ms. Florence Bundo, Mr. Tapuwa Mundangepfupfu, Mr. Shelter Zimunhu, Mr. Albert Mhetu, Mr. Louis Chizaka, Ms. Shelly Saburi, Mr. Stewart Muzhambi and Ms. Ruth Katsande, 10 members of the National Constitutional Assembly (NCA), were arrested in Mutare, while protesting in favour of a constitutional reform. The activists were the charged under Section 37 of the Criminal Law Act Chapter 9:23, which criminalises a demonstration that poses a realised risk to public disorder. They were all released on bail for an amount of ZW$ 500 000 each. The hearing is scheduled on 31 July 2006.   Moreover, on 12 July 2006, 128 NCA members, including four women with infants, were arrested in Harare and detained at the Harare Central police station. They were charged under Section 46 of the Criminal Law Act (9:23) as read with paragraph 2(a) of the Third Schedule to that Act, which is reminiscent of the Miscellaneous Offences Act (MOA) and relates to obstruction of streets and traffic. Section 46 itself states that “any person who does any act specified in the 3rd Schedule shall be guilty of nuisance and liable to a fine or a fine together with six months imprisonment”. One of the activists, Ms. Evidence John, collapsed due to hunger and inhabitable conditions of detention at the Harare Central Police Station cells and was further denied access to medical treatment, unimpeded access to legal representation and food. On 15 July 2006, all NCA members were released on free bail.   The 128 NCA activists were supposed to appear at the Rotten Row Magistrates Court on 20 July 2006, but the hearing was postponed to 4 August 2006, because a public prosecutor who served at the Magistrates Court died.
