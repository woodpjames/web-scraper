New information: The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the end of the judicial proceedings against Mr. Pepe Julian Onziema, Ms. Valentine Kalende and Mr. Usaam Mukwaya, alias Auf, three Ugandan LGBT and HIV/AIDS activists. According to the information received, on August 15, 2008, the prosecution told the Buganda road court that the Director of Public Prosecution (DPP) had dropped the charges of trespass against Mr. Pepe Juliana Onziema, Ms. Valentine Kalende and Mr. Usaam Mukwaya. The magistrate court therefore dismissed the charges against the three and acquitted them. The Observatory welcomes the end of the judicial proceedings against Mr. Pepe Juliana Onziema, Ms. Valentine Kalende and Mr. Usaam Mukwaya, and wishes to thank all the persons, organisations, and institutions that intervened in their favour. Background information: On June 4, 2008, Mr. Pepe Julian Onziema, Ms. Valentine Kalende and Mr. Usaam Mukwaya were arrested by the Uganda Police Force at the 2008 HIV/AIDS Implementers’ Meeting, taking place in Kampala, Uganda, from June 3 to 7, 2008. Along with other LGBT and HIV/AIDS activists, they were peacefully protesting against statements made by a Ugandan Government official that no funds would be directed toward HIV programmes benefiting to men who have sex with men. Indeed, on May 2, 2008, Mr. Kihumuro Apuuli, Director General of the Uganda AIDS Commission, stated that “gays are one of the drivers of HIV in Uganda, but because of meagre resources we cannot direct our programmes at them at this time”. The LGBT activists, including members of Sexual Minorities Uganda (SMUG), staged a peaceful protest at the HIV Implementers meeting to protest against the Minister’s statements and in a more general way the absence of response of the Ugandan Government to a growing HIV epidemic among the country’s LGBT community. After they started distributing leaflets and holding up small placards demanding attention to HIV vulnerability among LGBT, Mr. Pepe Julian Onziema, Ms. Valentine Kalende and Mr. Usaam Mukwaya were arrested and immediately brought to the Jinja Road Police Station. On June 6, 2008, the three defenders were released on a bail of 500,000 UGX (310 USD). However, they remain charged with “criminal trespass”, under Section 302 of the Ugandan Penal Code. The case was adjourned to June 20, 2008. On June 7, 2008, Mr. Usaam Mukwaya was re-arrested at the HIV Implementers’ Meeting in Kampala, before being released after four hours in police custody and was charged with “forgery”. He was ordered by the police to return to the station on June 10, 2008. On that date, he reported at the police station, and the forgery charges were dropped. On June 20, 2008, Mr. Pepe Julian Onziema, Ms. Valentine Kalende and Mr. Usaam Mukwaya appeared in Court at 9:30 am, at the Buganda Road Magistrate’s Court in Kampala. The hearing for “criminal trespass” did not take place because the State witnesses were not in court for the hearing. The Magistrate then requested the Public Prosecutor to inform her why the State witnesses were not present for the hearing. The Public Prosecutor informed the Magistrate that one of the State witnesses was not feeling well and that he had a problem of back ache. The second State witness’ mobile phone was switched off. The lawyer of Mr. Pepe Julian Onziema, Ms. Valentine Kalende and Mr. Usaam Mukwaya requested the Magistrate to dismiss the case on grounds of the Sate witnesses not being serious with the case, as well as lack of enough evidence. However, the Magistrate adjourned the hearing to July 8, 2008. The defendants last appeared before a Kampala court on July 25, where several witnesses of the state and the defendants were cross-examined. The judge adjourned the hearing until August 1, 2008. At previous hearings held on July 9 and 10, the judge adjourned the case following the public prosecutor’s request to give police additional time to locate new witnesses. The defendants’ lawyer presented the defendants’ conference registration forms signed by the US Global AIDS Coordinator, and a support letter signed by all the conference organizers as evidence before the court. On July 25, 2008, a few hours after a hearing in the case, Kampala policemen abducted Auf, as he is known to his friends, an activist with Sexual Minorities Uganda (SMUG), a local organisation advocating on behalf of Uganda’s LGBT people, on his way back to the Speke Hotel. A patrol car stopped the motor taxi he was riding and four men identifying themselves as police officers took him to an undisclosed location. He was held for more than 24 hours without access to a lawyer or any reason provided for his arrest. During that time he was seriously ill-treated. His abductors asked him questions in Luganda, a local language, about the activists’ funders and supporters, and about his own role “among the homosexuals”. They also demanded information from him about other individuals and their work for LGBT rights. According to Auf, three police officers (one man and two women) pushed him through a dark corridor into a room where they made him sit on a chair. Auf saw four other men around his age in the room. One had a broken leg and the other three appeared to have been beaten. One of the women officers scraped his knuckles with a razor-like object; later, the man tied him to a machine that stretched his arms. At dawn, before releasing him, they forced him to strip to his underwear, asked him if he was a man or a woman, and made him walk around the room in his underwear. The following day, they dropped him at Mulago round-about in central Kampala.
