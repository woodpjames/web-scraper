The Observatory for the Protection
of Human Rights Defenders, a partnership of FIDH and the World Organisation
Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent intervention in the following
situation in Turkey.
 
Description
of the situation:
 
The
Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the arbitrary arrest
and detention of eight human rights defenders, namely: Ms. Nalan Erkem, lawyer with the Citizens Assembly, Ms. Özlem
Dalkıran, member of the Citizens
Assembly, Ms. İlknur Üstün,
member of the Women’s Coalition, Ms. Idil Eser, Director of Amnesty
International Turkey, Mr. Günal Kurşun, lawyer
with the Human Rights Agenda Association, Mr. Veli Acu, member of the
Human Rights Agenda Association, Mr. Nejat Taştan, member of
Equal Rights Watch Association, Mr. Şeyhmuz Özbekli, trainee lawyer and
member of the Rights Initiative, as well as Mr. Ali Gharawi and Mr. Peter
Steudtner, security consultants[1].
 
According to the information received, on July 5,
2017, the eight human rights defenders were arrested following a police raid
during a digital security and information management workshop organised by the
Citizens Assembly[2]
in Büyükada, Istanbul. As of publication of this Urgent Appeal, the eight human
rights defenders were being detained in different police stations across town
and scheduled to be transferred on July 7, 2017 to Istanbul Directorate of
Security on Vatan Street.
 
Under
Turkey’s state of emergency, they will not be given access to their lawyers and
family for at least 24 hours. On July
6, 2017, after 24 hours, their detention was extended for seven days.
 
It has been reported that they are being
investigated for “membership of an illegal-armed organisation” under Article
314/2 of the Turkish Penal Code by the Istanbul Ssecurity
Ddirectorate.
 
The
Observatory expresses its deepest concerns over this new wave of arbitrary
arrests targeting human rights defenders for the exercise of their legitimate
and peaceful human rights activities and obstacles to freedoms of association
and peaceful assembly[3].
 
The
Observatory urges Turkish authorities to grant Nalan Erkem, Özlem Dalkıran, İlknur Üstün, Idil Eser,
Günal Kurşun, Veli Acu, Nejat Taştan, Şeyhmuz Özbekli, Ali Gharawi and Peter
Steudtner immediate access to their lawyers and to immediately and
unconditionally release them.
 
Actions requested: 
 
Please
write to the authorities in Turkey, urging them to:
 
i. Guarantee, in all
circumstances, the physical and psychological integrity of Nalan Erkem, Özlem
Dalkıran, İlknur Üstün, Idil Eser, Günal Kurşun, Veli Acu, Nejat Taştan,
Şeyhmuz Özbekli, Ali Gharawi and Peter Steudtner, as well as of
all human rights defenders in Turkey;
 
ii. Immediately and
unconditionally release Nalan Erkem, Özlem Dalkıran, İlknur Üstün, Idil Eser,
Günal Kurşun, Veli Acu, Nejat Taştan, Şeyhmuz Özbekli, Ali Gharawi, and Peter
Steudtner as their detention is arbitrary since it only aims at punishing them for their
legitimate human rights activities; 
 
iii. Immediately allow Nalan Erkem, Özlem
Dalkıran, İlknur Üstün, Idil Eser, Günal Kurşun, Veli Acu, Nejat Taştan,
Şeyhmuz Özbekli, Ali Gharawi, and Peter Steudtner to access their
family and lawyers and guarantee their right to due process and a fair trial;
 
iv. Comply with all the
provisions of the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted
by the UN General Assembly on December 9, 1998, in particular its Articles 1,
6(a), 9, 11 and 12.2;
 
v. Ensure in all
circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance
with international human rights standards and international instruments
ratified by Turkey.
