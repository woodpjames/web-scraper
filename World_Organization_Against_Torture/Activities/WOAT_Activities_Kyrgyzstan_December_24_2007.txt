New information  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Kyrgyz Committee for Human Rights (KCHR), a member of the OMCT SOS-Torture network, that an investigation was reportedly launched by law enforcement agency into the death of 83-year-old Mr. Belek Arziev but no information was provided as to its current status. However, there are fears that the investigation is not properly conducted.  The International Secretariat of OMCT expresses again its deep concern over the circumstances of the death of Mr. Belek Arziev and the risk of impunity. OMCT recalls that Kyrgyzstan is a State party to the UN Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which both prohibit torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. Moreover, according to article 9 1) of the ICCPR no one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest or detention.

Maksutov, Sergeant T. Nurkulov, Sergeant B. Orozov and Sergeant T. Kadyrov on 27 June 2007.  Mr. Belek Arziev was reportedly accused of not carrying identification papers with him. The policemen allegedly tried to bribe him in exchange of not arresting him. When Mr. Arziev reportedly refused to pay, the four policemen started to beat him on the head and the chest. They also reportedly seized him 50’000 Kyrgyz soms.  According to the information, Mr. Belek Arziev’s corpse was found on 28 June 2007 in the A. Navoi Park in Osh city.
