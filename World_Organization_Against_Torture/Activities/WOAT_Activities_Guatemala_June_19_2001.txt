New Information  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by Casa Alianza, a member of the OMCT network, of the arrest of private policeman Juan Francisco López Cano for the rape and attempted murder of 18 year-old street girl Sandra Herlinda Ponceano Ichiche.   According to the information received, last week agents from the Sexual Crimes and Criminal Investigation Service of the national civil police arrested the accused in zone 11 of Guatemala City. Investigations concerning the other suspect in the case are continuing.  Brief reminder of the situation  According to the information received, an 18 year-old girl was raped and shot in the throat in the early hours of 9 May 2001, in Guatemala City, by two private policemen from the Galil security guard company. The victim, a street child named Sandra Herlinda Ponceano Ichiche, was in an abandoned building at the corner of 6th Avenue and 24th street in Zone 4 of Guatemala City with several other children when two armed men entered the building and demanded that the children give them drugs or a girl with whom to have sex, while threatening them with their guns. The men then closed in on Sandra, put a gun to her head and took her away to the adjacent former Banco de la Vivienda (BANVI) building, which the men were supposed to be guarding.   According to the other children, who will remain anonymous for their own safety, the men took Sandra up to the third floor of the BANVI building and kept her there for 30-45 minutes. During this time, Sandra was reportedly raped by the policeman wearing plain clothes, while the uniformed policeman held her down. The men then shot Sandra in the throat after she cried out for help, and left her there bleeding profusely.  One of the street children called for an ambulance after the men had left, and ten minutes later Sandra was transported to the San Juan de Dios hospital in a critical condition, where she underwent emergency surgery. Fortunately, the bullet missed her artery and bones, and she is now out of danger. She has subsequently been released into Casa Alianza’s care.
