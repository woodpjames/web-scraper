During its 63rd Session (23 April – 18 May 2018), the
Committee Against Torture (CAT) considered the State party reports of Norway,
Senegal, Belarus, Qatar, Czech Republic and Tajikistan. In accordance with
Article 19 of the Convention Against Torture, every four years State Parties
submit a report to the CAT on new measures taken to implement the Convention.
These reports are reviewed in public sessions, during which the respective State
party holds a constructive dialogue with the Committee Members. The day before
the consideration of the report, NGOs having submitted an alternative report
can raise their concerns during a private briefing with the CAT. At the end of
each session, the CAT publishes its « Concluding
Observations », which are specific recommendations for each
reviewed State and issues for them to follow up on within one year. During this
session, the discussions covered a broad range of topics, from the poor
conditions in detention and the treatment of migrants, to gender-based violence.
