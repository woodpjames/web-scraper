Brussels
18 May 2015. Torture and ill-treatment including electric shock,
suffocation, rape and beatings continue to be widely used in Kyrgyzstan and
impunity is the norm. Central Asian and international human rights
organizations are calling on the European Union to use the Human Rights
Dialogue, that takes place in Brussels today, to raise pressing concerns and
individual torture cases, in line with the EU Guidelines to Policy towards
Third Countries on Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or
Punishment. They insist the EU should work in close cooperation with the
Government of Kyrgyzstan toward prevention and eradication of torture and
ill-treatment in the country. In addition, the organizations are calling on
Kyrgyzstan to commit to concrete steps to end torture and other forms of
ill-treatment. 
 
On the
occasion of the EU-Kyrgyz Republic Human Rights Dialogue the coalitions against
torture in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, the Helsinki Foundation for
Human Rights (HFHR, Poland), International Partnership for Human Rights (IPHR,
Belgium) and the World Organisation against Torture (OMCT) jointly issued a
document, entitled “Torture
in Kyrgyzstan: Current concerns and recommendations”. It summarizes positive
steps taken by the authorities of Kyrgyzstan in recent years, identifies
serious gaps and weaknesses that persist in the legislative and institutional
frameworks, and it focuses on how the failure to consistently implement
existing legislation contributes to on-going torture and impunity.
 
In
2014, the NGO Coalition against Torture in Kyrgyzstan documented over 80 cases
of men, women and children who are believed to have been subjected to torture
or other forms of ill-treatment and urged prosecutor’s offices to conduct
effective investigations into the allegations. Although the strength of
evidence in support of the allegations available to the Coalition in these
cases is high, criminal cases were opened in only 16 of them and only very few
police officers were convicted.
 
Among
dozens of cases of torture and ill-treatment documented by NGOs in Kyrgyzstan
in recent years is that of Yuri Marchenko from Tup village in the
north-eastern Issyk-Kul region, whom police abused on two separate occasions in
2011. In September 2011, several officers reportedly held him without contact
to the outside world for several hours and beat him. After his mother
complained to the head of the local police and the district prosecutor’s
office, he was released. In the night of 21 November, when returning home on
his motorbike, Yuri was stopped by five men, some of whom he recognized as
officers of Tup police station. The men reportedly beat him so severely with
fists and metal objects that he lost consciousness. Police left him lying in
the snow. He was believed to have been targeted to punish his family for filing
complaints about the police abuse in September. Yuri Marchenko was hospitalized
for two weeks and doctors recorded fractures in his nose and two rib bones,
other injuries to his chest and head and bruises and abrasions in different
parts of his body.
 
A
criminal investigation was opened, but it was closed in April 2013 for “lack of
evidence of a crime”. The criminal case was reopened in June 2013 and charges
were brought against three officers. The trial made little progress as the
defendants failed to appear in court for trial for many months. Finally, the
court issued two defendants with a warning to ensure that they appear in court.
The trial started in April 2014 and is still on going. A fourth alleged
perpetrator was issued with a search warrant but is still at large. The
Coalition against Torture in Kyrgyzstan is aware of many trials in
torture-related cases that have not progressed for years. We therefore
believe that international attention to this case is needed to ensure that the
perpetrators are swiftly brought to justice.
 
We are
concerned that the Criminal Procedure Code does not provide detainees with
basic safeguards from the moment of de facto apprehension, such as access to a
lawyer of their choice, access to independent medical examination and
notification of family. Police routinely hold detainees in basements, traffic
police cars or offices of police stations in the first hours, sometimes even
days, of detention. There, police frequently subject them to torture or
ill-treatment and force them to sign a confession, before placing them into a
temporary detention facility (IVS) and recording their detention.
 
In
Kyrgyzstan detainees do not undergo an independent routine medical examination
upon admission to the IVS (run by the Ministry of Internal Affairs) and to
investigation isolation facilities (SIZOs, run by the Government Service for
the Execution of Punishments at the President’s Office). Medical personnel in
these detention facilities lack independence as they are employed by the
institution that runs the respective facility. The Coalition against Torture in
Kyrgyzstan has documented many cases in recent years where medical personnel both
in IVS and SIZOs failed to record injuries sustained as a result of police
abuse. In those cases where IVS do not have their own medical attendants police
usually take detainees to local public health clinics where they are seen by
doctors or medical attendants for the legally required examination before
transferring them to an IVS. Sometimes the examination is conducted in the
presence of police officers. For fear of reprisals doctors often ignore
injuries likely sustained through torture and victims often refrain from
telling them about police abuse.
 
We are
also concerned that allegations of torture and other ill-treatment are usually
not investigated effectively and independently in Kyrgyzstan. The internal
security services of law enforcement agencies conduct a preliminary inquiry
into allegations of torture if victims submit their complaint to these agencies
that are implicated in the complaint. Due to the lack of impartiality of this
form of inquiry, the agencies usually conclude that the allegations have not
been substantiated. As a result, in the vast majority of cases, no criminal
proceedings are initiated.
 
Torture
complaints can also be submitted to prosecutors. However, prosecutors, like the
police, have an interest in reducing and resolving crime. In order to achieve
this goal prosecutors may be inclined to overlook human rights violations
committed by police, such as torture. Prosecutors and police from the same
regions frequently have close professional and sometimes even personal links, which
often poses an obstacle to thorough and impartial investigations into
violations committed by police.
 
Another
issue of concern is the lack of comprehensive reparation provided to torture
victims in Kyrgyzstan, which should include fair and adequate compensation and
rehabilitation for damages caused by torture and ill-treatment. While
international standards hold that the state is responsible for these damages
and must provide compensation, domestic legislation stipulates that civil
courts can order the perpetrator to provide compensation for harm suffered.
There have been some court decisions in recent years where perpetrators were
ordered to provide compensation to victims. However, to our knowledge, none of
the victims have yet received the payments.
 
Recommendations:

 
The
document “Torture in Kyrgyzstan: Current concerns and recommendation” concludes
with a list of recommendations to the authorities of Kyrgyzstan that, if
implemented, would significantly reduce incidents of torture and ill-treatment
in Kyrgyzstan. The following are key recommendations identified by the NGOs
issuing this statement that the authorities should implement as a matter of
priority:
 
•        
Amend domestic legislation to reflect that
detention starts from the moment of de facto apprehension and ensure that
detainees have access to basic safeguards such as access to a
lawyer of the detainee’s choice, access to an independent medical doctor and
notification of family as of that moment.
•        Introduce legislation to create and fund an independent
mechanism endowed with sufficient authority and competence to conduct
prompt, thorough and independent investigations into allegations of torture
or other ill-treatment.
•        Ensure that there are clear provisions in domestic
legislation on the right of torture victims to reparation, including
fair and adequate compensation and rehabilitation for damages caused by
torture, regardless of whether perpetrators of such acts have been brought to
justice. In addition, amend legislation to ensure that the state has to
provide the compensation.

Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights

sole responsibility of the organizations issuing it and can under no
circumstances be regarded as reflecting the position of Open Society
Foundations.
