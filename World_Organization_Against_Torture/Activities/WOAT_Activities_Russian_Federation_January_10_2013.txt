This person suggested a meeting in ‘Shtab’ café, located in an unsafe area of Voronezh, to inform him “about the reasons of the threats” and “to prove that these threats are real”. Mr. Kozlov had received a previous call on December 5, 2012 from the same number and the same person. He had reported the incident to the police, but it is still unclear whether an investigation was opened into the matter. The Observatory strongly condemns these threats, and fears that they aim at sanctioning Mr. Kozlov's human rights activities.The Observatory calls for a thorough, impartial and transparent investigation into the above mentioned facts in order to identify all those responsible, bring them before a competent and impartial tribunal and apply to them the sanctions provided by the law.Actions requested:Please write to the authorities of Russian Federation, urging them to: i.
