New Information:  M. Nazmi Gür, Secretary General of the Turkish Association of Human Rights, member of the FIDH and OMCT, accused of « aiding a military organisation », was acquitted on 3rd February 2000 by State Security Court No.1 in Ankara «since there is no adequate and convincing evidence that prove any crime committed by the accused ».  During the trial, the Observatory mandated an observer, jointly with the Euro-Mediterranean Network of Human Rights.  The Observatory wishes to thank all groups, individuals and institutions who intervened in his favour.   Brief reminder of the situation :  The Observatory for the protection of Human Rights was informed that legal proceedings had begun in front of the Ankara State Security Court n°1, against M Nazmi Gur, Secretary General of the Turkish Association of Human Rights (IHD), member of the FIDH.    According to the accusation emitted by the office of the Attorney at law, Nazmi Gur was accused of having « helped an armed organisation », after having drafted an article entitled « It is not hard to reach peace », published in the special bulletin of the IHD at the time of World Peace Day, 1 September 1999.  The use of expressions such as « the peoples’ of this country » as well as « a dirty war waged for the last 15 years » found these proceedings, in the name of the invisibility of the territory and of the Turkish nation (article 169 of the Turkish Penal Code and 5 of the anti-terror n°3713).  On this count, Nazmi Gur was passable for a penalty of 3 to 7,5 years in prison.    The Observatory considered that the pursuits infringed on the Declaration of the Defenders of Human Rights adopted on 9 December 1998  by the General Assembly of the United Nations, and notably by article 6 which states that «  Everyone has the right, individually and in association with others (...), to publish, impart or disseminate to others views, information and knowledge on all human rights and fundamental freedoms ».    Paris-Geneva, 7th February 2000  Kindly inform the Observatory of any action undertaken quoting the code number of this appeal in your reply.   The Observatory, an FIDH and OMCT venture, is dedicated to the protection of Human Rights Defenders and aims to offer them concrete support in their time of need.   The Observatory was the winner of the 1998 Human Rights Prize of the French Republic.
