Arbitrary
arrest and detention
Thailand
September

The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of
the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation
Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent intervention in the following
situation in Thailand.
 
Description of the situation:
 
The
Observatory has been informed by reliable sources of the arrest and detention
under the Martial Law of Mr. Thammarat Aliartae, a Malayu Thai human
rights defender in Yala province in southern Thailand. 
 
According
to the information received, on September 20, 2012, at approximately 7.00pm,
soldiers from Yala Task Force 11, a special unit of the Thai army, arrested Mr.
Aliartae near his house at the Old Market in Yala town. At the time of writing,
he was detained in a military base operated by Yala Task Force 11 in Muang
district in Yala and was denied access to his lawyer from his arrest until
approximately 9.00am on September 21, when his lawyer finally gained access to
him. Task Force 11 reportedly did not inform Mr. Aliartae or his lawyer of the
reason for his arrest.
 
Five
days before his arrest, on September 15, 2012, Mr. Aliartae, along with current
and former defendants in security-related cases and their families, submitted
complaint letters to and met with officials from the Southern Border Province
Administrative Center (SBPAC). At this meeting, Mr. Aliartae requested Pol.
Col. Tawee Sodsong, the Director General of SBPAC, to ensure people’s equal
access to justice. He also asked SBPAC to provide protection to defendants
released on bail or those already acquitted by the court in security-related
cases because these persons had been harassed, intimidated and sometimes
subjected to physical violence by security forces and unidentified persons.
After the SBPAC meeting, Mr. Aliartae gave interviews to Thai-language media
and his comments were published online.
 
The
meeting followed three recent fatal shootings of current or former defendants
in security-related cases in the southern border provinces. The incident
occurred on July 26, 2012, when Mr. Abduloh Jaetimae was shot dead by
unidentified gunmen in Tambon Yaha, Yala province. Mr. Jaetimae had been
arrested and prosecuted in 2006 for his alleged involvement in planting a bomb
in a bank; after spending three years in detention pending the outcome of his
trial, he was acquitted and released in 2010. 

 
Mr.
Aliartae is a schoolteacher in Yala town, Yala province. In 2007, Mr. Aliartae,
then a university student, was arrested along with six others under the special
security laws and accused of being involved in a bombing in Yala. He reported
having been ill treated while in detention. He was later released on bail in
2010, but his trial has not been concluded and the charges against him still
stand. Mr. Aliartae has since been advocating for the rights of persons
affected by the implementation of special security laws (the Martial Law, the
Emergency Decree, and the Internal Security Act), and by abuses perpetrated by
State security forces in the southern border provinces. 
 
Mr.
Aliartae has also been active in supporting the families of those detained
under the special security laws. In August 2012, Mr. Aliartae wrote a letter to
the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD)
when it considered Thailand’s combined 1st to 3rd
periodic reports. The letter asked CERD to take actions to address the violence
and abuses affecting populations in the southern border provinces, especially
Malayu Thais.  
 
In
its Concluding Observations on August 31, 2012, CERD expressed its serious
concern “at the discriminatory impact of the application of the special laws in
force in the Southern Border Provinces, including reports of identity checks
and arrests carried out on the basis of racial profiling, as well as reports of
torture and enforced disappearance of Malayu Thais. The Committee is further
concerned at the risk of serious human rights violations in the enforcement of
these laws as well as at the absence of a mechanism of oversight of their
application”[1].
 
The
formulation and application of Thailand’s broadly worded special security laws,
including the Martial Law, Emergency Decree, and Internal Security Act (ISA),
are not consistent with international human rights law and standards, including
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which
Thailand is a State party.
 
Under
the 1914 Martial Law Act, a person can be detained without a warrant for
interrogation purposes up to seven days, without recourse to judicial review.
The Emergency Decree gives the Prime Minister the power to authorise a
“competent official” to arrest and detain a person for seven days, extendable
to up to 30 days in total on the condition that extensions are authorised by
the courts. However, the Emergency Decree does not explicitly guarantee the
right of detainees to be brought promptly before a judge in order to determine
the legality and necessity of detention, as guaranteed under Article 9.3 of the
ICCPR. Both the Martial Law and the Emergence Decree are concurrently enforced
in Yala province, and a person can be held in custody up to 37 days without
charge. Prolonged detention without charge in unofficial detention facilities
significantly increases the risks of torture and ill-treatment. 
 
These
draconian laws provide for exceptional and discretionary arrest and detention
powers to State officials, especially the military, and allow them to wield
these powers without adequate oversight by the judiciary or other independent
bodies. The application of these laws has often failed to meet the strict tests
of legality, necessity and proportionality. Their imposition in Narathiwat,
Pattani, Yala and several districts in Songkla provinces has also failed to
contribute to building peace and security in those areas. Since July 2012, the
security situation in the Deep South has markedly deteriorated and there has
been a spate of violent incidents that resulted in a number of deaths and
injuries, including of civilians, security forces and suspected insurgents.
 
Actions requested:
 
Please write to the Thai
authorities and ask them to:
 
i.  Release Mr. Thammarat Aliartae immediately
and unconditionally as his detention is arbitrary since it only aims at
sanctioning his human rights activities and put an end to all acts of
harassment – including at the judicial level – against him;
 
ii.  
Guarantee
in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Aliartae
and all human rights
defenders and their organisations in Thailand;
 
iii. Conform with the provisions of the
Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted on December 9, 1998 by the
United Nations General Assembly, and in particular :
-     
Article
1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually or in association
with others, to promote the protection and realization of human rights and
fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, 
-   
 and Article 12.2 which provides that “the State
shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent
authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against
any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination,
pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her
legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”.
 
iv. Ensure in all
circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance
with international human rights standards and international instruments
ratified by Thailand.
