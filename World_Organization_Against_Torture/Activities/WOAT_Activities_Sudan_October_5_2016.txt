The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a partnership of FIDH
and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent
intervention in the following situation in Sudan.
Description of the situation:
The
Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the judicial harassment
against five human right defenders working at the Centre for Training and Human
Development in Sudan (TRACKs)[1],
namely Mr. Al Hassan Kheiry, a computer technician,
Mrs. Arwa Elrabie, the
Administration Manager, Ms. Imani-Leyla Raye, a student volunteer, Mr. Khalafalla Al-Afif Mukhtar, the
Director, and Mr. Midhat A Hamdan, a
trainer, as well as against the Director of Zarqa Organisation for Rural
Development (ZORD) who had delivered training for TRACKs, Mr. Mustafa Adam, as
well as the arbitrary detention of the last three (see background information).
According
to the information received, on September 22 and 29, 2016, the six human rights
defenders were heard before the Khartoum Central Criminal Court for charges
under the 1991 Criminal Act of “undermining the constitutional system” (Article
50), “waging war against the State (Article 51), “espionage” (Article 53),
“criminal and terrorist organisation” (Article 65). Such offences are
classified as crimes against the State and carry the death penalty. Messrs
Midhat A Hamdan and Mustafa Adam are also facing charges under Article 14 of
the Information Crime Law.
These charges relate to accusations of producing, setting, sending, storing or
promoting indecent content through internet, computer or alike that affect
public order or morals. They carry sentences of imprisonment up to seven years
and a fine.
During
both the hearings, the Prosecutor showed a number of personal pictures and
materials found on the laptops of the defendants[2],
although completely
irrelevant to the charges and in blatant breach of their right to privacy and
property. The Observatory fears that these were shown in an attempt to question
the morality of the defendants. Furthermore, the Prosecutor claimed
TRACKs’ activities were used to carry on the work of the Al-khatim Aldan Center
for Enlightenment (KACE)[3]
despite being shut down by the authorities in 2012. 
The prosecutor also claimed that TRACKs was
operating without being registered as a training centre, since their licence
ended on March 27, 2015. However, TRACKs’ application to renew their licence in
due time, which included the payment of registration fees to the National
Centre for Training, has been delayed by the authorities due to “internal
issues”. The status of their application is therefore still pending, which
nonetheless enables TRACKs to legally operate under Sudanese legislation.
The hearing of September 29, which started with
two hours delay due to the late arrival of both Prosecutor and Investigator,
was eventually suspended due to a power cut. The next hearing is
scheduled to take place on October 6, 2016.
The Observatory urges the authorities to release
immediately Messrs. Khalafalla Al-Afif Mukhtar, Mustafa Adam and Midhat A
Hamdan and drop all the charges against them and Messrs. Al Hassan Kheiry, Arwa
Elrabie, Imani-Leyla Raye.
The Observatory firmly
condemns the above-mentioned judicial harassment, which is the latest evidence
of an increasing pattern of judicial harassment launched by the authorities
targeting civil society organisations and human rights defenders in Sudan.
Finally,
until all charges are dropped against them, the Observatory urges the Sudanese
authorities to ensure that their conditions of detention are humane and that
all judicial proceedings against the six are carried out in full compliance
with his right to a fair trial, as protected under international law.
The
Observatory expresses concerns regarding Mr. Khalafalla Al-Afif Mukhtar as his
health condition is deteriorating, he suffers from heart condition and he does
not have access to the appropriate medical care. 
Background information:
On March 26, 2015,
approximately ten plain-clothed National Intelligence and Security Services (NISS) agents raided TRACKs’
premises, during the last day of a training on “social responsibility and
active citizenship”. No search warrant was presented and computers and
documents belonging to TRACKs were confiscated.
On April 16, 2015,
Mr. Adil Bakheit, member of the Board of Trustees of the Sudan
Human Rights Monitor (SHRM)[4] was arrested and charged with
“joint acts in the execution of criminal conspiracy, criminal conspiracy,
undermining the constitutional system, waging war against the State, calling
for opposition to public authority by use of violent or criminal force, publication
of false news, and impersonating a public servant”. The offences of waging war
against the state and undermining the constitutional system carry the death
penalty. 
In May 2015, Mr. Khalafalla
Al-Afif Mukhtar was charged with a number of crimes, including “criminal
conspiracy”, “undermining the constitutional system” and “waging war against
the State” and later released on bail.
On
June 3, 2015, Mr. Adil Bakheit was released on bail. 
In
February 2016, the State Crimes Prosecution Office dropped the criminal case.
On
February 29, 2016, NISS officers raided for the second time TRACKs offices
without any warrant and brought the staff present in the premises to the police
station in order to interrogate them for 12 hours on TRACKs’ activities,
including on their relation to KACE. Moreover, the NISS officers severely
threatened, verbally abused and ill-treated them for hours.
On
May 22, 2016, Messrs. Khalafalla Al-Afif Mukhtar, Mustafa Adam and Midhat A Hamdan, Al Hassan Kheiry,
Ms. Arwa Elrabie and Ms. Imani-Leyla Raye and three other TRACKs staff Ms.
Nudaina Kamal, accountant, Mr. Khuzaini El Hadi and Mr. Al Shazali Ibrahim Al
Sheikh were summoned to the NISS Department in Khartoum. Only two of them were
questioned and further threatened in relation to their personal activities,
including their activism and sources of income, while others were kept waiting
before all the individuals summoned were placed in custody pending further
investigations. 
Ms.
Nudaina Kamal was released shortly after her arrest on the same day. Ms. Arwa
Elrabie and Ms. Imany-Leyla Raye were released on bail on May 30; Messrs.
Hassan Kheiry, Khuzaini El Hadi and Al Shazali Ibrahim Al Sheikh on June 7,
2016. 
On
August 15, 2016, Messrs. Khalafalla Al-Afif Mukhtar, Mustafa Adam and Midhat A
Hamdan were transferred to Al Huda prison after spending almost three months in
a narrow cell with poor ventilation and access to food[5],
no access to medication and limited access to toilet at the State Prosecution
office and were charged for the same offences. 
Furthermore,
Mr. Khalafalla Al-Afif Mukhtar, Ms. Arwa Elrabie, Ms. Nudaina Kamal and Mr.
Adil Bakheitare also facing the similar charges in another court case
related to another raid conducted at TRACKs’ offices on March 26, 2015. The
case was dropped on February 2016 by the State Crimes Prosecution Office, and
re-opened by the same on August 15, 2016. Their first hearing should have taken
place on August 24, 2016 but has already been postponed three times and no date
for the next hearing has been set yet.
Actions requested:
