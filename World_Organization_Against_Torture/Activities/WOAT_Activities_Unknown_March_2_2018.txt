The Observatory for the
Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a partnership of FIDH and the World
Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), has received new information and requests
your urgent intervention in the following situation in South Korea.
 
New information:
 
The Observatory has been
informed by reliable sources about the arrest, arbitrary detention, and judicial
harassment of former Secretary General of the Korean Confederation of Trade
Unions[1] (KCTU) Ms. Lee
Young-joo.
 
According to the
information received, on January 23, 2018, Ms. Lee was charged by the Public Prosecutor
with “obstruction of general traffic”, “special destruction of public goods”,
and violation of Articles 11 and 16 of the Act on Demonstration and Assembly,
in connection with her participation in a demonstration organized by KCTU
against proposed labour reforms in Seoul on November 14, 2015 (see background
information). 
 
Ms. Lee will appear
before Seoul Central District Court on March 14, 2018, for the first hearing in
her case.
 
The Observatory recalls
that Ms. Lee had lived in self-imposed house arrest at the KCTU headquarters in
Seoul since December 2015 in order to avoid being arrested by police in
connection with her participation in the November 14, 2015 demonstration. The
police had issued an arrest warrant against her with unlimited validity after
that protest.
 
On December 18, 2017, Ms.
Lee left KCTU’s headquarters and moved to the head office of the ruling
Democratic Party in Yeouido, Seoul, to start a hunger strike.
 
On December 27, 2017, she
ended her hunger strike because of her deteriorating health. At 7:00 pm on that
day, KCTU staged a rally in front of the Democratic Party’s head office to
welcome her back. About 150 police were deployed in order to execute the arrest
warrant against Ms. Lee. 
 
As Ms. Lee required
urgent medical treatment, an ambulance was called and, as soon as she left the
building carried on a stretcher by paramedics, a police officer read out the
arrest warrant in front of her and arrested her. Ms. Lee was transported to the
Green Hospital in Jung Rang District in Seoul, where police officers were
stationed outside her room.
 
On December 30, 2017, the
Seoul Central District Court issued a detention warrant against her. The next
day, Ms. Lee was transferred to the Seoul Detention Centre, where she remains
to date.
 
The Observatory strongly
condemns the arbitrary detention of Ms. Lee Young-joo, which seem to be aimed
at deterring her peaceful human rights activities, and calls for her immediate
and unconditional release.
 
The Observatory recalls
that Mr. Han Sang-gyun, KCTU
President, is still serving a three-year prison sentence in connection with the
November 14, 2015 demonstration. In an opinion issued on April 25, 2017, the
United Nations (UN) Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (WGAD) declared Mr. Han’s
deprivation of liberty arbitrary because it resulted from the exercise of his
right to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly.
 
Background information: 
 
On November 14, 2015,
ahead of the demonstrations organised by KCTU against proposed labour law
reforms in Seoul, the police took pre-emptive measures against the peaceful
demonstration and mobilised about 20,000 officers from 248 squadrons, 19 water
cannons, 679 buses, and 580 capsicum spray devices. Altercations between the
police and demonstrators ensued. The police fired water cannons and tear gas directly
at peaceful marchers. Dozens of civilians and police officers were injured. The
police launched an investigation into the incident, as a result of which over
1,500 civilians were investigated and 538 KCTU members were summoned as
suspects. Eventually, 20 KCTU members and officials were indicted and 9 of them
were sentenced to jail terms.
 
Actions requested:
 
The Observatory urges the
authorities of South Korea to:
 
i. Guarantee the physical
and psychological integrity of Ms. Lee Young-joo, Mr. Han Sang-gyun, and all
KCTU members and officers, as well as all peaceful protesters and human rights
defenders in South Korea;
 
ii. Immediately and
unconditionally release Ms. Lee Young-joo and Mr. Han Sang-gyun, as
their detention is arbitrary since it only aims at sanctioning their
legitimate human rights activities;
 
iii. Put an end to all
acts of harassment, including at the judicial level, against all trade
unionists as well as all human rights defenders in South Korea;
 
iv. Ensure in all
circumstances that all human rights defenders in South Korea are able to carry
out their legitimate activities, including the organisation of peaceful
assemblies without any hindrance or fear of reprisals;
 
v. Conform with the
provisions of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted on December 9,
1998 by the United Nations General Assembly, in particular its Articles 1, 5(a)
and 12;
 
vi. Ensure in all
circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance
with international human rights standards and international instruments
ratified by South Korea.
