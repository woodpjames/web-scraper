Despite the unequivocal obligation of States to ensure the protection of children under its custody, children often have no voice or means to report abuses committed against them and when they succeed in reporting, there is little accountability and reprisals are commonplace. OMCT believes that civil society monitoring of places of deprivation of liberty together with independent bodies with a special focus on children’s rights can prevent practices of torture and foster State accountability.OMCT also wishes to welcome Mr. Mendez support for the Global Study on Children Deprived of Liberty with the appointment of an independent expert, which is an important step in giving more visibility to this problematic.Mr. Special Rapporteur, turning to your report on Mexico,  It reflects our findings and identifies systemic shortcomings in the legal and institutional framework, as well as deep-rooted disruptive practices. OMCT sees as a positive signal the increase of court decisions excluding evidence obtained under torture; however, defective investigations remain a stumbling barrier to the eradication of a pervasive culture of impunity. Thus, we urge the Mexican authorities to take decisive steps to implement the SRT’s recommendations, starting with a thorough application of the Istanbul Protocol by independent and adequately trained medical personnel.Mr. Special Rapporteur, OMCT full-heartedly endorses your recommendations on Tunisia, notably regarding the need to reverse impunity.We call upon the Government of Tunisia to promptly reform national legislation in order to improve procedural safeguards governing the arrest, interrogation and pre-charge detention; and to make increasing use of non-custodial measures of punishment for offenses such as drug charges. This would also help managing the difficult conditions of detention that in themselves amount to inhuman treatment.We thank you.
