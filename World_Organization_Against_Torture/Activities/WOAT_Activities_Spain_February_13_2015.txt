Re: Spain’s
Basic Law for the Protection of Public Security, a threat to the rights of
assembly and asylum
 
Dear Members of the European Parliament,
 
The undersigned organisations are writing to you to express their grave
concern over the adoption of the Basic
Law for the Protection of Public Security (Ley Orgánica para la Protección
de la Seguridad Ciudadana) by the plenary of the Congress of Deputies on 11
December 2014. This law, currently awaiting final approval in the Senate prior
to its final review by the Congress of Deputies, would introduce unnecessary
and disproportionate restrictions on the right to peaceful assembly in Spain
and would legalise the practice of summary returns to Morocco from Spain’s
enclaves in North Africa. 
 
The bill, also called the “gag law,” was adopted despite vigorous
rejection by all the opposition parties and civil society organisations, which
denounced the direct threat that the law poses to the right to peaceful
assembly, and despite the opposition of 82% of the Spanish public opinion,
according to recent polls. It is part of a series of other restrictive
measures, such as the reform of the Penal Code and the Free Legal Assistance
Act, aiming at limiting the exercise of the right to peaceful assembly in Spain. 
 
The Basic Law for the Protection of Public Security introduces new
offences and administrative sanctions, some of which are very severe, targeting
actions related to social protests. For example, fines of up to €600 can be
imposed on individuals for organising public meetings and demonstrations
without prior notification (Article 37.1), making spontaneous gatherings
impossible regardless of their peaceful nature. Peaceful assemblies in the vicinity
of the Congress, the Senate or the legislative assemblies of the Autonomous
Regions will be considered as a “serious offence” punishable by a fine of up to
€30,000 should they seriously disturb public order (Article 36.2).
International human rights law allows for limitations to the right to peaceful
assembly to ensure public order but any such restrictions must meet a strict
test of necessity and proportionality. Meetings or demonstrations not
previously declared in facilities where basic community services are provided,
including nuclear power plants, transport infrastructures such as airports,
train stations and ports, and telecommunications infrastructures could be fined
up to €600,000 (Article 35.1). 
 
Spain’s new public security law also provides for fines of up to €30,000
for disseminating photographs of police officers and state security bodies that
are deemed to endanger them or the success of their operations (Article 36.26).
This could hinder the documentation and reporting of abuses committed by law
enforcement personnel and reinforce the climate of impunity. Disobeying and
resisting authorities, as well as refusing to disband meetings and
demonstrations may also be fined up to €30,000 (Articles 36.6 and 36.7).
Showing disrespect for police officers could be fined up to €600 (Article 37.4).
 
This new law comes in response to the growing wave of protests demanding
direct citizen participation in public affairs and involvement in decisions
taken in response to the economic and financial crisis that has gripped the
country since 2008. Under the pretext of improving public safety, the law aims
at dissuading citizens from expressing publicly their concerns and muzzling
criticism by criminalising new forms of collective action and expression that
have developed in recent years, including 'escraches' (“demonstrations
aiming at public denunciations”), sit-ins, “occupying” public spaces, peaceful
“surroundings” of parliaments and “concerts of pots and pans.” 
 
Our organisations are also deeply concerned about an amendment to the
new law presented at the last minute by the government that
would modify Organic Law 4/2000 on the rights and freedoms of foreigners in
Spain and their integration (Additional Disposition 10). This amendment would
legalise the practice of summary returns
resorted to in Ceuta and Melilla, whereby migrants who manage to cross the
Spanish-Moroccan border will be immediately sent back. This new provision
significantly restricts the right to seek asylum and violates the principle of non-refoulement and the prohibition of
collective expulsions. It exposes migrants to serious risk of torture and
ill-treatment as it would de facto deny them the possibility of filing a
complaint in case of abuses perpetrated by law enforcement personnel.
 
In view of
the above, several announced provisions of the Basic Law for the Protection of
Public Security would not be compatible with Articles 13 and 21 of the Spanish Constitution,
European Union law, including the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, and
international human rights law. This includes the Convention
relating to the Status of Refugees of 1951, the International Covenant on Civil
and Political Rights, Articles 12.1, 18 and 19 of the Charter of Fundamental
Rights of the European Union, Article 3 and 11 of the European Convention on
Human Rights and Article 4 of its Protocol No 4. 
 
Several actors of the international community have already expressed
concerns about Spain’s new public security law and the impact it could have on
the rights to peaceful assembly and asylum. In his last report to the 26th
regular session of the UN Human Rights Council in June 2014, the UN Special Rapporteur
on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and association,
Mr Maina Kiai, considered that both the Basic Law for the Protection of
Public Security and the reform of the Penal Code “point to a violation of the
very essence of the right to demonstrate by criminalizing a wide range of
behaviours inherent to the exercise of this fundamental right, causing a major
limitation of the exercise thereof.”[1]
The Council of Europe’s Commissioner for Human Rights, Mr Nils Muiznieks, has
also emphasized the threat that the law poses for the exercise of the right to
peaceful assembly and has called for removal of the prior authorisation
requirement, the classification of demonstrations around Congress or the
regional assemblies as serious offences and the prohibition of recording images
of law enforcement personnel in the exercise of their duties from the final
version. In an article published on Human Rights Day, the Commissioner also
noted that the proposal to legalise automatic and collective expulsions of migrants
was “unjust and illegal” under international law.[2]
 
During Spain’s second Universal Periodic Review that took place in
January 2015, several States including EU Member States called on the Spanish
government to ensure the full enjoyment of the right to peaceful assembly and
access to effective asylum procedures and refrain from adopting any laws that
would limit the exercise of these rights. On
24 October 2014, the then-Commissioner for Home Affairs Cecilia Malmström
addressed a letter to Spain’s Interior Minister Jorge Fernández Díaz,
expressing concern over this proposed amendment to legalise summary expulsions
as well as the use of excessive force at the enclave borders.[3]
 
In line with these previous initiatives, we urge you to discuss this
law, including in the context of the forthcoming European Parliament report on
the situation of fundamental rights in the European Union (2013-2014), and to
call on the European Commission and Council to take immediate action and do all
what is in their powers to prevent the adoption of a law that would breach
international and European standards concerning the rights to assembly and
asylum.
 
Thank you for your consideration.
