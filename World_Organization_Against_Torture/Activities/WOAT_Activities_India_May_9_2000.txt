Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by a reliable source of the torture, including sexual violence, and illegal detention of 12 women and 2 minors (see case IND 100500.CC), in Chennai, Tamil Nadu State in the South of India.   According to the information received, the 12 women have been subjected to illegal detention and torture in connection with detention of Nathan, s/o Nagappan of Chennai. He was arrested on 10 February 2000 in connection with a robbery, taken to the F-1 police station where he was severely tortured and where he died on 17 February.   According to the information received, on 11 February 2000, Sala, Nathan's wife was taken into custody and tortured by bending her fingers backwards over a pen and forcing her to bend over a stool and beating her. On 12 February 2000 Renuka, Bhavani, Umayavalli, Chelli, Amutha were also all detained and tortured.  Their hair was grabbed, they were beaten on the back and buttocks, verbally abused and sexually molested.  Furthermore, according to information received, on 13th February 2000, Nagarani, Palayam, Kannagi and Veerammal (mother of Nathan), Velankanni and Nagarani's daughter Indira, 24, were all beaten, verbally abused, molested, and their hands injured.  It is reported that the women were detained illegally at F-1 station during day, where tortured, then most were detained at the All-Women's Police Station at night from 11pm under different, false names entered in prison records. This is clearly an offence of wrongful confinement and violates section 160 of the Criminal Procedure Code.  None were brought before a court, even though they were detained for much longer than the maximum 24 hours allowed before they must be brought to court by the police.   Many of the women named a particular policeman Venkatesh who was the most brutal and abusive, allegedly encouraging the other police to help him torture the detainees.  The women also claimed that the police were in a drunken state for much of the time of their detention.  Action requested  Please write to the authorities in India urging them to:  i.	take all necessary measures to guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of these women;  ii.	guarantee an immediate investigation into the these events, allegations of torture and illegal detention, identify those responsible, bring them before a civil competent and impartial tribunal and apply the penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions provided by law;  iii.	guarantee adequate compensation and rehabilitation for the above-mentioned women;  iv.	guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
