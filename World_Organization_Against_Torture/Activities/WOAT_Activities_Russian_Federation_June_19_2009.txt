Brief description of the situation The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Russian-Chechen Friendship Society (RCFS), a member of OMCT SOS-Torture Network, about the severe beatings of Mr. Pavel Nagibin (born on 6 June 1971), a member of the National Bolshevik Party (NBP) and The Other Russia coalition, in Rostov-on-Don, by police. According to the information received, on 12 June 2009, Mr. Pavel Nagibin was heading to the rally “Russia against Putin”, that took place in the square in front of the Sport Palace, when he was assaulted by several police officers on Filimonovskaja Street. He reportedly tried to run away but they allegedly knocked him down and started beating him. He was then handcuffed and taken to Leninsky district police station where he was again beaten. Due to the injuries sustained (including severe cut wound on his hip, internal and external bleeding and haematomas on both eyes), he was later brought to the hospital. He reportedly still needs medical attention. On 15 June 2009, Mr. Pavel Nagibin reportedly lodged a complaint of physical assault and detention with the prosecutor’s office but the investigation has not yet been launched. Furthermore, police officers are reportedly stating that they had found Mr. Pavel Nagibin fighting in the street and that they had to arrest him. According to the same information, Mr. Pavel Nagibin had been summoned to the prosecutor’s office of Rostov-on-Don on 11 June 2009, one day before the rally was to take place. While the authorities agreed to the rally, they later allegedly threatened all the protesters with detention if they would show at the planned location. Mr. Pavel Nagibin had already been harassed and detained in 2007 and 2008 because of his involvement in The Other Russia coalition and the March of Dissent that had been organised in 2007. Furthermore, according to the same information received, two other participants in the rally were also harassed on 12 June 2009. Mr. Alexander Nosenkov, an activist, was arrested by the police before the rally started and taken to the police station where he was allegedly threatened with “being finished off” if he would not stop his political activities and later beaten with a heavy book on his head. Mr. Boris Batyy, co-organiser of the 12 June rally and chair of the United Civic Front, was ordered on the same day not to leave the city as an alleged suspect in a criminal case on counterfeit software, a case which had been opened in June 2007 in the context of the 2007 March of dissent. The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned for the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Pavel Nagibin, Mr. Alexander Nosenkov and Mr. Boris Batty, following these events. OMCT calls on the competent authorities to carry out a prompt, effective, thorough, independent and impartial investigation into the allegations of ill-treatment and threats, the results of which must be made public, in order to bring those responsible before a competent, independent and impartial tribunal and apply penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions as provided by law.
