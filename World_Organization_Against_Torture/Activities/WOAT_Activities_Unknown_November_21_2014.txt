 PRESS RELEASE 
 'The OMCT celebrates the 25th Anniversary of the
Convention on the Rights of the Child' 

New York, 20 November 2014 
Today the World celebrates
the 25th anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The most widely
ratified human rights treaty in the World is a milestone for the empowerment of
children and promotion of their rights.In the past weeks the OMCT has promoted and participate in a series of
activities in order to advocate for the rights of children and their protection
from torture and ill-treatment, culminating with the participation today at the
High Level Panel on the Rights of the Child at the General Assembly in New
York."To celebrate the
recognition of children's basic human rights also means recognizing their
special vulnerability to all forms of harm, including torture and
ill-treatment. In this landmark occasion we should not forget that children'
special needs entail an increased duty of diligence and responsibility of
States." Said the OMCT Secretary General, Gerald
Staberock.
The OMCT's child rights coordinator has met with the UN Special Rapporteur
on Torture, Juan Mendez, and the UN Special Rapporteur on Violence Against
Children, Marta Santos Pais, to discuss the advancements and challenges faced
by children and their advocates in promoting their rights and ensuring their
protection from torture and ill-treatment.
Despite the many reasons to celebrate, today the OMCT would like to
remember the thousands of children deprived of liberty who are still subject to
inhumane conditions of detention and frequently submitted to practices of
torture and ill-treatment around the globe. 
"We still see in our
daily work monitoring juvenile detention centres around the World that children
are not seen as subject of rights and practices of torture, ill-treatment and
corporal punishment, that in some cases wouldn't be allowed or accepted towards
adults, are often tolerated by States and societies when applicable to
children."  Noted the
OMCT's child rights coordinator, Carolina Barbara.
On the anniversary of CRC, the OMCT would like to call members states to
step up to the commitments and promises made 25 years ago to protect children
from torture and ill-treatment and ensure accountability for the crimes
committed against them.
