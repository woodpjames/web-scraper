A coalition of civil society
organizations and academic institutions[1]
submitted an alternative report to the Committee Against Torture in view of the
consideration of Venezuela’s third and fourth periodic report concerning the
implementation of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or
Degrading Treatment or Punishment (the Convention), that will take place at the
53rd period of sessions, in October 2014. This document is the
executive summary of the mentioned report which is available in Spanish and in
English[2].
Despite significant
progresses such as the approval of the Special Law to Prevent and Punish
Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment (Law against Torture)
and amendments to the Organic Law on the Right of Women to a Life Free from
Violence, the
organisations who are the authors of this report express concern about the fact
that torture continues to be committed by security forces and perpetuated due
to a lack of action on the side of the national authorities.  
At the international
level, Venezuela is yet to ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention
against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
(OPCAT), which was signed by this country in July 2011 during the Universal
Periodi Review in the Human Rights Council. Venezuela has not yet accepted the
visit requests extended by several UN human rights mechanisms such as the UN
Special Rapporteur on Torture and the UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of
Assembly and of
Association. 
At
the national level, protesters continue to be strongly repressed through
excessive use of police force, threats, acts of harassment, arbitrary
detentions and other forms of ill-treatment. An increase of the repression
during the first semester of 2013 up to the present has been perceived by the
authors of the report.
