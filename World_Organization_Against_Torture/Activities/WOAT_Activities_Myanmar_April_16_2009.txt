According to the information received, on April 10, 2009, Mr. U Zaw Myint Aung, Mr. U Soe Oo, Mr. Maung Tun Nyein, Ms. Khine Lin Myat and Ms. Shwe Yi Nyunt, also a member of FTUB Women’s Committee, returned safely to their homes in Rangoon, albeit after having been warned to cease any activity with the FTUB. The Observatory welcomes the release of Mr. U Zaw Myint Aung, Mr. U Soe Oo, Mr. Maung Tun Nyein, Ms. Khine Lin Myat and Ms. Shwe Yi Nyunt, and wishes to thank all the persons, organisations, and institutions that intervened on their behalf.

Furthermore, an unspecified number of family members of the five workers’ rights defenders in question were also arrested, threatened and intimidated in an effort by the authorities to compel cooperation from the five FTUB members.
