Brief description of the situationThe International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Sudan Organisation Against Torture (SOAT), a member of OMCT network, about the continuing torture, arbitrary arrests and harassment of the civilian population in Darfur by government security organs despite the signing of the Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA).    According to the information received, on 11 June 2006, five police officers from the Central Reserve Police arrested Mr. Sideeg Musa Saed (20 yrs), a student, and Mr. Ismail Musa Abdel Gadeem (26 yrs), a teacher, from Alsouque Alshabi central market in Nyala on suspicion of supporting the Sudan Liberation Army/Movement (SLA), a faction of which is signatory to the DPA. The men who belong to the Zaghawa tribe were taken to the offices of the reserve police in Nyala where they were reportedly subjected to torture. The men were beaten with the butt of the officers’ guns on their heads and backs and flogged all over their body. Mr. Saead sustained serious injuries to his eye. On the same day, Mr. Sideeg Musa Saed and Mr. Ismail Musa Abdel Gadeem were transferred to Nyala Wasat Police station where they were officially charged with articles 50 (Undermining the Constitutional System) and 51 (Waging war against the State) of the 1991 Penal code. SOAT Lawyers Network in Nyala is providing legal aid to the two men.   Moreover, on 11 June 2006 at approximately 08.00 am, armed militias, reportedly the Janjaweed militias, allegedly attacked Mr. Musa Ahmed Abdel Nour (50 yrs), from the Dago tribe and resident at Dereig IDP camp whilst he was escorting two elderly women to collect firewood outside the camp. During the attack the militias threatened Mr. Abdel Nour with a gun before kidnapping him and taking his horse and forcing the two women to walk back to the camp. Mr. Abdel Nour was released on the same day at 14.00 pm. Following his release, Mr. Abdel Nour left Dereig camp and is now staying at Kalma camp.   Furthermore it is reported that on 6 June 2006, three armed militias, reportedly the Janjaweed militias, attacked Mr. Abdullah Ahmed Adam (50 yrs), Dago tribe, from Kalma IDP camp. Mr. Adam was attacked 2 km north of the camp; he was threatened by the militias after which they took his horse.   The International Secretariat of OMCT urges the Sudanese authorities to immediately implement its obligations as agreed in the DPA. The International Secretariat of OMCT together with SOAT expresses its grave concern over the continued targeting of the civilian population by the Janjaweed militias and the arrests and detention on suspicion of supporting the SLA.  It should be recalled that article 27(315) of the DPA requires the Government of Sudan to “restrict all Janjaweed/armed militia and PDF to their headquarters, garrisons, cantonment sites or communities and take other steps to contain, reduce and ultimately eliminate the threat posed by such forces”. Furthermore, article 27 (317) states that “Government of Sudan, with support from AMIS, shall take all other steps required to completely eliminate the threat posed by Janjaweed/armed militia to the civilian population....”.
