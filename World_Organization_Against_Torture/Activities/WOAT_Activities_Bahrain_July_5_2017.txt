The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a partnership of FIDH
and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent
intervention in the following situation in Bahrain.
 
Description
of the situation:
 
The Observatory has
been informed by reliable sources about the arbitrary arrest and detention of
Mrs. Ebtisam Al-Saegh, Monitoring
and Documentation Officer at the NGO Salam for Democracy and Human Rights.
 
According to the
information received, on July 4, 2017, at approximatively 12:45am, armed,
masked and plain clothed officers from the Bahrain security forces raided Mrs.
Ebtisam Al-Saegh’s home and arrested her without any warrant. It is feared that
the security forces officers might belong to the National Security Agency
(NSA).
 
Following her arrest,
Mrs. Ebtisam Al-Saegh was briefly seen by detainees in the morning of July 4,
2017, at the Isa Town women’s prison visibly in poor physical conditions before
being taken away to an undisclosed location. Detainees who could see Mrs.
Ebtisam Al-Saegh reported that she may have been beaten.
 
Although her
whereabouts were not immediately disclosed to her family, on July 4, 2017, at
around 9pm, Mrs. Ebtisam Al-Saegh called her family from Isa Town women’s
prison, where she is being detained in solitary confinement outside of
interrogation hours. She reported being interrogated for long hours under though
circumstances and being forced to sign on false confessions. She also reported
being sent to the Ministry of Interior’s clinic in Al Qaalaa, were she was
diagnosed with low blood pressure.
 
As of publication of
this Urgent Appeal, Mrs. Ebtisam Al-Saegh had no access to her family or a
lawyer. Moreover, no information could be obtained as per potential charges
against her. 
 
The Observatory recalls
that in May 2017, Mrs. Ebtisam Al-Saegh was previously held, tortured and
sexually assaulted by the NSA at Muharraq police station, where she was being
detained in connection with her human rights activities[1].
 
Mrs. Ebtisam Al-Saegh,
who together with 22 other human rights defenders in April 2017, was subjected
to a travel ban and falsely accused of participating in “illegal gatherings” in
the city of Duraz[2], is also
the target of a defamation campaign conducted by the pro-government newspaper Al-Ayam, which accused her of
fabricating reports on human rights violations in Bahrain. On May 15, 2017,
Mrs. Al-Saegh’s car was burnt.
 
The
Observatory expresses its outmost concerns over the arbitrary detention in
solitary confinement of Mrs. Ebtisam Al-Saegh and fears that she might be at
risk of torture while in detention. The Observatory urges Bahraini authorities
to guarantee her physical and psychological integrity, to allow her to access
her family and lawyer and to immediately and unconditionally release her.

provided by the law to them;
