the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, has joined a letter
 by over 150 other civil
society organizations addressed to all Member States of the UN General Assembly urging them to reject amendments intended to
weaken the resolution on the protection of human rights defenders. The resolution is set to be
adopted on Wednesday the 25th of November 2015 in the UN General Assembly’s Third
Committee.
 To: All
Member States of the United Nations General Assembly 
 24 November 2015 
 Excellencies, 
We write to
you as a group of human rights defenders and civil society organizations
located across the world working at national, regional and international
levels. We write in regard to the draft resolution entitled ”Recognizing
the role of human rights defenders and the need for their protection“ currently being advanced in the UN General Assembly’s Third Committee,
and due to be adopted on Wednesday 25 November 2015. 
We urge your
government to support the abovementioned resolution and to reject amendments,
tabled by the African Group, China and Iran, designed to weaken the text.[1] 
Among other
things, the proposed amendments remove references to the legitimacy of the work
of human rights defenders, delete or weaken language regarding the need for
their protection, and delete whole paragraphs related to the need to combat
impunity for violations and abuses against defenders and the need to ensure
adequate procedural safeguards in judicial proceedings. A call for the release
of defenders detained or imprisoned in violation of international human rights
law, for exercising their human rights and fundamental freedoms, is also proposed
for deletion. In addition, the amendments introduce notions that States should
only support and enable their work 'as appropriate', rather than in accordance
with the UN
Declaration on Human Rights Defenders and other obligations arising under international human rights law. 
Human rights
defenders make a vital contribution to the promotion and respect for human
rights, democratic processes, securing and maintaining peace and security, and
advancing development in our countries. However, in doing this work, defenders
often face a range of violations and abuses at the hands of State and non-State
actors. States must acknowledge the role of defenders and the specific risks
they face, and commit to ensuring their protection. 
Fifteen years
ago, all States agreed to the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders,
including State obligations to protect all human rights defenders working on
all human rights. This commitment has been reiterated and built upon in
subsequent General Assembly and Human Rights Council resolutions. We are
therefore extremely concerned to hear that the abovementioned delegations have
objected to several core elements of the draft resolution. 
Based on
consultations with over 500 defenders from 111 States, the Special Rapporteur
on Human Rights Defenders found that in the vast majority of States the
situation for human rights defenders is deteriorating in law and in practice.
He concluded that a lack of awareness regarding their vital and legitimate
work, combined with a lack of political commitment and weak institutional
arrangements for their protection, is placing them, their organisations and
families at elevated risk.[2] 
The resolution
as drafted reflects a number of these findings and makes a series of
recommendations for States and other actors. Importantly, this year’s text
includes a key focus on the implementation of the resolution itself. This will
hopefully prompt States and other actors to move beyond rhetoric in addressing
the challenges faced by human rights defenders and take action to ensure the
implementation of the calls in the resolution. 
We urge all States to live up to their human rights commitments by
supporting this resolution, by rejecting amendments designed to weaken it, and
by taking concrete steps to protect human rights defenders.
