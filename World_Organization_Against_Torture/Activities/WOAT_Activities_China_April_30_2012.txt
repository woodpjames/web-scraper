URGENT APPEAL - THE 
OBSERVATORY

Ongoing harassment
People’s Republic of China
April 30, 2012
 
The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint 
programme of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and the International 
Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), has received new information and requests 
your urgent intervention on the following situation in the People’s Republic of China.
 
New information:
 
The Observatory has been informed by Human Rights in China (HRIC) and 
Chinese Human Rights Defenders (CHRD) that Mr. Chen Guangcheng, a prominent self-taught human lawyer involved in denouncing the extensive use of violence by the 
authorities of Linyi city, Shangdong province, in relation to birth planning 
policies, has managed to escape the house arrest he has been subjected to 
since September 2010[1] and is safe. However, several of his relatives, including his older brother, Mr. 
Chen Guangfu, his nephew, Mr. Chen Kegui, his cousin, Mr. Chen Guangcun, and Mr. Chen Guangcun’s son, Mr. Chen Hua, were 
subsequently reportedly arrested.
 
According to the information received, on April 27, 2012, 
a video of Mr. Chen Guangcheng was released by an overseas Chinese 
language news website, Boxun.com, and later posted on YouTube[2]. In the video, Mr. Chen asked Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao to bring to 
justice those who committed crimes against him and his family and the corrupt 
officials who have profited from maintaining his surveillance and house arrest 
over the years. Mr. Chen also asked for the protection of his family 
members.
 
In the video, Mr. Chen detailed many beatings that he, his wife and 
his mother suffered at the hands of dozens of police officers and Party 
officials acting on orders from the Linyi city and Shuanghou township 
authorities. He described the deployment of as many as several hundred people in 
layers of cordons that enforced his 18-month house arrest: policemen were 
stationed inside and outside his home, at the four corners of the road leading 
to his home, and sometimes in the neighbouring village, and vehicles patrolled 
an area in a five-kilometre radius around his village. Mr. Chen also described 
officials bragging about the money they were making from the employment of the 
large contingent of men who maintained his and his wife’s confinement. He also 
said that he was fearing retaliation that would target his wife, mother, and 
children.
 
As of issuing this Urgent Appeal, the situation of Mr. Chen’s family, which includes his ailing mother, 
his wife Yuan Weijing and their young daughter, and who had been under illegal 
house arrest with him, remains unknown.
 
Moreover, on April 27, 2012, Mr. Chen Kegui was taken away by more than 30 policemen from his home, 
after he had a violent confrontation with intruders entering his house from the 
township government. When five lawyers arrived in Dongshigu village, Shuanghou 
township, Yi’nan county, Linyi city, and asked about Mr. Chen Kegui, public 
security authorities denied having taken him away, saying that he had fled, and 
that an order for his arrest had been issued. The day before, his father, 
Mr. Chen Guangfu, had also been taken away in the late evening by 
unknown persons[3]. At least two other relatives of Mr. Chen Guangcheng, his cousin Mr. 
Chen Guangcun and his son Mr. Chen Hua, were also taken into 
custody.
 
Moreover, Ms. He Peirong would reportedly be currently missing and 
her whereabouts unknown, after she Tweeted her own involvement in assisting 
Mr. Chen Guangcheng’s escape.
 
Background information[4]:
 
On March 11, 2006, Mr. Chen Guangcheng was arrested with other 
militants by local police officers for “disturbing traffic”. Before he was 
arrested, Mr. Chen had been campaigning against the Linyi city authorities’ 
recurrent use of violence for the implementation of the Government birth 
quotas.
 
On August 24, 2006, Mr. Guangcheng was sentenced to four years’ and 
three months’ imprisonment for “intentionally disrupting traffic” and “inciting material 
destruction”. While in prison, he was denied appropriate medical care. 

 
On September 9, 2010, Mr. Guangcheng was finally released from prison 
after having served over four years of imprisonment for his work exposing human 
rights abuses in Linyi city . However, despite 
having served his full sentence, he and his family were subjected to 
extrajudicial house arrest under very harsh conditions. On February 8, 2011, Mr. 
Guangcheng and his wife, Mrs. Yuan Weijing, were beaten by national security 
officers from Linyi city and police from Shuanghou town at their home and were 
subsequently prevented from seeking medical treatment. The beating was 
reportedly related to the release of a videotape detailing the illegal house 
arrest and the abuses he and his family suffered during this 
period.
 
Actions requested:
 
Please write to the authorities in the People’s Republic of China, 
urging them to:
 
i.

Guangcheng and his relatives, including Messrs. Chen Guangfu, Chen Kegui, 
Chen Guangcun and Chen Hua as well as of Ms. He Peirong and of all human rights defenders in China;
 
ii.                   
Ensure the immediate release of Messrs. Chen Guangfu, Chen Kegui, Chen Guangcun and Chen Hua as well as of Ms. He Peirong, since their detention seem to only aim at sanctioning Mr. Chen Guangcheng’s human rights activities;
 
iii.                  
Order an immediate, thorough, effective and impartial investigation 
into the above mentioned acts, the result of which must be made public, in order 
to identify all those responsible, bring them before a civil competent and 
impartial tribunal and apply to them the penal sanctions provided by the 
law;
 
iv.                 
Put an end to the harassment - including at the judicial level - 
against Mr. Chen Guangcheng, his relatives, as well as against all human rights 
defenders in the People’s Republic of China;
 
v.                   
Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights 
Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 
1998, especially its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, 
individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the 
protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the 
national and international levels”, and Article 12.2, which provides that “the 
State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the 
competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, 
against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse 
discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his 
or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present 
Declaration”;
