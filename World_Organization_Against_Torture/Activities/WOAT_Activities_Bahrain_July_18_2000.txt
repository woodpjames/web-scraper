Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT has received information from the Bahrain Human Rights Organisation, (BHRO), a member of the network, regarding the arrest and arbitrary detention of two children in June and July 2000.  According to the information received, at the beginning of July 2000, security forces attacked several houses in Bilad al-Qadim and arrested a number of citizens, releasing them a couple of days later.  Alsayed Jabir Alsayed Ibrahim, 17 years old, was among those arrested.  Also, its is reported that on 21st June, a child, Mosa Jaafer Al-Shaikh from Daih was arrested and kept in jail for four days, allegedly tortured severely and then released.  Also in June 2000, a number of young people were sentenced, following their arrest as children three to four years ago.  The following persons were sentenced:  Tahir Abbas Hussain Mahffodh, 18 years old (sentenced to 7 years imprisonment), Ali Alshaikh Mosa Hassan Al-Oraibi, 18 (7 years) for allegedly intentionally setting fire to a building in Tubil on 19 January 1997.
