Eliminating torture in Mexico:
moving from intention to realisation?

14h00 – 15h30
Room XXII,

The
Federal Government of Mexico has repeatedly asserted its intention to work
towards the elimination of torture and ill-treatment. Yet, the Special Rapporteur
on torture notes in his report on his visit to Mexico in 2014 that “[t]orture
is generalized in Mexico”. This event will seek to identify measures and best
practices that the Government of Mexico could adopt to prevent and eliminate
torture and ensure effective redress to victims of torture. The event is also intended to offer to representatives
of the international community practical suggestions for assisting Mexico in
the elimination of torture and ill-treatment.
Speakers:
Mr Juan E. Méndez, Special Rapporteur on torture and other
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment 
Representative of the Permanent Mission of Mexico, To Be
