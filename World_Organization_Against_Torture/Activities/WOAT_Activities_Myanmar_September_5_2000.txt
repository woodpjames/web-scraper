Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned for the physical and psychological integrity of Aung San Suu Kyi, Secretary General, and all other members of the National League for Democracy (NLD), who have not been seen in public since Saturday 2nd September.  In particular, OMCT is gravely concerned for 16 members of NLD Youth members and two leaders who have reportedly been imprisoned.  According to the information received, on 2 September 2000 when around midnight, nearly 200 riot police raided the NLD roadside convoy, led by Aung San Suu Kyi and U tin Oo, vice chairman, and forced them to return to the capital, ending a nine-day standoff.  It is also reported that security personnel beat up the NLD youths, guarding the leaders, causing head wounds and injuries to nine.  They were not hospitalised and were sent to Insein prison.  It is reported that the following NLD youths are detained in Insein jail:  1- Htun Zaw Zaw ( Rangoon division) 2- Myo Nyunt (Rangoon division) 3- Htun Myint (same) 4- Thein Lwin (same) 5- Aung Htoo (same) 6- Khin Oo (same) 7- Moe Thaw (a) Pauk Pauk (same) 8- Myint Kyaw (same) 9- Shwe Gyo (same) 10- Than Htut (same) 11- Nyan Lin Aung (same) 12- Aye Myein Lin (same) 13- Than Htun (same) 14- Thein Swe (Irrawaddy Division) 15- Zaw Min Kyaw (same) 16- Min Aung Nyo (Mon State)  U Soe Myint (a member of CEC and Chairman of Rangoon Division NLD), and Dr. Myo Aung (member of Rangoon Division NLD organising committee) are also reportedly detained in Insein prison.
