URGENT APPEAL - THE OBSERVATORY

		 

KOR 001 / 0715 / OBS 060
		Detention / Judicial harassment
South Korea
		July 22, 2015

		 

		The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint 
programme of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the 
World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent intervention 
in the following situation in South Korea.

		 

Description of the situation:

		 

		The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the detention 
of Mr. Lae-Goon Park, a standing steering committee member 
of the Coalition 4.16 on the Sewol Ferry Disaster  (Coalition 4.16) 
which demands an independent investigatory commission be set up for the 
Sewol Ferry incident which happened on April 16, 2014.

		 

		According to the information received, on July 17, 2015, Mr. Park was 
detained by the Seoul Metropolitan Police in relation to his participation 
in a series of protests  to commemorate Sewol victims and for calling 
for an independent and transparent investigation into the Sewol Ferry 
incident. He is currently detained under a pre-indictment warrant, and is 
awaiting a possible indictment by the prosecutor’s office, which must 
be filed within 10 to 20 days following the beginning of his detention.

		 

		Police agents have claimed that Mr. Park incited sedition during protests 
and colluded with other human rights defenders to take violent action 
against the police. Such acts are punishable under the following Articles of 
the Criminal Code: Article 185 (“general obstruction of 
traffic”), Article 144 (“special obstruction of public 
duty”) and Article 141 (“invalidity of public documents” 
and “destruction of public goods”). According to Coalition 4.16, 
no conclusive evidence has been provided for Mr. Park’s involvement in 
inciting violent acts during the protests. To the contrary, Coalition 4.16 
has stated that Mr. Park tried to calm participants during the protests and 
asked them not to use any violence against authorities.

		 

		In addition, since April 2015, six protesters, including Mr.  
Hyung-Jae Ham  and Mr. Hyun-Sik Kim, two 
staff members from the People's Committee for the Sewol Tragedy, have 
been detained and face criminal charges for participating in the Sewol ferry 
tragedy protests .

		 

		The Observatory calls upon the South Korean authorities to immediately and 
unconditionally release Messrs. Lae-Goon Park, Hyung-Jae Ham, Hyun-Sik Kim 
and all peaceful protesters, and to drop all charges against them as these 
charges are related solely to their peaceful and legitimate human rights 
activities.

		 

Background information

		 

		After the Sewol ferry disaster on April 16, 2014, Sewol families and civil 
society organizations have continuously urged the Government to set up an 
independent investigatory commission to reveal the truth regarding the Sewol 
ferry disaster. The People’s Committee for the Sewol Ferry Tragedy, 
together with Sewol families, collected more than 3.5 million individual 
signatures calling for the enactment of a law to establish an independent 
and transparent investigation commission on the Sewol ferry disaster and 
submitted these signatures to the National Assembly on July 15, 2014.

		 

		After the submission, some Sewol families, individual citizens, and human 
rights defenders including Mr. Laegoon Park, went on hunger strike, 
demonstrated overnight in the street, and shaved their heads in protest 
calling for enactment of a Special Law on Sewol. The Special Law for Seeking 
Truth of the Sewol Ferry Disaster and Establishing Safer Society (Sewol 
Special Law) was finally enacted on November 7, 2014.

		 

		However, on March 27, 2015, the government announced an enforcement 
ordinance for the Sewol Special Law which human rights defenders say runs 
counter to the provisions of the law and risks denying the rights of victims 
and families to truth and adequate compensation. The members of Coalition 
4.16 therefore organised a series of protests to call for the abolishment of 
the enforcement decree and to commemorate Sewol victims and call for a truly 
independent and transparent investigation into the tragedy. During the 
protests in April and May 2015, physical clashes between protesters and 
police occurred and violence broke out.

		 

Actions requested:

		 

		The Observatory urges the authorities of South Korea to:

		 

		i. Immediately and unconditionally release Messrs. Lae-Goon Park, 
Hyung-Jae Ham, Hyun-Sik Kim and all peaceful protesters and put an end to 
all acts of harassment, including at the judicial level, against them as 
well as against all human rights defenders in South-Korea;

		 
	ii. Guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of Messrs. Lae-Goon 
Park, Hyung-Jae Ham, Hyun-Sik Kim and all peaceful protesters as well as all 
human rights defenders in South-Korea;
	
		 

		iii. Conform with the provisions of the Declaration on Human Rights 
Defenders, adopted on December 9, 1998 by the United Nations General 
Assembly, in particular:


		• its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, 
individually or in association with others, to promote the protection and 
realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and 
international levels” ;
		• its Article 5 (a) which states that “everyone has the right, 
individually and in association with others to meet or assemble 
peacefully” ; and
		• its Article 12 which states that “everyone has the right, 
individually and in association with others, to participate in peaceful 
activities against violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms. The 
State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the 
competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with 
others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure 
adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a 
consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in 
the present Declaration.”

		 1 After the Sewol ferry tragedy, South Korean civil 
society organizations established a network of more than 800 NGOs called
 the “People’s Committee for the Sewol Ferry Tragedy.” This Committee 
supported the Sewol victims’ families in their pursuit of the truth 
regarding the Sewol ferry tragedy. After the Special Law for Seeking 
Truth of the Sewol Ferry Disaster and Establishing Safer Society was 
enacted at the end of 2014, the Committee was transformed into the 
“Coalition 4.16 on the Sewol Ferry Disaster (Coalition 4.16)”, which 
also includes the membership of the Sewol families and individual 
supporters. The Coalition 4.16 has three standing steering committee 
members, one from each of these groups, and Mr. Park is one of them. 
Since then, most activities, including protests, have been organized 
under the Coalition 4.16’s name to show that families, civil society 
organisations, and individual supporters are jointly working towards 
truth regarding the Sewol ferry incident.2 
The protests for which Mr. Park is being detained were held on July 24, 
2014, to commemorate the 100 days since the Sewol ferry tragedy; on 
April 11, 2015, to call for the raising of the Sewol ferry; on April 16,
 2015, to commemorate the one year anniversary of the Sewol ferry 
tragedy; on April 18, 2015, to call for truth regarding the Sewol ferry 
tragedy; and on May 1 and 2, 2015, as an overnight protest to call for 
truth-seeking in the Sewol ferry tragedy.3 
On July 14, 2015 the prosecutor's office indicted Mr. Hyung-Jae Ham 
under Article 185 of the Criminal Code, for which he faces three years 
in prison.4 On 14 July 2015, the 
prosecutor’s office indicted Mr. Hyun-Sik Kim under Article 185 of the 
Criminal Code, for which he faces two years in prison.5 The
 four other protesters are Mr. Chang-Gun Kim, Mr. Jang-Hee Kwon, Mr. 
Kwang-Chul Kang and Mr. Gi-Ho Lee. The four deny having used violence 
during the protests.
