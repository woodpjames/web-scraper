Description of the situation: The Observatory has been informed by the Sudan Organisation Against Torture (SOAT) of the attempt to arrest arbitrarily Mr. Hassan Eltaib Yassin, a human rights defender in Port Sudan (Red Sea State). According to the information received, on May 13, 2008, members of the National Security and Intelligence Service (NISS) visited twice the house of Mr. Hassan Eltaib Yassin, first at 8 pm and a second time at 10 pm, allegedly to arrest him. On both occasions, they failed to find him. It is feared that this attempt of security agents to arrest Mr. Yassin might be due to his efforts to assist students who were detained by the NISS after clashes that occurred between students at the al-Bahr al-Ahmar University, in Port Sudan[1]. Indeed, on 11 May 2008, one of these students, Mr. Faries Abd Alhay Mohmed Ali, was detained and then allegedly subjected to abuse and ill-treatments by NISS members. The Observatory expresses its deep concern with the continuing interference on the activities of human rights defenders by the Sudanese authorities, and especially with Mr. Yassin’s physical and psychological integrity and security, and fears that such acts of intimidation directly aim at weakening the Sudanese independent civil society. Actions requested: Please write to the authorities of Sudan, urging them to:   Guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Hassan Eltaib Yassin;  Put an end to any act of harassment against him as well as against all Sudanese human rights defenders;  Comply with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, and Article 12.2, which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”;  More generally, ensure in all circumstances the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with international and regional human rights instruments ratified by Sudan.
