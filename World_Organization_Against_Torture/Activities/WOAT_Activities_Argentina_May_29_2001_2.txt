According to information received from the CAJ, the High Court (“Tribunal Superior”) of Neuquen province took a decision to request the local Bar Association (Colegio de Abogados) to take sanctions against Mariano Mansilla.  These sanctions will effectively put him at risk of forfeiting the right to exercise his profession.  Mariano Mansilla provides his services to the Central de Trabajadores Argentinos (Argentine Central Workers Union) and the Federación Mapuche de Argentina (Mapuche Federation of Argentina).  According to information received, harassment of Mr. Mariano Mansilla started the day after his return from Geneva where, together with his colleague, Advocate Matías Cremonte, he denounced the Argentine state policy of discrimination against Mapuches and immigrants which constitutes a violation of the International Covenant on Social and Economic Rights.  On his return, Mariano Mansilla gave an interview to the newspaper "La Mañana del Sur" during which he expressed his opinion on the cases he handles and was critical of the attitude of the government and of certain sectors of the Neuquen judicial authorities.  It is feared that the Neuquen High Court’s decision is in retaliation against the opinions expressed in this newspaper.  The Observatory stresses that the Court's decision is a violation of the right to defend and of freedom of opinion and is in contradiction with the Argentine Constitution (Articles 18 and following).  Action requested :  Kindly write to the Argentine authorities requesting them :  i.	to guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of Mariano Mansilla under all circumstances;  ii.	to take the necessary steps to guarantee the independence and impartiality of the judiciary and to ensure that arbitrary sanctions are not taken against Mariano Mansilla;  iii. to guarantee the application of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 9 December 1998, and in particular its first article which states that: "Everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels" and article 12, paragraph 2 which states that "The State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration".  iv.	in general, to comply with the terms of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and regional and international mechanisms concerning human rights to which Argentina is a party, in particular, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and of the American Convention on Human Rights.
