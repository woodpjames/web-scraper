documentary on a group of young people promoting democracy and human 
rights in the Democratic Republic of Congo, received the 2019 OMCT prize
at the Geneva International Film Festival and Forum on Human Rights 
(FIFDH). When
handing the award to its director, Marlène Rabaud, Gerald Staberock, 
OMCT Secretary General, said: “The Festival debated about the new 
threats facing human rights and asked whether we were regressing. 
Marlène Rabaud’s answer is loud and clear: hope is alive,
even in the DRC, even in the Kivus, even in those situations considered
as desperate, where torture and impunity have become the norm. This 
film is a tribute to the movements of young human rights defenders, not 
only in the DRC, but throughout the world. It
shows that things can change, that all of us can takes risks, and be 
actors and this fight.”
