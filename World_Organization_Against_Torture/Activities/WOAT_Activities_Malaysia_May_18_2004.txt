Brief description:  The Observatory has been  informed by Suara Rakyat Malaysia (SUARAM) of the physical attack and repeated acts of harassment against Mr. Ponnusamy Uthayakumar, a human rights lawyer and activist.  According to the information received, Mr. Uthayakumar was on his way home from his office, on Jalan Medang Tandok road in the Bangsar area of Kuala Lumpur, at around 7.15 pm on May 10, 2004, when he was attacked by three unidentified people wielding a sledge hammer. Reportedly, during the incident one of the attackers pointed a gun at Mr. Uthayakumar. Although he managed to escape, he sustained injuries on his body, face and head.  Mr. Uthayakumar had been subjected to acts of harassment in the past. On April 27, 2004, the windshield of his car was smashed. On April 30, 2004, he was arrested along with eleven persons while they were about to file a police complaint concerning a case of death in custody of a 23 year old. He was also arrested in January 2003 and held for two days after attending an inquiry concerning a case of death in custody. During this detention, he was abused, humiliated, stripped to the underwear and photographed and video taped in front of nine police officers. Mr. Uthayakumar was also denied legal representation. He was initially charged under Section 228 of the Penal Code (contempt of court) and Penal Code 506 (criminal intimidation) but all charges against him were dropped after protests organised by the Bar Council of Malaysia. The High Court found the charges were brought against him in bad faith.   The Observatory fears that these acts of harassment and the attack of May 10, 2004, are related to Mr. Uthayakumar’s human rights activities. He has been actively involved in investigating cases of abuse of police powers and deaths in police custody. In particular, during the last month, Mr. Uthayakumar has been actively working on the case of Francis Udayapan, who allegedly died while in police custody. This case has attracted public interest.  The Observatory is deeply concerned by these acts of harassment and threats to the life of Mr. Uthayakumar and urges authorities to conform with the provisions of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 9, 1998, in particular article 1, which states that "everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels” as well as its article 12.2 which provides that "the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually or in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration."   Actions requested:  Please write to the Malaysian authorities and ask them to:  i. Ensure in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Uthayakumar as well as other human rights defenders; ii. Order an  independent and impartial investigation into the attack on Mr. Uthayakumar, in order to identify those responsible, bring them before a civil, competent and impartial tribunal and apply the penal and/or administrative sanctions provided by law; iii. Put an end to any kind of harassment against human rights defenders in Malaysia; iv. conform to the provisions of the Declaration on Humans Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, in particular article 1 and 12.2 above mentioned; v. ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards.
