New Information The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Informal Sector Service Centre (INSEC), a member of the OMCT network, that Mr. Govind Thakur and Mr. Sushil Jha were released without charge after the court order on 21 November 2006. However, no investigation has been launched by the relevant authorities into the allegations of torture. The International Secretariat of OMCT welcomes the release of Mr. Govind Thakur and Mr. Sushil Jha. Nevertheless, it expresses its deep concern that no investigation was commenced into the allegations of torture. Reminder of the situation According to the information received, Mr. Govind Thakur (26), from Jaleshwar Municipality-4, was arrested on 3 November 2006 and detained at the Mahottari District Police Office, Jaleswar, on charge of theft. Mr. Govind Thakur was reportedly beaten with a polythene pipe during interrogation in order to extract his confession to the “crime”. According to the same information, Mr. Sushil Jha (21), from Jaleshwar Municipality-4, who had been handed over to the police by villagers based on allegations of burglary, had reportedly named Mr. Govind Thakur after the police had tortured him to reveal the name of his complice. Following intervention from INSEC district representative, police allowed Mr. Govind Thakur’s father, named Digambar, to meet his son in the presence of inspector Pokharel, right which was previously refused. Furthermore, the District Police Office reportedly only filed the case on 8 November 2006. The police brought the case to the district court on the same day and allegedly falsely reported that they arrested Mr. Govind Thakur on 8 November 2006. He was brought to the district court by the District Police Office on 9 November 2006. Actions required Kindly write to the authorities of Nepal urging them to:  Order a thorough and impartial investigation into these events, notably the allegations of torture, in order to identify all those responsible, bring them to trial and apply the penal and/or administrative sanctions as provided by law; Guarantee that adequate compensation is awarded to the victims; Ensure the respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
