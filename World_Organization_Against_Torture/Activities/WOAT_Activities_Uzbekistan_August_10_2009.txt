Description of the situation: The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the arbitrary detention of Mr. Farhodon Mukhtarov, an active and long-standing member of the Human Rights Alliance of Uzbekistan. According to the information received, on July 18, 2009, Mr. Farhodon Mukhtarov was arrested at the District Prosecutor's office as he was in the premises to submit a statement and a complaint against illegal actions carried out by police officers and investigator Boymatov. The Prosecutor decided indeed to report his visit to the police station, which came to arrest him directly at the Prosecutor's office. Mr. Mukhtarov was then brought to the Yunus-Abad police station. As of issuing this urgent appeal, Mr. Mukhtarov remained detained but no information could be obtained as to his place of detention nor as to the charges that would be held against him[1]. At the end of May 2009, Mr. Mukhtarov had already been briefly detained after a complaint had been reportedly filed against him by another Uzbek citizen, apparently for fraud, under Article 168, Part 2, paragraph A of the Uzbek Criminal Code. However, the authorities had refused to let him view the complaint. The Observatory expresses its utmost concern about Mr. Farhodon Mukhtarov’s arbitrary detention, and believes that these acts of harassment actually aim at sanctioning Mr. Mukhtarov's human rights activities. The latter had already been arrested in 2006 and later released following the mobilisation of the Human Rights Alliance and diplomats, and that his flat had been tentatively arsoned at the end of 2008. As a participating State of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the Observatory recalls that Uzbekistan recognises “the need for particular attention, support and protection for human rights defenders by the OSCE, its Institutions and field operations, as well as by participating States” . The Observatory further urges the European Commission Delegation as well as European Union (EU) Member-States embassies in the Uzbekistan to call upon the Uzbek authorities to comply with the relevant international norms and standards, in particular the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, and take action on the above-mentioned elements, in line with the EU Guidelines on Human Rights Defenders. Actions required: Please write to the Uzbek authorities urging them to:   Guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Farhodon Mukhtarov;  Disclose Mr. Mukhtarov's whereabouts and release him immediately and unconditionally since his detention is arbitrary as it only aims at sanctioning his human rights activities;  Put an end to all acts of harassment against Mr. Mukhtarov as well as all other human rights defenders in Uzbekistan;  Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels” and its Article 12.2, which states that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”;  Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by Uzbekistan.
