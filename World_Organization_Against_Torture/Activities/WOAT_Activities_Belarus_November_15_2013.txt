The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of
the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation
Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent intervention in the following
situation in Belarus.
 
Description of the situation:
 
The
Observatory was informed of the arrest and sentencing of Mr. Andrei
Bondarenko to five days of imprisonment. Mr. Bondarenko is the Director
of the human rights organisation “Platforma”, which monitors conditions of
detention in Belarus.
 
According
to the information received, on November 14, 2013, Mr. Bondarenko was charged
by the Minsk Moscow District Court under Part 1 of Article 23.34 of the
Administrative Code (“organising and carrying out unauthorised activities”) and
sentenced to five days of detention. He was appearing as a witness before the
court on that day, on the basis of a subpoena related to a judicial case about
a peaceful gathering which had happened two months before.
 
Indeed,
on September 14, 2013, 18 persons, including Mr. Bondarenko, were arrested
while they were holding a peaceful demonstration in front of pre-trial
detention facility n°1 on Volodarsky street in Minsk. They were celebrating the
memory of 21 year-old detainee Igor Ptichkin, who died in this pretrial
detention facility under suspicious circumstances on August 4, 2013. According
to Mr. Bondarenko, the young man was beaten and looked like a old man only
after a few days spent in detention.
 
The Observatory
expresses its concern about the arrest and detention of Mr. Bondarenko, and
considers it as a means to sanction his human rights activities.
 
Actions requested:
 
Please
write to the Belarusian authorities, urging them to :
 
i. Put an end to any kind
of harassment - including at the judicial and administrative levels - against
Mr. Bondareko, as well as against all other human rights defenders in Belarus;
 
ii. Release Mr. Bondarenko immediately and
unconditionally since his detention is arbitrary as it only aims at sanctioning
his human rights activities;
 
iii. Conform with the
provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the
General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially:
- its Article 1, which states that “everyone has
the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to
strive for the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental
freedoms at the national and international levels”,
- its Article 6 (b) and (c), which states that
“Everyone has the right, individually and in association with others […] as
provided for in human rights and other applicable international instruments,
freely to publish, impart or disseminate to others views, information and
knowledge on all human rights and fundamental freedoms and [...] to study,
discuss, form and hold opinions on the observance, both in law and in practice,
of all human rights and fundamental freedoms and, through these and other
appropriate means, to draw public attention to those matters”.
- and its Article 12.2, which provides that “the
State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the
competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others,
against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse
discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his
or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present
Declaration” ;
 
iv. Ensure in all
circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance
with international human rights standards and international instruments
ratified by the Belarusian Republic.
