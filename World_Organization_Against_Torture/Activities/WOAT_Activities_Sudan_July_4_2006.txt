Brief description of the situationThe International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Sudan Organisation Against Torture (SOAT), a member of the OMCT network, that in the early morning of 29 June 2006 unknonwn men attacked Kalma internally dispalced persons camp in Nyala, killing Mr. Haroun Salmani (50) and injuring Mr. Adam Musa Adam (65) and Ramadan Abdel Karmia Mohd (22). All men belong to the Fur tribe.   According to the information received, unknown men armed with JM3 machine guns and Kalashnikovs attacked the IDP camp at around 2.00 am. Mr. Haroun Salmani, employed as a watchman for the Care International Water Pump in sector 7 was shot dead whilst he was sleeping. Furthermore, the bicycle of Mr. Adam Musa Adam was stolen and he was shot was in the left foot. Following the gunshot, IDP’s in sector 7 found three empty shells and two full cartridges which have been handed over to AMIS. Moreover, Mr. Ramadan Abdel Karmia Mohd was shot in his left shoulder and received injuries to his left hand. Both men are currently receiving medical treatment at Nyala hospital.  The International Secretariat of OMCT urges the Sudanese authorities to immediately implement its obligations as agreed in the Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA). The International Secretariat of OMCT together with SOAT expresses its grave concern over the continued targeting of the civilian population in Darfur by armed groups which undermines one of the fundamental principles of the DPA namely article 23 (217): “To ensure that civilians are not subjected to violence, intimidation, threats and forced displacement”.  It should be recalled that article 27(315) of the DPA requires the Government of Sudan to “restrict all Janjaweed/armed militia and PDF to their headquarters, garrisons, cantonment sites or communities and take other steps to contain, reduce and ultimately eliminate the threat posed by such forces”. Furthermore, article 27 (317) states that “Government of Sudan, with support from AMIS, shall take all other steps required to completely eliminate the threat posed by Janjaweed/armed militia to the civilian population....”.  Furthermore the International Secretariat of OMCT together with SOAT urges the Sudanese Government in the light of the continuing instability and attacks on civilians despite the DPA, the N’djamena Ceasefire agreement and the UNSC resolutions, to immediately provide both political and financial support to AMIS to ensure the mission is capable and able to effectively fulfil the protection role of its mandate in the transitional period before the UN takeover through the provision of:  i.  Satisfactory protection provisions including resuming the provision of armed escort for women and girls venturing outside IDP camps;  ii.  Fulfil its functions as stipulated in the DPA particularly verifying and monitoring the disarmament of the Janjaweed militias and other militias; iii.   Continue to place pressure on the various armed groups to sign the DPA and the Declaration of Commitment to the DPA to sign the peace agreement.
