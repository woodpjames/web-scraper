Incommunicado detention
Saudi Arabia
January 12, 2017
 
The Observatory for
the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a partnership of FIDH and the World
Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent intervention in the
following situation in Saudi Arabia.
 
Description of the
situation:
 
The Observatory has been
informed by reliable sources about the arrest and incommunicado detention of Messrs. Ahmed Al-Mshikhs,
co-founder of Al-Adalah Centre for Human Rights in Saudi Arabia, known for
promoting protect civil and political rights in the country, and Essam
Koshak, a prominent voice on issues of corruption and freedom of
expression in Saudi Arabia.
 
According to the information
received, on January 5, 2017, Mr. Ahmed Al-Mshikhs was summoned by the Criminal
Investigation Department in Al-Qatif. On arrival, he was arrested and detained
in Al-Qatif police prison for unknown reasons. On January 8, 2017, he was
transferred to the Bureau of Investigation and Public Prosecution in Al-Dammam.
As of January 12, 2017, he remained held in Al-Dammam general prison without
charge, pending further investigation.
 
On January 8, 2017 the
Criminal Investigation Department in Mecca summoned Mr. Essam Koshak. On
arrival, he was arrested for unknown reasons and detained in Al-Mansour police
station until late evening hours before being released and ordered to appear
before the Bureau of Investigation and Public Prosecution in Mecca the next
day. On January 9, 2017, he presented himself to the Bureau of Investigation
and Public Prosecution in Mecca and was re-arrested. On January 10, 2017, the
Bureau of Investigation and Public Prosecution in Mecca extended his detention
for another four days without charge, pending further investigation.
 
As of publication of this
appeal, both defenders had no access to their lawyers.
 
The Observatory condemns the
incommunicado detention of Messrs. Ahmed Al-Mshikhs and Essam Koshak as it
appears to be a form of retaliation for their legitimate human rights
activities, and urges
the authorities in Saudi Arabia to immediately and unconditionally release them.
 
Actions requested:
 
Please write to the authorities of Saudi Arabia and ask them to:
 
i.
Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Messrs. Ahmed Al-Mshikhs and
Essam Koshak and all human
rights defenders in Saudi Arabia;
 
ii. Release immediately and
unconditionally Messrs.
Ahmed Al-Mshikhs and Essam Koshak as their detention is
arbitrary since it only seems to aim at sanctioning their human rights
activities;
 
iii. Guarantee the access of Messrs. Ahmed Al-Mshikhs and Essam Koshak to
their lawyers;
 
iv.
Put an end to all acts of harassment - including at the judicial level -
against Messrs.
Ahmed Al-Mshikhs and Essam Koshak and all human rights defenders in
Saudi Arabia;
 
v.
Conform in any circumstances with the provisions of the United Nations
Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted on December 9, 1998 by the UN
General Assembly, in particular its Articles 1, 6, 8, 9 and 12.2;
 
vi.
Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms
in accordance with international human rights instruments ratified by Saudi
Arabia.
