Brief description of the situationThe International Secretariat of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) has been informed by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), a member of the OMCT network, that 14 demonstrators are still being held in police custody in Hong Kong following mass arrests made during a protest rally on December 17th 2005.  The 14 are being held on a charge of illegal assembly and may face the more serious charge of assaulting the police. They are due to face trial on December 23rd 2005.   The demonstrators were Korean farmers protesting at the rising poverty and unemployment they face as result of trade policies, and their supporters. According to the information received, most of those in custody are Korean, and include members of the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU). The 14 also include one Taiwanese from a labour website called Coolloud web, two Japanese and one mainland Chinese.     OMCT has been informed of the excessive use of force by the police against the protestors, and of the use of tear gas and pepper spray. Reports suggest that about 60 people suffered injuries as a result of the heavy handed intervention of the police, and three had to be hospitalised. In addition, according to the information received, ill treatment of those in custody has also been reported.
