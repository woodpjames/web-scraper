The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in Bahrain.
Description of the situation:
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the recent restrictions imposed by the authorities to the Bahrain Human Rights Society (BHRS), an organisation that promotes human rights in Bahrain.
According to the information received, on April 19, 2010, BHRS received a letter from the Ministry of Social Development (MoSD) denying them the permission to organise a workshop on capacity-building on human rights, scheduled to be held from May 27 to May 29, 2010 in collaboration with the Association for the Prevention of Torture (APT). The agenda intended to cover issues such as the monitoring of preventive detention, admission to places of detention, human rights in the period of detention with a focus on the basic rules for the treatment of prisoners, managing preventive visit to detention places, Istanbul Protocol, the use of international human rights mechanisms, and the Optional Protocol to the United Nations Convention against Torture.
Indeed, on March 21, 2010, BHRS had sent a letter to MoSD urging them to facilitate their visa request for their foreign participants to the workshop. Indeed, since several months, the Directorate of Immigration and Passports (DoIP) is reportedly no longer able to deliver visas without the approval of MoSD. This approval was denied for BHRS participants on the ground that the workshop contradicts with the Bahraini Law of association[1], which provides that “the association may not get involved in political activities”. The BHRS wrote to MoSD to ask them to reconsider their decision.
The Observatory denounces the recent restrictions on freedom of association in Bahrain applied by the MoSD and considers that the concept of “political activities” as defined in the law is unclear and that its general prohibition lead to impede NGOs from carrying through their activities in violation of the right to freedom of association guaranteed by the Bahraini Constitution[2] and by the international instruments ratified by Bahrain.
The Observatory urges the Bahraini authorities to ensure BHRS, as well as all human rights defenders, the ability to carry out their work without unjustified hindrances conforming to the Bahraini's legislation.
