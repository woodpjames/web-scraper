The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of
the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and the International Federation
for Human Rights (FIDH), has received new information and requests your urgent
intervention in the following situation in Sri
Lanka.
 
New
information:
 The Observatory has been informed by
reliable sources that on February 10, 2011, a
hearing in the case of the disappearance of Mr. Pattani Razeek, Managing
Trustee of the Community Trust Fund (CTF) and a member of the Executive
Committee of the Asian Forum for Human Rights and Development (FORUM-ASIA),
should have been held in Puttalam High Court in Sri Lanka. 
 On February 10, 2011, the Puttalam High Court was due to examine an
anticipatory bail application made by Mr. Shabdeen Nowshadh[1],
the main suspect in the
disappearance of Mr. Razeek, but it decided to postpone the hearing to March
23, 2011. Mr. Nowshadh's first application for an
anticipatory bail application was first rejected by the Court in June 2010. He appealed the decision to the High Court and finally obtained his
application to be heard in December 2010. The hearing was then postponed to
February 3, 2011 and then to February 10, 2011. 
 According to the information
received, the criminal investigation led by the police on Mr. Razeek’s
disappearance is ongoing and Mr. Shabdeen Nowshadh, Chairman of a Subcommittee
of the CTF and reportedly close acquaintance of the Minister of Industry and
Commerce, has been identified as the
main suspect by the police. Police
investigations reportedly revealed that Mr. Nowshadh had used Mr. Razeek’s mobile phone to call his residence after the
abduction. Moreover, Mr. Nowshadh
reportedly confirmed that he had met Mr. Razeek on February 11, 2010 at the
Jumma Mosque, Kaduruwela, Pollonaruwa, as he was traveling with Minister Rishad Bathiudeen, amongst other
persons.
 The Observatory also
highlights that, according to the information received, following the
disappearance Mr. Pattani Razeek, Mr. Irashad, Coordinator of the Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad
Bathirudeen, reportedly made a public statement claiming that Mr. Razeek had
acted as an intermediary to the transfer of funds from Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA) to the IS to the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and that Mr. Razeek was detained in
the custody of the Defense Secretary. However, to date, his whereabouts are
unknown to his family and colleagues.
 The Observatory is deeply concerned by the non-resolution of Mr.
Pattani Razeek’s disappearance case one year later, and by the apparent
unwillingness of the police to arrest the main suspect in spite of the serious
evidence highlighting the alleged involvement of Mr. Shabdeen Nowshadh in the case.
 Background information
 Mr. Pattani Razeek has been missing since February 11,
2010. According to the information received, he was last seen in Polonnaruwa,
a town in the North Central Province of Sri Lanka, in the afternoon of February
11, 2010. Mr. Razeek was then travelling together with other staff members of
CTF on their way home from a mission when their van was intercepted by another
vehicle, a white van[2].
 Mr. Pattani Razeek approached the men in the white van and exchanged greetings with them. After talking to them for some minutes, Mr. Razeek went back to his colleagues and told them that he would continue his journey in the white van that according to him was heading to the Eastern
provincial town of Valaichchenai, telling them that he would meet them later. 
 On February 12, 2010, the CTF was
informed by Mr. Razeek’s family that he never returned home from the mission.
Since then, his whereabouts remain
unknown.
 On February 16, 2010, Mr. Razeek’s family was able to
convince his mobile phone company to release some of the phone records coming
from his mobile phone. The records revealed that a number of short calls were
made from Mr. Razeek’s mobile phone on the evening of February 11, the day he
was last seen by his colleagues. On February 15, 2010, a call from Mr. Razeek’s
mobile phone was made to a CTF driver, but it was missed. When the call was
returned, there was no answer. On the same day, a text message was sent from
Mr. Razeek’s mobile phone to a
member of his family, in which he assured that he was in Polonnaruwa town and
that he would be coming back home soon. Since then, there has been no further
contacts, nor responses to calls and
text messages.
 Subsequently, Mr. Pattani Razeek’s family lodged a complaint within the
local police authorities in the city of Puttalam. They also filed a complaint with the Human Rights Commission of
Sri Lanka. However, the Commission has never been in touch with Mr. Razeek’s
family or friends. 
 Actions requested:
 Please write to the authorities of Sri Lanka asking them to:
 i.                    
Take prompt action in order
to disclose the whereabouts of Mr. Pattani
Razeek and ensure his immediate release;
 
 ii.                  
Guarantee in all circumstances
the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Pattani Razeek;
 iii.                 
Question Mr. Nowshadh
on his possible involvement in the disappearance of Mr. Razeek; 
 
iv.                
Immediately order a thorough,
effective and impartial investigation into Mr. Pattani Razeek’s enforced disappearance, the result of which must be made public, in order to identify all those responsible, bring
them before a competent and impartial tribunal and apply to them the penal
sanctions provided by the law;
 v.                  
Conform with the provisions
of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, especially:
 -         
its article 1, which states
that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to
promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and
fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”;
-         
and its article 9.5, which
provides that “the state should conduct a prompt and impartial investigation or
ensure that an inquiry takes place whenever there is a reasonable ground to
believe that a violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms has occurred
in any territory under its jurisdiction”.
