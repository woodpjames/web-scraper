Brief description of the situation The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by a reliable source and Antenna International, a member organisation of OMCT SOS-Torture Network, about the arbitrary detention and ill-treatment suffered by Ms. Cao Yibao, a 57-year-old petitioner from Shanghai. According to the information received, on 26 December 2008, Ms. Cao Yibao was picked off from the street by police in Beijing and first sent to Ma Jia Lou, a centralised “black jail” where petitioners intercepted by Beijing police are sent, and then transferred to another black jail managed by the Shanghai Municipal Government in Beijing. Ms. Cao Yibao was later on that evening brought to the Beijing Liaison Office of Baoding City, Hebei Province, where she was reportedly strip-searched, and had her ID, cell phone, and money taken. According to the same information, when Ms. Cao Yibao, angered by this treatment, verbally lashed out at the interceptors, she was violently beaten, seriously injuring her face and head, as well as fracturing her eye sockets, on the orders of Shanghai Municipal government officials. Later, Ms. Cao Yibao, along with other detained, was held in a reportedly freezing room with insufficient food. On 27 December 2008, Ms. Cao Yibao was reportedly forcibly returned to Shanghai by train. There, she visited various government offices, which rejected her request to have her injuries examined and lodge complaints against the alleged officials. According to the information received, Ms. Cao Yibao paid for a medical examination at Shanghai No. 9 People’s Hospital. She was diagnosed with multiple fractures to bones in her face, and she was recommended an emergency surgery to avoid risks of infection. The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned about these events, in particular the allegations of ill-treatment and the lack of an effective investigation thereon. OMCT recalls that China is a State party to the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment which prohibits torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. In line with their obligations under this treaty, it is incumbent on the Chinese authorities to consider seriously any allegations of torture and ill-treatment, and to undertake a thorough and impartial investigation in this regard. Actions Requested Please write to the authorities in the People’s Republic of China urging them to:   Guarantee, in all circumstances, the physical and psychological integrity of Ms. Cao Yibao;  Order a prompt, thorough and impartial investigation into these events, in particular the allegations of ill-treatment, in order to identify all those responsible, bring them to trial and apply the penal and/or administrative sanctions as provided by law;  Ensure that adequate, effective and prompt reparation, including adequate compensation, proper medical care and rehabilitation, is granted to the victim;   Guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
