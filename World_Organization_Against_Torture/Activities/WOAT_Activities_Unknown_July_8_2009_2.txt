New information: The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources that Mr. Abdolfattah Soltani, a lawyer at the Bar of Tehran and a founding member of the Defenders of Human Rights Centre (DHRC), who had disappeared since June 16, 2009[1], has now been located in section 209 of Evin prison. According to the information received, Mr. Abdolfattah Soltani, a long-standing human rights defender who has already been repressed on several occasions in the past, was recently able to contact his relatives. First detained in section 240 of Evin prison, in Tehran, he was subsequently transferred to section 209, where political prisoners are detained. As of issuing this urgent appeal, no information could be obtained as to whether charges were brought against him. The Observatory expresses its deep concern about Mr. Abdolfattah Soltani’s arbitrary detention, all the more as it takes place in the context of the current general crackdown on the Iranian civil society. The Observatory therefore calls upon the Iranian authorities to immediately and unconditionally release Mr. Soltani and all human rights defenders presently detained in Iran, and more generally to put an end to all forms of harassment against them. Actions requested: Please write to the Iranian authorities and ask them to:   Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Abdolfattah Soltani and all human rights defenders in Iran;  Release Mr. Abdolfattah Soltani immediately and unconditionally since his detention is arbitrary as it seems to merely aim at sanctioning his human rights activities;  Put an end to acts of harassment against all human rights defenders in Iran;  Conform in any circumstances with the provisions of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted on December 9, 1998 by the United Nations General Assembly, in particular its article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually or in association with others, to promote the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, its article 5(c), which reads that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, at the national and international levels, [...] to communicate with non-governmental or intergovernmental organizations”, and its article 12.2 which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”;  Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by Iran.
