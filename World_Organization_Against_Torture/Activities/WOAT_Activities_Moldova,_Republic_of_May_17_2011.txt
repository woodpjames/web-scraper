Follow-up of the case MDA 210411 
Threats/ Denial of adequate medical care/
Fear for the safety
The
International Secretariat of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) has received new information on the following situation in
the Republic of Moldova/ Region of Transnistria.
New information
The
International Secretariat of OMCT has
been informed by a reliable source and Antenna International, a member
organisation of OMCT SOS-Torture Network, that Mr. Illie Cazac,a 25-year-old resident of Tighina
(Bender), who was arrested by members of the Ministry of State Security (MGB)
of the unrecognized Transnistrian authorities (Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic[1] or PMR, also
known as "Pridnestrovie"), on 20 March 2010, allegedly tortured and ill-treated
in custody, and later sentenced to 14 years in prison
“for grand treason and espionage in favour of the Republic of Moldova”, remains
detained in Tiraspol Penitentiary no.2, without access to an
independent doctor and at risk of further threats and harassment. 
According
to the information received, although Mr. Illie Cazac was allowed, on 22 April
2011, to receive from his mother some food and medicines as well as to have a
daily phone call with his family, he was also forced to provide a written
explanation to the prison administration on how his case became known at the
international level. Furthermore, according to the same information received,
two criminal detainees, who had been previously detained along with Mr. Illie
Cazac in Penitentiary no. 1/ Glinaia in summer 2010, and who had allegedly
beaten and threatened him with death and rape, were recently transferred to Tiraspol Penitentiary no.2 without any
particular reason. OMCT fears for the safety of Mr. Illie Cazac. 
According to the same information received, on 22 April 2011, Mr. Illie Cazac’s mother was informed that he would be allowed to
“invite” a doctor to examine him, albeit only a doctor practising in the Transnistrian region. In the meantime, Mr. Illie Cazac
was examined, on 26 and 27 April 2011, by a stomatologist
from the prison’s medical unit with regard to his toothaches. The doctor
reportedly suggested him to extract six to seven teeth as the prison’s medical
unit is not equipped to treat dental caries, which he refused. On 16 May 2011, after complaining about chest pain, Mr. Illie Cazac
was reportedly again examined by a doctor from the medical unit and had an
electrocardiogram (ECG). However, he was reportedly not properly informed by
the doctor about the diagnosis and the medicines his mother would need to buy
for him. Mr. Illie Cazac would also suffer from digestive and gastric problems.

OMCT
reiterates its previous call to the de facto Transnistrian authorities to
guarantee that Mr. Illie
Cazac is promptly examined by an independent doctor and to allow his transfer
to a hospital where he can receive adequate medical care. More generally, OMCT remains gravely concerned about the safety and physical and
psychological integrity of Mr. Ilie Cazac and of his family and reiterates its
call to the de facto Transnistrian authorities to guarantee his safety at all
times. 
 
Background information
OMCT
had earlier been informed about
the arrest and detention of Mr. Illie Cazac, an appointed
inspector at the city’s
tax inspectorate, on 20 March 2010, on alleged charges of “state betrayal” and “espionage in favor of
the Republic of Moldova” (according to the version of the Transnistrian authorities). To
date, the details of the accusations remain unclear. After Mr. Ilie Cazac’s arrest, his home was also reportedly searched by
members of the MGB. 
According
to the information received, Mr.
Ilie Cazac was arrested at home, in the city of
Tighina, and first held incommunicado. His family was not informed about
his arrest and fate for two weeks. Mr. Cazac allegedly suffered torture and
ill-treatment, including beatings and conditions of detention amounting to
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, with a view of extracting a “confession”
(see Urgent appeal MDA 240111).
According to the same information, Mr. Ilie Cazac was assisted in court
by a lawyer appointed by the de facto Transnistrian authorities after being refused a lawyer from outside
the region. This lawyer allegedly never informed on the details of the case. On
9
February 2011, following a trial held
behind closed doors, Mr. Ilie Cazac was reportedly sentenced by the Supreme
Court of the Transnistrian region to 14 years in prison. 
Mr. Ilie Cazac was subsequently transferred to the Tiraspol Penitentiary no.2,
where he has remained detained in poor health. He complained of terrible
toothaches and inflammation but he was refused any adequate medical care and
treatment. 
OMCT has also been informed
that Mr. Ilie Cazac’s family
has been repeatedly harassed, intimidated and threatened since his arrest by
representatives of the de facto Transnistrian authorities, with the result that
his family was forced to leave its home in Tighina.

iii.                 
Order his immediate
release;
iv.

tribunal and apply penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions as provided by

[1] The Transnistrian
region broke away from Moldova, declaring
independence unilaterally in 1990. The self proclaimed Pridnestrovian
Moldavian Republic (PMR) is not recognized by the
international community. Tighina (Bender) is a town controlled by the
authorities of the Republic of Moldova and of the
self-proclaimed Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic. Since the Moldovan-Russian Agreement on 21 July 1992, Tighina (Bender) is under a
strong Russian peacekeeping presence.
