​We the undersigned call on
Bahraini authorities to release Nabeel Rajab immediately, to repeal his convictions and sentences, and drop all
charges against him. On 31 December 2018 the Court of Cassation in Bahrain may
issue its verdict in the appeal of the
five-year prison sentence handed to him for peaceful
comments posted and retweeted on his Twitter account about the killing of
civilians in the Yemen conflict by the Saudi Arabia-led coalition, and
allegations of torture in Jau prison.
We are concerned that the
authorities intend to increase Rajab's prison sentence unopposed, by setting 31
December as the date for a hearing and possible issuing of a verdict, while
most Bahrainis and people around the globe will be focused on year-end celebrations.
This is not an idle concern, as, opposition leader Sheikh Ali Salman was
arrested on 28 December 2014 and subsequently convicted and sentenced to four
years in jail following an unfair trial. And last month, in yet another case
brought against him on spying charges, the Court of Appeal overturned his
initial acquittal and sentenced him instead to life in prison.
Rajab has been a tireless
champion of human rights for many years, helping to found and run the Bahrain
Center for Human Rights and the Gulf Centre for Human Rights, both members of
the IFEX network.
He has been detained since
his arrest on 13 June 2016. He was held largely in solitary
confinement during the first nine
months of his detention, violating UN rules on pre-trial imprisonment, and has
been subjected to humiliating treatment. His books, toiletries, and clothes
have been confiscated and his cell frequently raided at night.
Rajab was sentenced to two years in jail in 2017 on charges of “publishing and broadcasting false news
that undermines the prestige of the state” during TV interviews he gave in 2015
and 2016 in which he stated that Bahraini authorities bar reporters and human
rights workers from entering the country. He was sentenced in 2018 to five
years in prison on charges of “disseminating false rumors in times of war” for
tweets about torture in Jau Prison and the war in Yemen.
At
its eighty-first session, 17-26 April 2018, the
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention concluded that Rajab's “deprivation of
liberty constitutes a violation of articles 2 and 7 of the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights and articles 2 (1) and 26 of the Covenant – on the grounds of
discrimination based on political or other opinion, as well as on his status as
a human rights defender”. 
We therefore urge Bahraini
authorities to immediately
and unconditionally release Nabeel Rajab, quash his
convictions and sentences, and drop all charges against him; and undertake a
prompt, impartial, independent and effective investigation into his allegations
of ill-treatment. The findings of the investigation must be made public and
anyone suspected of criminal responsibility must be brought to justice in fair
proceedings.
As this case is part of a
pattern of abuse and harassment against human rights defenders and journalists
in Bahrain, we also urge the authorities to cease all such actions and ensure
that the right to freedom of expression and freedom of the press is respected.
