The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint 
programme of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and the International 
Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), requests your urgent intervention in the 
following situation in Sri Lanka.
 
Brief description of the information:
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about acts of 
intimidation and harassment against Mr. Asela Bandara Ihagama, a human rights defender who works at the Commission for Justice, Peace, Human Development, 
Human Rights Secretariat in Kandy, (also known as SETIK-Caritas Kandy). At 
SETIK, Mr. Ihagama has been involved in 
documenting human rights abuses including torture and assisting victims of 
torture and rape and their families since 1998. In particular, he has provided 
information to international bodies and has campaigned actively to raise human 
rights awareness and against rights abuses, particularly among the Estate 
Tamils.
 
According to the information received, on March 6, 2012, Mr. Asela Bandara Ihagama was forced to cancel the 
annual women’s day event which he had organised for SETIK-Caritas Kandy, 
following an order by the Office in Charge (OIC) of the Hatton police, 
prohibiting any public event to take place in Hatton from March 6 to 8, 2012. 
The event was to be held in Hatton on March 7, and all arrangements had been 
made when the police informed that the event should not be held at around 6.30 
pm on March 6. Around 500 women from the estate community were expected to 
participate in the event, which focused on violence against women, in particular 
domestic violence. The OIC told Mr. Ihagama that no public gathering or 
celebration would be permitted since it would disrupt preparations for the 
women’s day celebrations organised by the Government, in Hatton, to which over 
5,000 Sinhala women from Anuradhapura and Pollonnaruwa were due to participate. 
The OIC said that all buses and vehicles would be prevented from entering Hatton 
town from March 6 to 8, and threatened that any gathering of more than five 
persons would result in arrests by the police. As a result, Mr. Ihagama and his staff were forced to 
cancel the event planned for the following day and to return to the city of 
Kandy that night.
 
Moreover, Mr. Asela Bandara Ihagama has been subjected to a series 
of threats, intimidation and surveillance by State intelligence officers since 
January 2012. On January 29, officers from the Criminal Investigations 
Department (CID) visited his village and questioned neighbours about his work. 
On February 9, Mr. Ihagama was questioned at his office 
by an officer from the Terrorism Investigation Department (TID) who said that 
the TID had received information that Mr. Ihagama was working to support the 
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) among the estate community and was 
providing information to international groups, including through their websites 
in order to discredit the Government. 
 
On February 19, 2012, at around 8 pm, a group of men in a white van were 
seen parked near a funeral house Mr. Ihagama had visited in the morning in 
his neighbourhood (around 30 meters from his house). When neighbours asked the 
men where they had come from and what they were doing there, they replied that 
they knew Mr. Ihagama and had come from Colombo. 
They also questioned the neighbours regarding Mr. Ihagama’s work and the details of his 
family members. They left at around 10.15 pm.
 
On February 20, 2012, men visited Mr. Ihagama’s office in Kandy and asked 
the caretaker whether he was in 
office, telling him that that they were Mr. Ihagama’s friends and wished to speak 
with him. The caretaker informed them that Mr. Ihagama had not come to office since 
it was a holiday on that day and offered to give him a message. The men refused to 
leave a message and left shortly after. Mr. Ihagama believes that these men were 
intelligence officers since any of his friends would have called him before 
visiting the office. 
 
The Observatory expresses its great concern about 
the obstacles to Mr. Asela Bandara Ihagama’s human rights activities as well as 
the threats, surveillance and acts of harassment against him, which seem 
to merely aim at sanctioning his peaceful activities.
