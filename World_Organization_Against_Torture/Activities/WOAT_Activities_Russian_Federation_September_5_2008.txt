Brief description of the situation The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by a reliable source and by Antenna International, a member of OMCT SOS-Torture network, about the sentencing of Messrs. Sergey Baranov and Alexey Makarov, two members of the banned National-Bolshevik Party (NBP) party, subsequent to their participation in a peaceful protest denouncing the 2004 Beslan school hostage-taking. According to the information received, on 3 September 2008, Messrs. Sergey Baranov and Alexey Makarov were sentenced by the Moscow Presnenskiy District Court to five days in custody after they mounted, on the same day, a slogan saying “Putin is an executioner of Beslan” from the roof of house #2 in Krasnopresnenskaya embankment. They were charged with “minor misdemeanour”, under Article 20.1 of the Administrative Code, because the building is situated in front of the White House, the office of the Russian Government. They also disseminated fliers which stated, “Who but you, citizen Vladimir Putin, gave the order to storm the school? It is because of you that tanks and grenade launchers shot at the school. Who didn’t leave any chances for the children to survive just “to keep your image”? Where were your subordinates, the Heads of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) and of the Federal Security Service (FSB) Nurgaliev and Patrushev, at the time of the act of terror?” The flier ends with the statement, “We are mourning but we are not going to remain silent”. Messrs. Sergey Baranov and Alexey Makarov are currently detained in a SIZO (a pre-trial detention facility) in Guilyarovskiy Street, in Moscow. The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned for the safety of Messrs. Sergey Baranov and Alexey Makarov, who seemed to have been arrested and sentenced solely for their rights to freedom of expression. Action requested Please write to the authorities in Russia urging them to:   Guarantee, in all circumstances, the physical and psychological integrity of Messrs. Sergey Baranov and Alexey Makarov;  Guarantee immediate and unconditional access to their lawyers and family;  Order their immediate release in the absence of valid legal charges that are consistent with international law and standards, or if such charges exist, bring them before an impartial and competent tribunal and guarantee their procedural rights at all times;  Ensure the respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
