The
International Secretariat of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT)
requestsyour URGENT intervention
in the following situation in India/ Manipur.
Brief description of the situation
The International Secretariat
of OMCT has been informed by the Centre for Organisation Research &
Education (CORE), a member of the OMCT SOS-Torture Network, about the alleged
torture and ill-treatment to which Ms. Leishiwon
Mashangva, a 37-year-old woman from New Canaan village, Mr. Surrender Hungyo, a 45-year-old man
from New Canaan village, and Mr. Chihansing
Chithung, a 22-year-old man from Nungsong village, were subjected during
their detention by members of the Manipur Police Commandos, in the city of Imphal,
in the state of Manipur. All three are members of the Tangkhul Naga tribe. 
According to the information
received, on 19 August 2011 at about 3:45 pm, after collecting pig-feed near
the Imphal river, Ms. Leishiwon Mashangva, Mr.Surrender Hungyo andMr.
Chihansing Chithung were waiting for a vehicle near the India Reserve Battalion
(IRB) gate, at Khuman Lampak, in Imphal, when three unidentified individuals in
plain-clothes (one of them reportedly wore camouflage trousers), alleged to be
members of the Manipur Police Commandos, arrived and asked them what they were
doing at that place. The three policemen then forced Ms. Leishiwon Mashangva,
Mr.Surrender Hungyo andMr. Chihansing Chithung to follow them
without any warrant of arrest or giving any reason. They were forced into a
white Maruti van and they were first taken to the Sport Complex in Khuman
Lampak, where the policemen reportedly asked passers-by to identify Ms. Leishiwon
Mashangva, Mr.Surrender Hungyo andMr. Chihansing Chithung. The policemen
then brought them to a house located in Khuman Lampak from where the policemen
took some clothes. These were subsequently used to blindfold Ms. Leishiwon
Mashangva, Mr.Surrender Hungyo andMr. Chihansing Chithung. It was
reportedly already dark when they arrived at the police commando camp in Khuman
Lampal. 
According to the same
information received, at the aforementioned police camp, Ms. Leishiwon
Mashangva, Mr.Surrender Hungyo andMr. Chihansing Chithung were severely
beaten by the police for about three hours and accused of being members of an
armed opposition group who came to plant bombs. 
Ms. Leishiwon Mashangva was
reportedly so severely beaten all over her body that she could not open her
mouth to eat and walk or sit up properly. Her right cheek and eye were swollen
and her jaw was badly hurt. She was allegedly asked to sign on a paper but she
refused as she cannot read. She was released on bail the following day, on 20 August 2011, after she was produced
before a magistrate. Mr. Surrender Hungyo was also reportedly severely beaten
all over his body causing him difficulty walking. Furthermore, he was
threatened with being shot if he refused to admit. The police reportedly took
his signature on papers without explaining the content of the paper. He was
released on bail, on 26 August
2011, but has to report on fixed dates to the Imphal Police station. Mr. Chihansing
Chithung was reportedly forced to strip before the police poured water all over
his body and started to beat him. One of his forefingers was broken. The police
then allegedly forced him to admit of being in possession of four bullets. He
was released on bail, on 30 August 2011, but has to report
on fixed dates to the Imphal Police station. None of them was examined by a
doctor or had access to a lawyer during their detention.
According to the same
information, Ms. Leishiwon Mashangva, Mr.Surrender Hungyo andMr. Chihansing
Chithung were only taken by their friends, upon their respective release, to a
private hospital in Dewlahland, in Imphal. A senior Superintendent of police
(SI) of Imphal West District reportedly later denied the allegations of torture
and ill-treatment in a local newspaper. To date, no effective investigation has
been reportedly carried out into the aforementioned event. 
The International Secretariat of OMCT is
gravely concerned about the safety of Ms. Leishiwon Mashangva, Mr.Surrender Hungyo andMr. Chihansing Chithung and urges the
competent authorities to guarantee their physical and
psychological integrity at all times. OMCT recalls that the
authorities have to fulfil their obligations under international human rights
law to protect the right not to be subjected to torture or other cruel, inhuman
or degrading treatment or punishment and to bringing to justice those
responsible for violating this right.
Accordingly,
OMCT calls upon the competent authorities to undertake a prompt, effective, thorough, independent and impartial
investigation into the aforementioned allegations, in order to identify all
those responsible, bring them to trial and apply adequate sanctions.
