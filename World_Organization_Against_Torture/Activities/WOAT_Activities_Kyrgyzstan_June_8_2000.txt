New Information :  The Observatory for human rights defenders has been informed by the Kyrgyz Committee for Human Rights (KCHR), a member of the OMCT network, that Ramazan Dyryldaev, Chairman of the KCHR, was informed on 31st May 2000 of a case opened against him on April 7th 2000 by District Prosecutor Toktomambetov under Article 338 of the Criminal Code.  This article refers to the fraudulent non-execution of the court's sentence, its decisions or any other judicial act.  The accusation is related to a complaint made by Eliseev, former acting deputy chair of the KCHR who was fired from his position, in December 1997, for creating a bad atmosphere and avoiding fulfilling his responsibilities.  He is claiming compensation for moral damage, estimated at 500,000 soms as well as legal costs.  A first trial already took place on May 23rd 1999, when the KCHR was deregistered and replaced by a bogus association, directed by Botaliev (see annual report 1999 of the Observatory).  Botaliev, representing the bogus KCHR, said he would pay the compensation.  Afterwards however, the Court asked the execution of the decision to Ramazan Dyryldaev, president of the real KCHR, re-registered since then.  If charged under Article 338, Dyryldaev could face a punishment ranging from a fine of 200 up to 400 minimum monthly salaries, or the deprivation of his rights to hold certain positions, or to pursue certain activities for the term of up to 5 years, or arrest for a term of up to 6 months or imprisonment up to 2 years.    The Observatory believes that this legal proceedings is in fact directed at the activities of KCHR, which has previously been subjected to similar attacks.  (See Annual Report 1999 of the Observatory and the appeal KGZ 001/0005/OBS 036).  This new event comes within the context of the next presidential elections, during which the KCHR is to act as an independent observer.    The Observatory considers these facts to be a part of a concerted policy on the part of the authorities, to constantly harass and place obstacles in the work of legitimate human rights organisations, and this, in flagrant violation of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders adopted by the UN General Assembly in December 1998.  Brief reminder of the situation :  Recently, the Observatory was informed of another legal proceeding against a member of KCHR, Mr. Mambetaipov, who was charged, on May 2nd, 2000, under Article 335 of the Criminal Code, concerning illegal actions towards property.  Mambetaipov is responsible for administrative issues in KCHR, including the maintenance of the property.  He is forbidden to leave Bishkek city and if charged could face a fine of 100 to 200 minimum monthly salaries, or arrest for a term of up to 6 months, or imprisonment for up to two years.   The property in question in fact belongs to Ministry of Agriculture.  KCHR offices are at the Agriculture Ministry where they rent a room as a reception dealing with complaints of individuals.  The furniture, inventoried on March 24th 1999, and used in accordance with the lease agreement Number 21 of January 1, 1999, is, according to KCHR, still in its place.     Action requested:  Please write to the Kyrgyz Authorities demanding that they:  i	immediately drop the charges against Mr Dyryldaev;  ii. 	put an end to all forms of harassment of human rights defenders and their organisations, in particular the current legal proceedings against the KCHR and its members;  iii.	ensure the implementation of the provisions of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 9 1998 (Declaration concerning the rights and responsibilities of individuals, groups and institutions to promote and protect universally recognised human rights and fundamental liberties ) in particular its Article 1 which provides that « Every person has the right, individually or collectively, to promote the protection and fulfilment of human rights and fundamental liberties at the national and international level. »  iv.	guarantee the effective respect of fundamental rights and liberties in accordance with the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the international and regional Pacts and Covenants ratified by Kyrgystan.
