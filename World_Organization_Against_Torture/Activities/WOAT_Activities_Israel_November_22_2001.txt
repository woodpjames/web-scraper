New information  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by a reliable source that 15 year old Sanaa’ Amer was released from Ramle Prison on 5 November 2001. Since towards her sentence was counted the period from the moment of her arrest until her sentencing in July, she was eligible for release on parole on 29 September. Sanaa’ was detained an additional one month and one week because she was apparently supposed to act as a witness at the trial of her sister Abeer. In the end, she didn’t act as a witness.  Brief reminder of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT had been informed by a reliable source that Sanaa’Amer, a Palestinian girl, had been subjected to torture and other forms of ill-treatment during detention and had been excessively sentenced by a military court. OMCT believes she was 14 years old at the time of these events.  She was brutally arrested on 20 February 2001 in Hebron at the same time as her sister Abeer. Saana’ was taken afterwards to an interrogation room where two men dressed in civilian clothes accused her of planning with her sister to stab a settler. One of the men hit her hard enough to cause a bruise on her arm. Since 11 March 2001, Sanaa’ had been detained in Ramle Prison together with seven adults. In early May, Sanaa’ was placed in a room by herself where her arms and legs were tied to her bed from 10 pm until 6 am for two days. At the end of June, Sanaa’ was allegedly beaten with sticks on her arms and legs. Her arms were tied behind her back and she was kicked by the police in the stomach, inducing her to cough up blood. As of 12 July 2001 Sanaa’ had received no medical treatment and felt pain whenever she ate or drank.  Sanaa was tried on 12 July 2001 and sentenced to 1 year in prison with an additional 4 years suspended sentence, if she should commit any offence during the next 5 years.  Remarks  OMCT welcomes the release of Sanaa’ Amer, and wishes to thank all those institutions, organisations and individuals who intervened on her behalf.
