Brief description of the situation The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Task Force Detainees of the Philippines (TFDP), a member of OMCT SOS-Torture network, about the killing of Mr. Vincente T. “Roger” Paglinawan, 51-year-old peasant leader residing in Sitio San Miguel, Malabog, Paquibato District, Davao City, on Mindanao island, on 22 November 2008. According to the information received, on 22 November 2008, at 5:30pm, Mr. Vicente T. Paglinawan was talking to a colleague in a nearby Purok within the vicinity of the Poblacion Malabog when he was shot by an unidentified gunman. This latter was reportedly riding on a motorcycle driven by a man wearing a helmet. According to the information, the gunman alighted from the motorcycle and shot Mr. Vicente T. Paglinawan from about one meter, who reportedly died instantly. While a police outpost is located only three meters away from the scene, the police only allegedly intervened 15 minutes after some residents had reported the incident. According to the same information, two weeks before, two individuals riding a motorcycle had asked on two occasions neighbours of Mr. Vincente T. Paglinawan about the whereabouts of the family. Mr. Vincente T. Paglinawan was the Regional Vice President for Minadanao of Pambansang Kilusan ng mga Samahang Magsasaka (PAKISAMA) (National Federation of Peasant Organizations), a Section Chair of AKBAYAN partylist in Paquibato District, Davao City, a board member of Malabog Integrated Enterprises Development Cooperative, a member of Lupong Tagapamaya and a church lay leader.

Paglinawan, in particular with regard to a pattern of targeted attacks on political activists in the country.
