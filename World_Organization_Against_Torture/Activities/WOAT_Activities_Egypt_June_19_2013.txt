The Court did not find Mr. Hassan Mustafa guilty on the original charges of assault (see background information), and issued the maximum sentence for defamation. The verdict issued by the appeal court is the last legal recourse available. Mr. Mustafa will continue to serve his sentence in Al Gharbaneyat prison. The Observatory expresses its deep concern about the sentencing in appeal of Mr. Hassan Mustafa, which it considers as an attempt to prevent his legitimate and peaceful human rights activities, and calls upon the Egyptian authorities to release Mr. Hassan Mustafa immediately and unconditionally since his detention is arbitrary. Background information: On January 21, 2013, Mr. Mustafa was arrested as he was in the premises of the Prosecutor's Office to request information on the situation and whereabouts of demonstrators arrested two days earlier. On March 12, 2013, he was sentenced to two years' imprisonment by the Mansheya Misdemeanour Court, for allegedly attacking and defaming a member of the Prosecutor's Office. During the hearing, the Court reportedly heard only two defence testimonies out of 15. Mr. Mustafa's lawyer reported in particular that he had witnessed the arrest of his client and denied the fact that the latter had attacked a member of the Prosecutor's Office on that occasion. On the same day, his lawyer appealed the sentencing. Actions requested: Please write to the authorities of Egypt asking them to: i.       Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Hassan Mustafa and all human rights defenders in Egypt; ii. Release Mr. Hassan Mustafa immediately and unconditionally since his detention is arbitrary as it seems to only aim at sanctioning his human rights activities; iii.      Put an end to all acts of harassment, including at the judicial level, against Mr. Hassan Mustafa and all human rights defenders in Egypt; iv.     Comply with all the provisions of the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, in particular with:-       its Article 1, which provides that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”;-       its Article 6 (a) and (b), which provides that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others: To know, seek, obtain, receive and hold information about all human rights and fundamental freedoms, including having access to information as to how those rights and freedoms are given effect in domestic legislative, judicial or administrative systems; and a provided for in human rights and other applicable international instruments, freely to publish, impart or disseminate to others views, information and knowledge on all human rights and fundamental freedoms”; v.    Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by Egypt. Addresses ·         President of the Arab Republic of Egypt, His Excellency Mohammad Morsy, Abedine Palace, Cairo, Egypt, E-mail: webmaster@presidency.gov.eg, Fax: +202 23901998·         Prime Minister Mr. Hisham Kandil, Magles El Shaab Street, Kasr El Aini Street, Cairo, Egypt.
