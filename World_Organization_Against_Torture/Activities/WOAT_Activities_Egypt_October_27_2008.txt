Description of the situation: The Observatory has been informed by the Arab Centre for the Independence of the Judiciary and the Legal Profession (ACIJLP) about death threats against Mr. Nasser Amine, ACIJLP Director General, and Mr. Hammad Wadi Sannd, researcher at ACIJLP. According to the information received, on October 25, 2008, a group referring itself as “the Middle East Mujahedeen in Cairo” sent an email on the official ACIJLP address, threatening to kill Mr. Nasser Amine if he did not desist “his role and the role of the Centre towards Darfur crisis in addition to the role of the International Criminal Court on this crisis”. According to ACIJLP, this primarily refer to the Centre’s advocacy of strengthening criminal justice, particularly the International Criminal Court (ICC), and lobbying for its intervention in Darfur. The email also contained threats against Mr. Hammad Wadi Sannd. The Observatory is deeply concerned by these death treats against Messrs. Nasser Amine and Hammad Wadi Sannd and fears that their motive is to hinder the role played by the ACIJLP in strengthening the international criminal justice and the role of the ICC in resolving the crisis in Darfur.
