New information: The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources, including Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights (ZLHR), of the release of all members of Women of Zimbabwe Arise (WOZA) and Men of Zimbabwe Arise (MOZA) who remained detained at Bulawayo Central Police Station since November 29, 2006. According to the information received they were all released on December 4, 2006 at noon. The Observatory thanks all the persons, organisations and institutions who intervened in favour of their release. However, the Observatory recalls that they remain charged under two separate sections of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act: Chapter 46 section 2 (v) – “employing any means whatsoever which are likely materially to interfere with the ordinary comfort, convenience, peace or quiet of the public, or does any act which is likely create a nuisance or obstruction” and Chapter 37 – ”participating in a public gathering with the intent to cause public disorder, breach of peace or bigotry”. If found guilty, the members could be fined or imprisoned for a period not exceeding six months or both. At the moment, the group cannot be taken to court, as the arresting officers are still refusing to give their statement. Police will allegedly proceed by way of summons. Background information: On November 29, 2006, more than sixty WOZA members and four MOZA members were arrested, as they were marching peacefully through central Bulawayo to the government offices at Mhlanhlandlela, in order to mark the launch of the People’s Charter[1] and the “16 Days of Activism Against Gender Violence”, an international campaign running until International Human Rights Day on December 10, as well as to protest against the Public Order Security Act (POSA). The repression of the march was particularly violent insofar as 30 riot police officers began to assault the peaceful group with baton sticks, forcefully dispersing most of the group, composed of over 200 participants. Many people were beaten, including a young baby. Six members were taken to Mpilo Hospital for medical attention, including one woman whose leg was broken and who was later transferred to a private hospital for treatment. 41 persons were taken to Drill Hall, where they were beaten and harassed by police officers, before being released without charge on the same day. The others, including WOZA leaders Mrs. Jennifer Williams and Mrs. Magodonga Mahlangu, were taken to Bulawayo Central Police Station. Thirty-six members of WOZA and MOZA, including six mothers with babies, spent the night from November 29 to 30, 2006 at Bulawayo Central. Advocate Dube, lawyer for WOZA, was also threatened with arrest for “interfering with the course of justice” whilst trying to attend to her clients. She only managed to see the group on November 30, 2006, in the afternoon. On November 30, 2006, the six mothers with babies were released. As of December 1, 2006, 34 WOZA/ MOZA members remained in police custody, being illegally detained as they have been arrested since over 48 hours. The WOZA and MOZA members, including the six mothers released on November 30, who reported back to the Bulawayo Central Police Station on December 1, 2006, were charged for “employing any means whatsoever which are likely materially to interfere with the ordinary comfort, convenience, peace or quiet of the public, or does any act which is likely create a nuisance or obstruction” and “participating in a public gathering with the intent to cause public disorder, breach of peace or bigotry” (Chapters 46 and 37 of the Criminal Law Act).
