The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme
of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and FIDH, requests your urgent
intervention in the following situation in India. 
 
Description
of the Situation:
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources of the criminalization and
judicial harassment of journalist and “Outlook” Magazine’s Editor-in-Chief and
publisher, Ms. Neha Dixit[1]
as well as other journalists of “Outlook” Magazine, for publishing an
investigation alleging trafficking in June 2015 of at least 31 girls belonging to Bodo and Santhal
communities from Assam, Kokjrajhar district, by organisations
affiliated to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and the Rashtriya
Sevika Samiti [2].                         
 
According to the information received, on August
4, 2016, a police complaint against journalist Neha Dixit and other “Outlook” Magazine journalists was filed at Latasil Police Station in Guwahati
city, Assam, by members of the Bharatiya Janata Party[3]. The
case[4] was
registered under sections 120 (B) (“Punishment of criminal conspiracy”), and
153 (A) (“promoting enmity between different groups
on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc., and
doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony”) of the Indian Penal Code. 
The Observatory strongly
condemns the attempts to criminalize Ms. Neha Dixit as well as the other
“Outlook” journalists, and calls upon the Indian authorities to put an end to the ongoing
judicial harassment against them, as well as against all journalists and human
rights defenders in India. Besides, until all charges against Ms. Neha Dixit and other journalists of “Outlook” are dropped,
the Observatory urges the Indian authorities to ensure that judicial
proceedings against them are carried out in full compliance with their right to
a fair trial, as provided for under international law. 
Actions requested:

them to:

ii.    
Immediately
and unconditionally close the criminal case against Ms. Neha
Dixit and other journalists of “Outlook” Magazine;
 
iii.   
Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological
integrity of Ms. Neha Dixit and other journalists of “Outlook” Magazine, as
well as of all journalists and in India, who merely exercise their right
to freedom of opinion and expression;

on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United
