Brief description of the facts:  The Observatory has been informed by the Sudan Organization Against Torture (SOAT), of the arrest, on 28 December 2003, by the National Security Agency (NSA), of Mr. Madawi Ibrahim Adam, 47 years old, Chairperson of the Sudan Social Development Organisation (SUDO).  According to the information received, Mr. Madawi was arrested at his house, in Omdurman, which was searched and allegedly damaged. Some documents were seized, in particular a project for the development of water stations in South Sudan.  According to the same information, Mr. Madawi was then taken to his office in Khartoum, at Lamda Engineering Company, which was also searched and his computer and other items were confiscated. Mr. Madawi remained in detention at an unknown location and his wife made a request to see him on 30 December 2003. The following day, he was allowed to call his wife briefly to inform her that he was well and requested some clothes. It is reported that Mr. Madawi has not been charged and no reason was given for his arrest. On the 3 January 2004, it was confirmed that he was transferred to Kober Prison.   The Observatory fears that these events are linked with the activities of SUDO, a voluntary organisation created to promote sustainable development and human rights. Indeed, SUDO has been active in Darfur carrying out various workshops on human rights and has provided assistance to Internally Displaced People (IDP's) in Darfur. One day prior to his arrest, Mr. Madawi was conducting a workshop on human rights education in Shendi.   The Observatory recalls that the members of SUDO have already been harassed in the past. In particular, Hussein Ibrahim Gindeel, the executive director of SUDO, had been held incommunicado from 24 to 27 March 2003. This arrest was linked with a workshop he was due to lead on 26 and 27 March in Damazin, dedicated to the role of civil society in the peace process. Permission for the workshop was initially granted by the security forces but subsequently withdrawn, without an official explanation, on 24 March.   Action requested:  Please write to the authorities of Sudan urging them to:  i.	guarantee Mr. Madawi Ibrahim Adam’s physical and psychological integrity and release him immediately, in the absence of any valid charges against him; ii.	conform to the provisions of the Declaration on Humans Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, in particular article 1, which states that "everyone has the right, individually or in association with others, to promote the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels"; article 12.2 which provides that "the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually or in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto o de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration."; iii.	ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards.
