Release / Judicial harassment
Zimbabwe
June 1, 2011
 
The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), has received new information and requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in Zimbabwe.
 
New information:
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the release and judicial harassment faced by Ms. Florence Ndlovu, Regional Coordinator for Matabeleland province of the Zimbabwe Human Rights Association (ZimRights). 
 
According to the information received, on May 27, 2011, Ms. Florence Ndlovu was charged for “communicating false statements prejudicial to the State” under Section 31 (2) (b) of the Criminal Law and Codification Reform Act and released on a bail of 35 Euros after almost a week in detention. The trial was scheduled to start on June 24, 2011.
 
The Observatory welcomes Ms. Florence Ndlovu’s release on bail and thanks all the persons, institutions and organisations who intervened in her favour. However, the Observatory strongly condemns the ongoing judicial harassment against her, and calls upon the Zimbabwean authorities to put an end to such acts of intimidation and harassment as they merely seem to aim at sanctioning her human rights activities.
 
Background Information :
 
On May 23, 2011, Ms. Florence Ndlovu was arbitrarily arrested by the police, together with ZimRights paralegal officer for Matabeleland, Midlands and Masvingo provinces, Mr. Walter Dube, as they were coming out of a workshop in Tsholotsho, Matabeleland North province. This arrest had taken place soon after the police disrupted the workshop, which had been organised by ZimRights to raise villagers’ awareness on torture and its effects. 
 
The two defenders were detained during three days without any access to their lawyers. During the first 48 hours of their detention, the Zimbabwean police even denied holding the two activists. It is only in the late afternoon of May 26, 2011 that the police confirmed their detention at Lupane police station. Later on the same day, Mr. Dube was released without charges, while Ms. Ndlovu was maintained in detention. While in prison, the activists were kept in overcrowded cells, living in precarious sanitary circumstances. 
 
The police alleged that Ms. Ndlovu told villagers who participated in ZimRights workshop that the “police torture and assault people”. However, Ms. Ndlovu denied the allegations and indicated that she only spoke about examples and scenarios of torture.
 
Actions requested:
