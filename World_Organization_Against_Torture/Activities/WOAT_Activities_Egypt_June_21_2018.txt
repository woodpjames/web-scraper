The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a
partnership of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and FIDH, has
received new information and requests your urgent intervention in the following
situation in Egypt.
 
New information:
 
The Observatory has been
informed by reliable sources about the release on bail of Ms. Mozn Hassan, woman human rights
defender, founder and Executive Director of Nazra for Feminist studies[1].
 
According to the information received, on June
20, 2018, Ms. Mozn Hassan was released by the Cairo Court in Fifth Settlement
District upon payment of a 30’000 EGP (approximately 1’450 EUR) bail. However, she is still facing charges
of “establishing an entity in violation of the law”, “conducting activities
that do not abide by the purposes of the organization with the intention of
harming national security”, “receiving foreign funding with the intention of
harming national security” and tax evasion within the framework of case No.
173/2011 also known as the “NGO Foreign Funding case”[2] (see background information). 
 
The Observatory recalls that Ms. Mozn Hassan
was included in case No. 173/2011, which targets numerous civil society
organisations and leaders in Egypt, in March 2016 and that her assets as well
as the assets of her organization were frozen by the North Cairo Elementary
Court on January 11, 2017. Furthermore, Ms. Hassan is subjected to a travel ban
since June 2016.
 
The Observatory strongly
condemns the ongoing judicial harassment against Ms. Mozn Hassan, which only
aims at silencing her peaceful and legitimate activities in defense of women rights.
The Observatory is particularly concerned as Ms. Mozn Hassan’s summoning and
detention come amidst a renewed crackdown on civil society in Egypt, in which
three human rights defenders have already been arrested since May 11, 2018[3].
 
The Observatory urges the Egyptian
authorities to put an end to all forms of harassment, including at the judicial
level, against Ms. Mozn Hassan and all human rights defenders in Egypt. The
Observatory further urges the Egyptian authorities to lift the travel ban to
which Ms. Mozn Hassan is currently subjected.
 
Background information:
 
Since 2011, the Egyptian Government has
launched a judicial harassment campaign against civil society organisations on
the pretext that they received unauthorised foreign funding under criminal case
No. 173/2011, known as the “NGO Foreign Funding case”.
 
The 2011 Government Fact-Finding Committee
report, which formed the basis of the first trial in 2012, listed 37 NGOs who
could be targeted under this “foreign funding case against NGOs”. That list
included ACIJLP, CIHRS, LCHR, the Egyptian Democratic Academy (EDA), HMLC,
ANHRI, EIPR, El Nadim Center for the Management and Rehabilitation of Victims
of Violence and Torture, the Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights
(ECESR), the Arab Penal Reform Organization, the Egyptian Center for the Right
to Education, El-Haq, the Egyptian Association for Community Participation
Enhancement (ACPE), Nazra for Feminist Studies, the Appropriate Communications
Technologies (ACT), among others.
 
On March 22, 2016, Ms. Mozn Hassan was
summoned to appear before New Cairo Court in relation to criminal case No.
173/2011, together with two other members of her association. On March 29,
2016, the judge notified their lawyers that he would have specified an
appointment for them to review the case papers and that he would then have
summoned Ms. Hassan for another day. 
 
On June 27, 2016 Ms. Mozn Hassan was informed
by authorities at the Cairo International Airport that a travel ban had been
imposed on her, under the framework of the “NGO Foreign Funding Case”. Ms. Mozn
Hassan had attempted to travel to participate in the Executive Committee
meeting of the Women Human Right Defenders (WHRD) Regional Coalition for the
Middle East and North Africa, taking place during the period of June 27 to July
1, 2016.
 
On December 12, 2016, the investigative judge
requested the North Cairo Court to freeze the assets of Ms. Mozn Hassan,
Founder and Executive Director of Nazra for Feminist Studies, as well as the
assets of her organisations. On January 11, 2017 the North Cairo Elementary
Court accepted his request and froze Ms. Hassan’s personal assets and those of
her association.
 
On June 18, 2018, Ms. Mozn Hassan was summoned by the investigative
judge of the Cairo Court in Fifth Settlement District, in relation with
criminal case No. 173/2011 on Foreign Funding.
