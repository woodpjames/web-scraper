Brief description:  The Observatory has received information from the Bangladesh Human Rights Commission (BHRC) that Md. Nazrul Islam Delwar, a permanent member of the BHRC, has been falsely charged in connection with the killing of a robber in the village of Khaisair of Rupgonj Thana of the Narayangonj district.   According to the information received, a case was filed for the killing, by villagers who caught him, of a robber, Rabbani,.  The case was filed at Rupgonj Thana, No. 37(3)99 dated 29/3/99 under section 143/323/324/302/34/114 Bangladesh Panel Court.  In the first Information Report, the name of Nazrul Islam was not present, however the last inquiry officer, sub-inspector Mr Rahiz Uddin reportedly included his name as the instigator and charged him along with the others involved in this killing.  An enquiry by the BHRC could not find a link between Nazrul Islam and the death of Rabbani and noted that in fact he resides in Dhaka.  Furthermore, it was noted that Mr Nazrul Islam contested the last Union Parishad (UP) election (Primary body of local Government ) against the present Chairman Mr Mafazzal Haque Pinto, who claims to be a member of the Government Party Awami League, and in doing so protested against many unjust and repressive acts by the Chairman.  A connection between the UP Chairman and a local ‘terrorist’ leader, Mr Joinal, was also highlighted by BHRC.  Mr Nazrul Islam recently assisted a freedom fighter, Mr Eliyas, and protected him and his family, against Mr Joinal in the Rupgonj Thana case No.10(1)98 under section 143/448/323/354/379/380/506 of BPC and case no. 5(1)98 under section 435 BPC.  BHRC has appealed to the Prime Minister, Home Minister, Home Secretary, Inspector General of Police for re-enquiry but it is reported that no action has been taken to date.   The Observatory believes that the charges against Nazrul Islam Delwar are arbitrary and are directed at his activities as a human rights defender.   Action Requested :  Please write to the authorities of Bangladesh, urging them to :  i. 	adopt appropriate measures to drop all charges against Mr Nazrul Islam;  ii.	ensure the implementation of the provisions of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 9 1998 in particular its Article 1 which provides that " Every person has the right, individually or collectively, to promote the protection and fulfilment of human rights and fundamental liberties at the national and international level ".  iii.	more generally guarantee the effective respect of fundamental human rights and freedoms in accordance with the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
