New information: The Observatory has been informed by the Task Force Detainees of the Philippines (TFDP) that Mr. Norbeto Murillo, a technical consultant for the farmers’ organisation Life and Food for Leyte Evacuees (LFLE)[1], who had disappeared on October 29, 2008, was found to be detained at the Manila City Jail. According to the information received, on October 31, 2008, Major Libay of the Task Force Usig of the Philippine National Police (PNP) confirmed that Mr. Norbeto Murillo had been brought and detained at the Custodial Centre, Camp Crame, in Quezon City. On November 1, 2008, the Families of Victims of Involuntary Disappearance (FIND) and Mrs. Violeta Murillo, the wife of Mr. Norbeto Murillo, visited him in Camp Crame. Based on Mr. Murillo’s account, right after he was arrested inside the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) compound (See background information), he was immediately blindfolded and was brought to a “safe house” of the PNP. There, he was interrogated about his involvement with the progressive movement, and his alleged participation in the multiple murder case that was filed against Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) Chairperson Jose Maria Sison and several co-accused, in relation to the communist purges that occurred during the late 1980s in Samar, Leyte. Mr. Murillo said that the interrogation lasted for several hours depriving him of much needed sleep. Also during the interrogation, his abductors threatened to physically torture him if he does not cooperate with them. Around 9:00 am on November 1, 2008, Mr. Murillo was brought to Caloocan City Hall extension in Novaliches, Quezon City, where the interrogation continued. After an hour, he was then brought to Manila City Hall by his captors where he signed a document in front of a person introduced to him as a prosecutor. On November 3, 2008, Mr. Murillo was transferred to the Manila City Jail, where he is currently detained. A arrest warrant against Mr. Murillo was issued by the Manila Regional Trial Court Branch 32. Mr. Murillo was an active member of the progressive movement during the 80’s and early 90’s but has since left the mainstream to work with farmers organizations as a technical consultant assisting them with their land issues. The Observatory expresses its deep concern with Mr. Noberto Murillo’s arbitrary detention, which constitutes a further evidence of the increased repression against human rights defenders in the Philippines, and recalls that the Philippines has been elected as a member of the Human Rights Council until 2010 and has, in this regard, committed to “uphold the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights”[2]. Accordingly, the Observatory urges the Philippines to comply with Article 12.2 of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 9, 1998, which states that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any threats, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”. Background information: On October 29, 2008 in the morning, Mr. Noberto Murillo was abducted by three men, who reportedly identified themselves as operatives of the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG), outside the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) building. Mr. Murillo was abducted after having held a meeting at the DAR to follow up on the documents regarding a LFLE land claim for alienable and disposal land in Leyte. According to Mr. Paulo Dellosa, LFLE Chairperson, the three men showed Mr. Murillo a warrant of arrest and introduced themselves as CIDG operatives after which they forcibly dragged him to a waiting FX vehicle. There were reportedly around 10 alleged CIDG operatives including intelligence agents who entered the DAR compound an hour before Mr. Murillo and Mr. Dellosa arrived, according to the security officer assigned on that day. It was also learned that a Toyota Revo was used in the abduction and carries a plate number XKN 290. The security guard also spotted some AUVs and motorcycles used by the operatives aside from the Revo. On October 30, 2008, the Families of Victims of Involuntary Disappearance (FIND) accompanied Mrs. Violeta Murillo to the Commission on Human Rights (CHR) to report the incident. Actions required: Please write to the authorities of the Philippines urging them to:   Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Noberto Murillo and of all human rights defenders in the Philippines;  Ensure his immediate release since his detention is arbitrary as it merely aims at sanctioning his human rights activities;  End all forms of harassment, including judicial harassment, again human rights defenders in the Philippines, and guarantee in all circumstances that they be able to carry out their work without any hindrance;  Conform with all the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, especially its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels” and above-mentioned Article 12.2;  More generally, ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by the Philippines.
