Brief description of the situation: The Observatory has been informed by the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights (BCHR) of the abduction and attack suffered by Mr. Jaafar Kadhim, who works for the Committee of Activists and Prisoners of Conscience. According to the information received, on May 7, 2009 at 8.45 pm, while Mr. Jaafar Kadhim was driving close to the Jidhafs Medical Centre, west of the capital Manama, his car was stopped by two cars, and he was pulled from his car, his eyes were blind folded and he was taken for a 10-15 minutes by five or six men in plain clothes drive to an unknown area where he was severely beaten until he lost consciousness. He regained consciousness in his car, covered in his blood. He managed to find his way to the nearby house of a friend, from where he was transferred to the hospital by ambulance. He was visited the next day by the police and the Public Prosecutor’s Office. Bahraini press coverage of Mr. Jaafar Kadhim’s abuse has been limited to one article in the Al Wasat independent newspaper published on May 9, in which a spokesperson for the Director of the Northern Governorate Police stated that Mr. Jaafar Kadhim was a victim of robbery. Mr. Jaafar Kadhim has worked for the Committee of Activists and Prisoners of Conscience since December 2007 and has helped to organise peaceful marches and protests for the rights of detainees. During 2007-2008, he hosted meetings for relatives of detainees with many visiting foreign journalist and international human rights organisations, including an Amnesty International delegation. Following these activities, he was arbitrarily arrested on February 4, 2009 by security forces and released, without charges, on February 9, 2009. Since his release, Mr. Jaafar Kadhim has helped BCHR and Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights (BYSHR) in documenting recent cases of torture and assisting families of 19 detainees, who have remained in prison despite the royal pardon issued on April 12, 2009, which allowed the release of 178 activists, including several human rights defenders. Mr. Jaafar Kadhim is currently at Salmania Public Hospital where he is being treated for severe injuries in the head, the face and the back. The Observatory is extremely concerned by the attack suffered by Mr. Jaafar Kadhim. The Observatory fears that Mr. Jaafar Kadhim was subjected to this attack because of his human rights activities, especially the rights of detainees and the documentation of torture cases. The Observatory urges the Bahraini authorities to carry out an immediate, thorough and impartial investigation into all the above-mentioned facts, in order to identify those responsible for the assault, and bring them in the shortest delays before a competent and impartial tribunal.
