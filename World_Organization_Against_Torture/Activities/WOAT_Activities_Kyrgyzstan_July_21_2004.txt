New Information:  The Observatory has been informed of new acts of aggression against the family of Mr. Ramazan Dyryldaev, the Chairman of the Kyrgyz Committee for Human Rights (KCHR).  According to the information received, Mrs. Aitbaeva Ainura, the daughter of Mr. Dyryldaev, was attacked at her home on the evening of July 3, 2004.  Unknown persons broke into her home while she was there with her two children.  She was violently beaten to the point of unconsciousness and was admitted to the hospital with a concussion.  It is not likely that the perpetrators were petty criminals since nothing was stolen from the house.  Rather, the Observatory fears that this attack against Mrs. Ainura may be linked with her father’s human rights activities.    Background Information: After serving for five years as the Chairman of the KCHR, Mr. Dyryldaev was again elected as chairman on May 11, 2003 by the active members of KCHR.  On August 25, 2003, three former members of KCHR, Mssrs. Tynaliev, Mombekov, and Jakishev announced in a press conference that they were dismissing Mr. Dyryldaev as chairman and instituting Mr. Tynaliev in his place. No acting members or board members of KCHR participated in this decision or this conference.  Despite the official government registration of KCHR with Mssrs. Tynaliev, Jakishev and Bulatov as the executive body, human rights organizations such as the Helsinki Federation for Human Rights, as well as FIDH and OMCT, have refused to recognize this new leadership.  Active members of the original KCHR have long endured threats, harassment and a campaign of defamation which have increased since the recreation of KCHR under new leadership.  Mr. Dyryldaev has been the subject of accusations of mismanagement of funds and corruption, as well as demands that he turn over all his property to the new KCHR administration. Following confirmation from security services that there was an order to assassinate Mr. Dyryldaev, he has taken permanent refuge in Vienna since May 2003 (see Observatory Annual Report 2003).    Action requested :  Please write Kyrgyz authorities urging them to:  i.	guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of Mrs. Aibaeva Ainura and her family;  ii.	carry out an independent and impartial investigation into the attack in order to identify those responsible, bring them to trial and apply penal, civil and/or administration sanctions as provided by law;  iii.	put an immediate end to all threats and harassment of Kyrgyz human rights defenders or their families;  iv.	conform with the provisions of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 9, 1998, in particular its article 1 which provides that “every person has the right, individually or collectively, to promote the protection and fulfilment of human rights and fundamental liberties at the national and international level.”   Addresses: Mr Askar Akayev, President of the Kyrgyz Republic, Kyrgyzskaya  Respublika, 720003 g.
