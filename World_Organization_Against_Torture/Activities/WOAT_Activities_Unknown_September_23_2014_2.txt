Joint statement OMCT and DCI
Distinguished
delegates and panelists,
The World Organisation Against Torture and Defence for Children
International welcome the initiative of a panel discussion on the ways and
means to end violence against children. We believe that this event is a
positive contribution to the fight against torture, inhuman and degrading
treatment.
On this occasion we would like to express our concern about several
issues.
Regarding children deprived of liberty, we would like to recall that
they are at higher risk of violence than many other children. Because of the
setting they are in, children deprived of liberty are highly vulnerable to
physical, psychological and sexual violence.
Therefore, we would like to emphasize the importance for States to
establish effective and independent complaint mechanisms to deal with cases of
violence involving children deprived of liberty. Complaint systems should lead
to an effective investigation of possible abuses committed either during the
arrest or during the detention.
It is then imperative to ensure that children in detention are aware of
their rights and can access the mechanisms in place to protect them.
Moreover, there is a need to ensure effective monitoring and regular
access to justice institutions by independent bodies empowered to conduct
unannounced visits and interviews with children and staff, and to investigate
allegations of violence.
Finally, we encourage States to mainstream the concern of children
deprived of liberty and to call for the inclusion of a child protection goal in
the post-2015 development agenda.
Thank you.
