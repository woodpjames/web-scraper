The Observatory for the
Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the World
Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and the International Federation for Human
Rights (FIDH), requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in Zimbabwe.
 
Description of
the situation:
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the raid
into the Counselling Services Unit (CSU), a lawfully registered
medical clinic providing non-partisan counselling and referral to all victims
of trauma, and the subsequent arbitrary detention of
three of its staff members.
 
According to the
information received, on November 5, 2012 around lunch time, 12
uniformed and non-uniformed police officers, including members of the Bomb
Disposal Squad and an Information Technology expert, raided the CSU offices in
Harare. The clinic was surrounded by armed riot police, who
threatened to fire tear gas into the building, which is also occupied by other
tenants. The police were in possession of a search warrant justifying the raid as
aimed to recover material that “defaces any house, building, wall, fence, lamp
post, gate, elevator without the consent of the owner or occupier” and in
contravention of Section 46 of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act.
 
After four hours of
searching during which the police forcibly accessed
confidential medical records, five staff members, Messrs. Fidelis Mudimu, Zachariah
Godi, James Zidzimu, Tafadzwa Geza and Penn Bruno, were arrested for further questioning and taken into
custody at Harare Central Police Station. Some files, a computer that
contains confidential client information and client records, and two cans of spray
paint CSU keeps in the office to mark all their assets were taken as evidence.
Two hours later, at about 6 pm, Messrs. James Zidzimu and Penn Bruno were
released without charge, while Messrs. Fidelis Mudimu,
Zachariah Godi and Tafadzwa Geza remained detained with no
indication of charges.
 
On November 7, 2012,
Messrs. Fidelis Mudimu, Zachariah Godi and Tafadzwa Geza were transferred to Bulawayo
Central Police Station after the required time for a court appearance, and
further detained with no defined charges on a new detention order, written in
Harare and signed in Bulawayo. They were transported on the back of an open
pick up truck, with no protection from the sun, despite the temperature
reaching 33 degrees in Harare. They were not interviewed by the police, but
immediately detained in the police cells.
 
On November 8, 2012, the three were
given bail of USD 100 each and remanded to December 6, 2012.
 
The Observatory expresses its deep
concern about Messrs. Fidelis Mudimu, Zachariah Godi
and Tafadzwa Geza’s arbitrary detention, which seems to only aim at sanctioning
their human rights activities, and calls upon the authorities of Zimbabwe to
release them immediately and unconditionally.
 
Actions
requested:
 
Please write to the
authorities of Zimbabwe asking them to:
 
i.      Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity

which provides that the State shall “take all necessary measures to ensure the

consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of his or her rights”;
