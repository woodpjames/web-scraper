The International Secretariat of the World
Organisation Against Torture (OMCT)
requests your URGENT intervention in the following situation in the People’s Republic of China. 
Brief description of the situation
TheInternational
Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by The Tibetan Centre for Human Rights
and Democracy (TCHRD), a member of OMCT SOS-Torture Network, about the enforced
disappearance of Lobsang Tsering, a
21-year-old monk from Kirti Monastery in Ngaba (Chinese: Aba) Prefecture,
Sichuan Province. 
According to the information received, on 26 June
2012, Lobsang Tsering, originally from Bato village, was arrested at Kirti
Monastery by Public Security Bureau (PSB) officers from Ngaba Prefecture and
taken to an unknown location. His family and relatives reportedly approached
relevant security offices in the region inquiring about his whereabouts and
fate but to no avail. The reason for his arrest also remains unclear. 
The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely
concerned about the safety of Lobsang Tsering, as his whereabouts and fate remain unknown. OMCT urges the competent
authorities to guarantee his physical and psychological integrity at all times,
in accordance with international human rights law, in particular the
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
Punishment, and to immediately locate and
disclose his whereabouts. 
OMCT further calls on the competent authorities to order his immediate
release in the absence of valid legal charges that are consistent with international law and
standards, or, if such charges exist, bring him promptly before an impartial,
independent and competent tribunal and guarantee his procedural rights at all
times, including immediate and unconditional access to a lawyer of his choice.
