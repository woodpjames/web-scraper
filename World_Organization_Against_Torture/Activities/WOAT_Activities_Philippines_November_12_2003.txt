Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Task Force Detainees of the Philippines (TFDP), a member of the OMCT network, of the extrajudicial killings of two youths by army soldiers in Sitio Doqa Aniceta, Barangay San Roque, Catarman Samar, in the Philippines.  According to Mr. Nestor Corong Sr, the victims' father, who witnessed the killings, Mitchie Boy Vega Corong (16 years old) and Nestor Vega Corong, Jr.(13 years old) were shot dead by units of  the PA/CAA 803rd Infantry led by Major Dominggo B. Gobway in Catarman, Samar.   Background Information  According to the information received, on October 19, 2003 at around 3:00 am, Mr. Nestor Corong Sr, a fisherman and his two sons were on the way home after fishing. A few meters away from the shoreline, crossing the road, they were shot at. The two boys died instantly. The father was not hit and shouted for help.      An armed man, later identified as Major Domingo Gobway, asked, "Who are you?" Nestor Sr. responded that they were fishermen heading home and asked him why the soldiers fired at them. According to the information received, Major Domingo Gobway did not reply and appeared to be drunk.  About one to two hours later, two police officers from the Barangay Police Station and a Barangay Councillor came to the incident place. When they arrived, three armed men, in civil clothes suddenly appeared and introduced themselves as members of Major Domingo Gobway's unit. They claimed that the boys were hit during cross-fire with members of the Waray-Waray Gang of suspected criminals. The local police report, signed by the Police Senior Inspector Antonio Villareal Artuz, stated the same.  The army claimed that the two teenage boys were members of that gang.  Nestor Sr stated that there was no such encounter and that the three were merely returning home from fishing.  Reportedly, the army unit was ordered to conduct an operation in Metro Manila, but it was operating in Sitio Doqa Aniceta, Barangay San Roque, Catarman Samar. Senior Inspector Artuz is reported to have stated in an interview that the military unit was out of its jurisdiction. The unit also did not inform the local police that it was in pursuit of suspected criminals.  OMCT recalls that the Philippines is a state party to the Convention on the rights of the child which ensures that "every child has the inherent right to life." (Art.6(1)). The Philippines is also party to the International Covenant On Civil and Political Rights which states at Art. 6 (1), that “no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his life”.   OMCT is gravely concerned about the large number of gross human rights violations that have been noted in the Philippines and urges that this matter be investigated immediately by an impartial panel. Further, the perpetrators should be brought to justice and punished. We also call upon the government of the Philippines to develop strict guidelines to fully ensure the safety of civilians (especially children) during any military or police action.   Action requested  Please write to the authorities in the Philippines urging them to:  i.   order a thorough and impartial investigation into the circumstances of these events,  in order to bring the responsible to trial and apply the penal and/or administrative sanctions as provided by law; ii.   provide a compensation to the victim’s family; iii.  develop guidelines to fully ensure the safety of civilian people during any military or police action; iv. guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
