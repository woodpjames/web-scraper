New information: The Observatory has been informed by the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel (PCATI) of the release from administrative detention of Mr. Hassan Mustafa Zaga, one of PCATI fieldworker, on November 15, 2006. Mr. Zaga was held in administrative detention for nearly 10 months. Mr. Hassan Mustafa Zaga, also the legal coordinator for the northern West Bank of the Palestinian organisation “Ansar Asajeen”, which provides legal aid to Palestinian prisoners, had been arrested on January 11, 2006 by the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF). Since then, Mr. Zaga had been held at the Ketziot Detention Centre for “endangering the security of the region”, without being informed of the grounds for his detention (See background information). On September 13, 2006, a third administrative detention order was issued against him for an additional four months. However, on September 20, 2006, at the end of a hearing on the extension of Mr. Zaga’s administrative detention, the judge of the Ofer Military Court decided on a “substantive” reduction of his administrative detention to a period of two months, as the General Security Service (GSS) seemed to have no new evidence on which to base this extension. As a consequence, Mr. Zaga was due to be released on November 15, 2006. The fact that Mr. Zaga’s detention was “substantively” reduced meant that an additional administrative detention order could not be imposed against Mr. Zaga on the basis of existing evidence. The Observatory welcomes the release of Mr. Hassan Mustafa Zaga, and thanks all the persons, institutions and organisations who intervened in his favour. Background information: On January 11, 2006, Mr. Hassan Mustafa Zaga was arrested by the IDF at a checkpoint between Nablus and Tul Karem in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, and taken to the Hawarah military detention centre near Nablus. During a meeting with his lawyer, Mr. Zaga stated that he had been beaten by IDF agents at the time of his arrest. As a field researcher, Mr. Zaga collected medical information for PCATI and investigated into complaints of human rights violations perpetrated by Israeli security forces against Palestinians. On January 17, 2006, a six-month detention order was issued against him by the IDF Regional Commander, for “endangering the security of the region”. In a letter dated January 23, 2006, the IDF military Prosecutor justified Mr. Zaga’s administrative detention because of “his membership in Hamas, his international activism and the funding of various Hamas activities in the city of Nablus and its surroundings”. The prosecutor stressed that he could not reveal the evidence supporting these charges. On February 2, 2006, the Ofer Military Court confirmed Mr. Zaga’s administrative detention, but reduced it to four months’ detention, which was then due to end on May 17, 2006. On May 22, 2006, the Ketziot Military Court upheld the decision, issued by the GSS, to extend the administrative detention of Mr. Zaga for an additional four months. This second administrative detention order was also based on the fact that Mr. Zaga would “endanger the security of the region”. Mr. Zaga was not given the opportunity to deny or refute the charges brought against him. Attorneys Habib Labib and Eliahu Abram submitted a petition to the High Court of Justice against Mr. Zaga’s second administrative detention order. The petition was based, among other things, on the fact that Mr. Zaga was not interrogated at all and was not given the opportunity to respond to any charges brought against him. This petition led to a police interrogation of Mr. Zaga on the eve of the scheduled hearing at the High Court of Justice on August 21, 2006. In the statement given by Mr. Zaga to the police, he detailed his work in the field of human rights and denied belonging to the Hamas or taking part in its activities. The petition was withdrawn on the recommendation of the High Court of Justice after the judges saw the “confidential evidence” from the GSS against Mr. Zaga. Action requested: Please write to the authorities in Israel, urging them to :  guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Hassan Mustafa Zaga, as well as of all Israeli and Palestinian human rights defenders; put an immediate end to any kind of harassment against all human rights defenders; comply with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, in particular its article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, and article 12(2), which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually or in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”; more generally, ensure in all circumstances the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms throughout the country and the Occupied Palestinian Territories in accordance with international human rights instruments ratified by Israel, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the UN Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.
