The
 E-bulletin on the 59th session of the Committee Against
Torture, which took place from 7 November to 7 December 2016, is
out. During this session, the Committee considered the State reports
submitted by Ecuador, Finland, Monaco, Sri Lanka, Namibia, Turkmenistan and
Armenia. It also reviewed Cape Verde even though the State had not submitted
its initial report, which was already due in 1993. It is available in English
and will shortly be published in French, Spanish and Arabic.
