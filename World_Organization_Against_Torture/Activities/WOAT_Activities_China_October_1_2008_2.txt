Brief description of the situation The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by The Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy (TCHRD), a member of OMCT SOS-Torture network, about the enforced disappearance of five monks from Ramoche Temple, namely 39-year-old Mr. Sonam Rabgyal, native of Markham County, Chamdo Prefecture, “Tibet Autonomous Region” (TAR), and former Chanzoe (manager and treasurer), Damdul, Rabgyal, and two other monks (whose names are currently unknown), since their arrest during a midnight raid in the monks’ residence on 7 April 2008. According to the information received, on 7 April 2008, around 70 monks of Ramoche Temple, which is located to the north of Lhasa city, were detained after the Public Security Bureau (PSB) and People's Armed Police (PAP) forces carried out a midnight raid in the monks’ residences. Whilst most of them were released few days later after having been interrogated, the whereabouts of Mr. Sonam Rabgyal, Damdul, Rabgyal and two other monks remain unclear. According to the same information, before the major protests that broke out in and around Lhasa city on 10 March Tibetan Uprising anniversary, Mr. Sonam Rabgyal, Damdul, Rabgyal and the two other monks had initiated long life prayer offerings to the Dalai Lama, recited prayer offering and had urged for a quick resolution to the Tibet issue during the annual Great Prayer Festival called Monlam Chenmo on the eight’s day of the Tibetan New Year (which corresponded to 14 February this year), following which they reportedly came under scrutiny and were interrogated at length by a work team of the “Patriotic re-education” [1] campaign, who were stationed inside the monastery. The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned for the safety of Mr. Sonam Rabgyal, Damdul, Rabgyal and the two other monks as their whereabouts remain unknown, giving rise to fears that they may be subjected to ill-treatment, torture or potentially extra-judicial execution. OMCT calls on the authorities to immediately locate their whereabouts and guarantee their personal integrity at all times. OMCT recalls that China is a State party to the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment which prohibits torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. OMCT urges the authorities to conform with China’s international human rights obligations, commitments that were reaffirmed on the occasion of its election as a member of the new United Nations Human Rights Council. Actions Requested Please write to the authorities in the People’s Republic of China urging them to:   Immediately locate the whereabouts of Mr. Sonam Rabgyal, Damdul, Rabgyal and the two other monks, as well as guarantee, in all circumstances, their physical and psychological integrity;  Guarantee immediate and unconditional access to legal representation, their families and any medical treatment they may require;  Order their immediate release in the absence of valid legal charges that are consistent with international law and standards, or, if such charges exist, bring them before an impartial, independent, competent and fair tribunal and guarantee their procedural rights at all times;  Order a thorough and impartial investigation into these events in order to identify all those responsible, bring them to trial and apply the penal and/or administrative sanctions as provided by law;  Guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
