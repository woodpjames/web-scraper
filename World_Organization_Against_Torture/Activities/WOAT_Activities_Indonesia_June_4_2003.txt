Brief description of the situation:  The Observatory has been informed by the Asian Human Rights Commission (AHRC) that two well known Indonesian human rights organisations, the National Human Rights Commission of Indonesia (Komnas HAM) and the Commission for Missing Persons and Victims of Violence (KONTRAS) have been targeted by militia groups in separate violent attacks. Moreover, the Observatory has also been informed of the disappearance of Mr. Abdussalam Muhamad Deli and the murder of Mr. Raja Ismail, two Human Rights activists in East Aceh.  According to the information received, on the 20th of May, 1000 civilian militias arrived at the headquarters of Komnas HAM to threaten them with violence if the investigation into the 1965 massacre continued. Indeed, during the 1965 massacre, the Suharto Government is thought to have been responsible for the extermination of an estimated 1 million unarmed civilians, the political imprisonment and torture of 200,000 political opponents and the life-long exclusion and discrimination of anyone with suspected links to Communism. Nothing has as yet been done by the authorities concerning this massacre. The investigation team of Komnas HAM was to present its first report on May 15th, which has since been rescheduled for 6th June.   Furthermore, according to the information received, on May 26th, during the commemoration of the International Week of the Disappeared, about 30 people from the Pemuda Panca Marga (PPM, The Youth of the Veterans) with paramilitary uniforms, demonstrated in front of the office of KONTRAS. They attacked KONTRAS, and in particular its founder Mr. Munir, for their criticism against the Indonesian government’s policy in handling the Aceh problem. They accused KONTRAS’ members of being foreign agents and selling human rights. Then, the PPM left the KONTRAS office, but locked and sealed the entrance gate in the name of the state.   On May 27th, 150 PPM members, attacked the same office once again while KONTRAS was conducting a press conference in relation to the International Week of the Disappeared. They insulted three officers and personnel by forcing them to sing the national anthem and mocking them as pseudo-nationalists when they refused to sing it. Worse still, they physically assaulted them resulting in physical injuries and eventual hospitalisation. Furthermore, these people entered into the office premises and violently destroyed office equipment and paraphernalia. The PPI members left and then went to the office of the PBHI (the Association of Law and Human Rights Advocates). They wounded one of the PBHI’s staff members, who succeeded in forcing the assailants to leave.  	During these attacks, the police were present, but did not intervene. Later the police said that the group of persons was too large to control. Three members of KONTRAS were wounded in the attack. KONTRAS is filing a case concerning this attack. The Observatory recalls that the previous office of KONTRAS was raided in March 2002 by members of the Indonesian military (for further information, see Observatory Appeal IDN 001/0302/OBS 020). The Observatory is concerned that these attacks signal the continued involvement of civilian militias and paramilitary groups in Indonesian politics and consider that the attacks against the offices of Komnas HAM and KONTRAS are part of a pattern of intimidation of human rights defenders and organisations in Indonesia.  	Finally, the AHRC has informed the Observatory that Mr. Abdussalam Muhamad Deli, a 23 year old volunteer of the PB-HAM East Aceh (Human Rights and Legal Aid Post), an NGO that carries out advocacy through data collection, campaigning and legal assistance, has reportedly been missing since May 11th. He was travelling from Central Langsa on a small public bus to visit his family's village. The bus was stopped by unknown men in civilian clothing on the main road between Banda Aceh and Medan. They forced him out of the bus into a “Kijang” car with dark windows and drove away in the direction of the city of Langsa. Volunteers from PB-HAM East Aceh have asked about Abdussalam's whereabouts to the police and authorities of East Aceh.  On the same day, Mr. Raja Ismail, a 50-year-old volunteer of PB-HAM East Aceh, was reportedly abducted outside Langsa. According to the information received, Mr. Ismail left his house in Kuala Simpang, Aceh Tamiang district to bring some data on victims of violence to the office of PB-HAM in Langsa. On the night of May 11th, he had still not returned to his house. On May 13th, his body was found in the Titi Kembar River in Langsa Lama village, East Aceh district. The corpse showed signs of strangling, had knife wounds and bruises.   The Observatory expresses its support to the Indonesian Human Rights associations and condemns these acts and threats of violence that are aimed at dissuading the human rights defenders from carrying out their activities. More generally, the Observatory is gravely concerned by the current crisis in Aceh, in which human rights defenders are prevented from carrying out any activities without facing potentially fatal risks.
