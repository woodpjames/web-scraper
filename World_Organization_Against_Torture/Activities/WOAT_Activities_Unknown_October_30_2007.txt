New information: The Observatory has been informed by the Iranian League for the Defence of Human Rights (LDDHI) of long-term interference in the freedom of movement of Mr. Abdolfattah Soltani, a lawyer at the Bar of Tehran and a founding member of the Defenders of Human Rights Centre (DHRC). According to the information received, although Mr. Soltani was acquitted on May 28, 2007 of all charges that were pending against him since July 2005 (See background information), the Iranian authorities have since then not yet returned his identity documents (i.e. passport and family record book), thus preventing him from exercising his freedom of movement, in violation of Article 12.2 of the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In this regard, the Observatory deplores the fact that Mr. Soltani, who had been officially invited by FIDH to come to France from October 25 to 31, 2007, in order to take part in a conference on “Freedom of expression in Iran” that was held at Sorbonne university on October 27, 2007, has been unable to travel. The Observatory expresses its deep concern with what it considers as one more form of harassment of the Iranian authorities against a long-standing human rights defender, and wishes to insist on the fact that Iran had committed to “uphold the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights”[1] by presenting its candidacy to the Human Rights Council 2006 election and had insisted in this regard on the fact that the country had “continuously put great efforts into safeguarding the status and inherent dignity of the human person as well as the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms”[2]. In order to ensure the continuation of these efforts, the Observatory urges the Islamic Republic of Iran to conform with international human rights standards. Background information: Mr. Soltani had been arrested on July 30, 2005, while taking part in a sit-in at the Tehran Bar to protest against an arrest warrant issued against him by the Public Prosecutor for “espionage”. On March 6, 2006, Mr. Soltani had been released after a bail of 100,000 euros had been paid, thanks to a national and international movement of solidarity. On July 16, 2006, he was informed that the Revolutionary Court had sentenced him to five years’ imprisonment and the loss of his civic rights for “non-respect of the confidentiality of the preliminary enquiry”, in a trial in which Mr. Soltani appeared for the family of the victim, and during which he had questioned the independence of justice. Mr. Soltani had appealed the decision. Actions requested: Please write to the Iranian authorities and ask them to:  Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Abdolfattah Soltani and all human rights defenders in Iran; Put an immediate end to any kind of hindrance on Mr. Soltani’s freedom of movement, by returning him all his personal documents, including travel documents; Put an end to acts of harassment against all human rights defenders in Iran; Conform in any circumstances with the provisions of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted on December 9, 1998 by the United Nations General Assembly, in particular its article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually or in association with others, to promote the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, its article 5(c), which reads that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, at the national and international levels, [...] to communicate with non-governmental or intergovernmental organizations”, and its article 12.2 which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”; Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by Iran.
