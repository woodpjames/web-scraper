Brief description of the situation: The Observatory has been informed by several reliable sources of the closure of the Naj-Hamadi branch and the Mahalla branch of the Centre for Trade Union and Workers Services (CTUWS). On March 29, 2007 the Naj-Hamadi branch of the CTUWS located in the Qena governorate, in Upper Egypt, was shut down by Administrative Decision No. 44 issued by the Chairman of the City, General Al Sherbeery Hasheesh. In particular, the government called for the discontinuance of the Naj-Hamadi branch citing that it was responsible for disruptive demonstrations and inciting strikes that took place in the Delta region of the country during the months of December 2006 and January 2007. Yet, although some demonstrators were CTUWS members, there is no evidence that the CTUWS did organise these strikes. Furthermore, on April 10, 2007, the governor of El-Gharbiya issued a decision to shut down the CTUWS branch in Mahalla city. Over the past few months, the CTUWS was the target of a smear campaign headed by the Egyptian Trade Union Federation (ETUF) that consistently accused CTUWS of inciting workers’ strikes. These events took place after the CTUWS, as a member of the National Civil Society Alliance to Monitor the Elections, monitored and followed up the results of the referendum which was made on March 26, 2007, on the amendments to the Constitution. The monitoring process included constituencies of Qena Governorate. Further, the CTUWS issued a report on the results of the referendum including the infringements and the interventions that took place in all the monitored constituencies. The closing down of the Naj-Hamadi and Mahalla branches and the continued harassment of other CTUWS sections are in flagrant violation of Article 11 of the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 9, 1998, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to the lawful exercise of his or her occupation or profession. Everyone who, as a result of his or her profession, can affect the human dignity, human rights and fundamental freedoms of others should respect those rights and freedoms and comply with relevant national and international standards of occupational and professional conduct or ethics”. Action requested: Please write to the Egyptian authorities and ask them to:  Put an end to all forms of harassment against CTUWS’ activities, repeal the administrative decision to close down its two offices in Naj-Hamadi and Mahalla, and ensure in all circumstances that its members are able to carry out their work freely without any hindrances; Put an end to all forms of harassment against human rights defenders in Egypt; Conform with the provisions of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 9, 1998, in particular its Article 1, which provides that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, above-mentioned Article 11 as well as Article 12(1) that provides “everyone has the rights, individually and in association with others, to participate in peaceful activities against violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms”; Promote and ensure freedom of association in Egypt and ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by Egypt.
