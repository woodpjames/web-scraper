On February 8, 2013, the Smoleninsk District Court rejected an appeal lodged by the 76th Police Station to challenge the January 21 decision.Surprisingly, more than five months later, on May 31, 2013, the Deputy City Attorney of Saint Petersburg requested that the February-8 decision be cancelled, invoking the violation of Article 30.1 of the Code of Administrative Offences (“The right to appeal in the case of administrative offence”) and that the case against Mr. Yakimov be transferred to the Smoleninsk District Court.This new development could lead to further judicial harassment against Mr. Yakimov.The Observatory strongly condemns the request of the Deputy City Attorney of Saint Petersburg to resume the case against Mr. Andrey Yakimov, which seems at merely sanctioning his human rights activities. Accordingly, the Observatory urges the Russian authorities to put an end to any act of harassment against him, including at the judicial level.Background information:On November 2, 2012, three individuals, including Mr. Yakimov, informed the prefecture that a peaceful rally would be held in Saint Petersburg, in accordance with the law[1], in commemoration of the seventh anniversary of the death of Timur Kacharava, a young antifascist activist who was stabbed to death on November 13, 2005. The said declaration mentioned the participation of 20 persons.On November 8, 2012, they received the agreement of the municipal authorities.On November 13, 2012, 15 persons reportedly attended this rally as participants. Other individuals only passed by to visit the spot where Timur Kacharava was murdered in 2005, in order to leave flowers. The only other persons present during the permitted period (5pm-7pm) were journalists, whose function was to cover the event and cannot be considered as participants. It is to be noted that, from the beginning of the commemorative rally, members of the police present were rude with some participants. It is to be further noted that one of the participants reportedly heard a policeman saying in his walkie-talkie that one of the organisers was detained, though at that time all participants who had planned to participate in the gathering were present at the specified location.Finally, ten minutes before the official ending of the rally, while the participants started to head toward the underground station, a police officer stopped Mr. Andrey Yakimov and told him to stay with them for a few minutes in order to sign a document, enjoining him to sit in a police vehicle. However, as soon as Mr. Yakimov did so, the car left and took him to the police station. Once at the police station, a police file was opened, charging Mr. Andrey Yakimov for “exceeding the number of participants initially planned for a rally”, in contravention with Article 20.2 of the Code of Administrative Offences (“Violating the Established Procedure for Arranging or Conducting a Meeting, Rally, Demonstration, Procession or Picket”). Mr. Yakimov was finally released later on the same day.In the police record, Mr. Andrey Yakimov insisted that no more than 20 participants were present at the rally. This information was confirmed later by witnesses in court. Moreover, it is to be highlighted that, on May 18, 2012, the Constitutional Court issued a resolution stating that the organisers of a rally could not be held responsible in case the number of declared participants would be exceeded. However, and despite the lack of evidence incriminating him, a first hearing was scheduled on November 14, 2012 before Court 209 (Mirovoy sud, 209 Uchastok), and the judge decided to postpone it to November 26, 2012 in order to call the police officers to testify as witnesses of the prosecution. On November 26, the police officers did no show up and the hearing was postponed. On December 24, another hearing took place where one of the police officers who had arrested Mr. Andrey Yakimov testified, mentioning that the protest took place peacefully and only seven people were holding banners in memory of Timur Kacharava. The hearing was then postponed to January 21, 2013.Actions requested:Please write to the authorities of Russian Federation, urging them to:i.
