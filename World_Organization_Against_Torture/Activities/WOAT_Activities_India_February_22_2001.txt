Brief description of the facts :  The Observatory has been informed by Amnesty International of the extra-judicial killing of Mohammad Azam Ali, the Andhra Pradesh Civil Liberties Committee (APCLC) Nalgonda branch District Secretary, on 18th February 2001   He was reportedly killed by two unidentified men in Nalgonda town. He was about to attend a meeting to commemorate the death of APCLC Joint Secretary T. Puroshottam, who was attacked and killed in similar circumstances in November 2000 (See IND 001 / 0011 / OBS 117)  The Andhra Pradesh government has ordered a judicial inquiry into the killing of human rights defender Azam Ali.  The Home Minister announced the inquiry in a statement to the Legislative Assembly, in which he condemned the killing.  However, Observatory is concerned that the state government has not provided vital information about the scope of the inquiry, how long it will last and who will be in charge.  Furthermore, the independent character of this inquiry is important in investigating the possible connivance between the police and the killers of both Puroshottam and Azam Ali.  According to Amnesty International, there are reports that Azam Ali's killers are ex-members of an armed group, with links to the two men in judicial custody accused of the killing of T. Puroshottam. Despite repeated appeals, the police have refused to order a judicial inquiry into the killing of T. Puroshottam, or into the continuing threats against human rights defenders and allegations that police have been actively involved in attacks on human rights defenders.  Action requested :  Please write to the Indian authorities urging them to:  i.-	order an immediate impartial and independent investigation into this killing ;  ii.-	abide by the provisions of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9th 1998 (« Declaration on the Rights and Responsibility of individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognised Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms ») and more particularly article 12.2 which provides that « The State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration »).  iii.-	more generally abide by the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the regional and the international covenants ratified by India.
