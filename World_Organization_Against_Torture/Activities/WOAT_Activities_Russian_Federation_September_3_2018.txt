The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint
partnership of FIDH and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), requests
your urgent intervention in the following situation in Russia.
 
Description of the situation:
 
The
Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the arbitrary detention
and the ongoing judicial harassment against Mr. Yuri Dmitriyev[1],
a historian and representative of 
“Memorial” International Historical, Educational, Human Rights and
Charitable Society in the northern republic of Karelia, in Russia.

According
to the information received, on August 21, 2018, the
Petrozavodsk City Court extended the pre-trial detention of Mr. Yuri Dmitriyev,
whose judicial harassment began in December 2016, until October 26, 2018. On
the following day, Mr. Dmitriyev’s lawyer was informed of the completion of the
preliminary investigation and was given five days, until August 27, 2018, to
get familiarised with case materials. The trial hearing is scheduled for
September 18, 2018. If found guilty, Mr. Dmitriyev faces from 12 to 20 years of
prison. 
 
Mr.
Yuri Dmitriyev has dedicated his life to locating and documenting the remains
of victims of Stalinist repressions. In 1997, Mr. Dmitriev was part of a team that uncovered a mass grave
in Sandarmokh (north-west Russia), which attracted significant national and
international attention, in the form of commemorative actions, but angered
Russian officials intent on marginalizing Soviet-era crimes. Up until the time
of his arrest in 2016, Mr. Dmitriyev had been very active in efforts to
memorialize the victims of Soviet-era human rights repressions and documented
abuses through exhumations and tireless compilation of archives. 
 
Back
in 2016, Mr. Dmitriyev was charged with child pornography, for taking naked
pictures of his adoptive daughter between 2008 and 2015 when the girl was
between two and nine years old. Mr. Yuri Dmitriyev claimed in court that the
pictures were made to monitor her health. He also faced an illegal arms
possession charge for keeping an old hunting rifle in his home. 
 
During
the trial that started in June 2017 and was closed to the public, an expert
evaluation found the incriminated pictures non-pornographic and a psychological
examination of the girl established that Mr. Yuri Dmitriyev had caused no harm
to his child. The conclusions of the psychiatric examination of Mr. Dmitriyev
found no pedophile inclinations. In April 2018, the Petrozavodsk
City Court acquitted Mr. Yuri Dmitriyev on child pornography charges but found
him guilty on illegal arm possession charges and condemned him to 2,5 months of
restriction of movement. By the time of the acquittal, he had spent over one
year in arbitrary detention. 
 
On
June 14, 2018, Karelia’s High Court overturned the ruling, after the
Prosecutor’s office reportedly presented a new psychological examination of Mr.
Dmitriyev’s adoptive daughter, made after the decision of acquittal. Neither
Mr. Yuri Dmitriyev nor his lawyer were notified about the new examination or
apprised of the results. The case was simply sent for retrial on the basis of
“newly discovered circumstances”. 

On June 27, 2018, Mr. Yuri Dmitriyev was arrested by traffic police while he
was travelling out of Petrozavodsk. He was then placed in pre-trial detention.
On June 30, 2018, he was charged with “violent acts of a sexual nature in
relation to a person who has not reached the age of fourteen” under paragraph
"B" Part 4 of Article 132 of the Criminal Code. 
 
In
mid-July 2018, the historian was transferred to Saint Petersbourg for a
psychiatric expertise that was supposed to end on August 8, 2018. While the
results thereof had to be made known to his lawyer on August 22, 2018, no
information is publicly available so far. 
 
The
Observatory strongly condemns the arbitrary detention and judicial harassment
against Mr. Yuri Dmitriyev and calls on Russian authorities to immediately and
unconditionally release him, as well as drop all charges against him, as they
are only aimed at punishing his legitimate human rights activities. 
 
Actions requested:

               In June 2018, the European Union urged Russia to drop
all “dubious” charges against Mr. Yuri Dmitriyev. Earlier, he was recognized a
political prisoner by the Human Rights Center “Memorial”, which demanded his
immediate release. For more information see:    https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage/47471/statement-cases-russian-human-rights-defenders-oyub-titiev-and-yuri-dmitriev_en
