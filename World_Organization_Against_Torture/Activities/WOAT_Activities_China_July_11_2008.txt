New information: The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about further acts of torture and ill-treatments against Mrs. Mao Hengfeng, a Shanghai activist who has been active in defending housing rights, opposing forced evictions and also in promoting women’s reproductive rights. According to the information received, on July 4, 2008, Mrs. Mao Hengfeng could spoke with her family on the phone. She informed them that, on June 3, 2008, she was taken against her will to the prison hospital in Nanhui district, Shanghai. At the hospital, Mrs. Mao was guarded by a dozen female prisoners who were selected by the prison authorities. They stripped Mrs. Mao naked and tied her tightly to a bed, where she was left for fourteen days. With the help of the prisoners-guards, doctors forcibly injected Mrs. Mao a dozen kinds of unknown medication, which left her a severe headache and an intense burning sensation in her body. Doctors also forcibly drew blood from Mrs. Mao. As she struggled against those restraining her, Mrs. Mao bled profusely. Mrs. Mao was also beaten. The prisoners-guards pinched and beat her, injuring her breast, mouth and genitals. In the sweltering heat of Shanghai summer (with temperatures in high twenties Celsius), the prisoners covered Mrs. Mao with a blanket. Sometimes they would cover her mouth and nose with clothes, which nearly suffocated her. Mrs. Mao was also not allowed to wash. On June 16, 2008, Mrs. Mao was released from the hospital. She is currently held in the Shanghai Women’s Prison. The prison authorities recently added a shutter to Mrs. Mao’s only window, leaving a crack to her cell and making it very stuffy. The Observatory reiterates its deep concern about the ongoing abusive and humiliating treatment which Mrs. Mao Hengfeng is being subjected while in detention, and considers her detention as arbitrary, as the grounds for her sentencing very probably aim at sanctioning her activity in favour of human rights. The Observatory calls upon the Chinese authorities to guarantee in all circumstances her physical and psychological integrity. The Observatory condemns more generally the recurrent use of torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment against human rights defenders, in violation of the provisions of the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment ratified by the PRC, and of UN General Assembly Resolution A/RES/61/153 which provides that freedom from such treatments “is a non-derogable right that must be protected under all circumstances”. The Observatory wishes to recall that the National People’s Congress amended the Chinese Constitution in 2004 to include that “ the State respects and safeguards human rights” and that in April 2006, the PRC submitted a document to the UN Secretariat in order to support its candidacy to the Human Rights Council’s first election[1], in which it affirmed that the amendment to the Constitution was aiming at “defining the position of human rights in the overall national development strategy”. The Observatory further wishes to point out that as a member of the Human Rights Council, China “shall uphold the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights”[2].  Background information: On January 12, 2007, Mrs. Mao Hengfeng was sentenced by the Yangpu People’s District Court to two and a half years’ imprisonment for “intentional damage to property”, after she broke one lamp in the room where she had been placed under “soft detention”, without a warrant, from May 23 to June 30, 2006[3]. On April 16, 2007, the Shanghai Municipal N° 2 Intermediate People’s Court upheld, on appeal, the sentencing of Mrs. Mao. The hearing only lasted ten minutes and her lawyer was prevented from entering the courtroom. On May 15, 2007, Mrs. Mao Hengfeng was transferred from the police detention centre to prison, in particularly degrading circumstances, as she was only given one very thin and loose shirt to wear, which could hardly cover her body. When she protested, police beat her up and, upon arrival at the prison, she was immediately put in solitary confinement. Mrs. Mao subsequently started a hunger strike to protest against her situation. On three occasions, prison guards forced her to eat, tying her hands and opening her mouth by force, and inserting a tube into her throat. Prison guards also assigned several inmates to watch and insult her. Moreover, Mrs. Mao suffers from high blood pressure and arthritis with painful joints, and her detention conditions are extremely harsh: with no chairs or bed provided to her, she has to sit or lie on the cold and wet floor. On June 28, 2007, her husband visited her, and requested that the prison authorities allow her lawyer to visit her and help her prepare for an appeal against her sentence, as well as to improve her conditions of detention. On September 13, 2007, at the instigation of prison authorities, a fellow inmate was forced to beat Mrs. Mao Hengfeng in retaliation for revealing that she had been held in solitary confinement for 70 days in July and August 2007, in violation of Article 15 of the Chinese Prison Law (which stipulates a maximum of 15 days). Mrs. Mao was covered with bruises from the beating. She also reported having been force-fed. On September 24, 2007, prison authorities sent Mrs. Mao to the Nanhui prison hospital. She had earlier refused to undergo a medical check-up, fearing of being forcibly injected with drugs. At the hospital, Mrs. Mao was tied to a bed so that she could only move her fingers. She was held in this way until October 15, 2007, monitored by closed-circuit television, and force-fed by other inmates. Furthermore, her husband, Mr. Wu Xuwei, was prevented from visiting her at the Shanghai Women’s Prison until October 26, 2007. On that date, Mrs. Mao and her husband were supervised by prison guards, who stopped her from speaking several times when she attempted to go into details about being force-fed. Mrs. Mao Hengfeng had already been subjected to various acts of harassment and detentions in the past (See Observatory Annual Reports 2005 and 2006). Actions requested: Please write to the authorities in the People’s Republic of China, urging them to:   Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mrs. Mao Hengfeng;  Release Mrs. Mao Hengfeng as well as all petitioners that are currently arbitrarily detained, and put an end to any kind of harassment against her;  Order a thorough and impartial investigation into the above-mentioned acts of torture and ill-treatments against Mrs. Mao Hengfeng in order to identify all those responsible, bring them before a civil competent and impartial tribunal and apply to them the penal sanctions provided by the law;  Guarantee that adequate reparation is provided to Mrs. Mao Hengfeng;  Put an end to the harassment against all human rights defenders in China;  Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, and Article 12.2, which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”;  Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by the People’s Republic of China.

[3] From February 13 to March 29, 2006, Mrs. Mao was put under house arrest in a flat in the Yangpu district of Shanghai on suspicion of “causing disturbance on a public thoroughfare”. While under house arrest, Mrs. Mao was under constant surveillance and was beaten several times, in addition of being deprived access to her lawyer. Her arrest followed her participation, in early February, in a nationwide hunger-strike in support of several human rights defenders who had started a hunger strike against the violence and the repression of Chinese authorities. On May 23, 2006, Mrs. Mao Hengfeng was arrested once again by the police of Yangpu district without an arrest warrant, and placed under “soft” house arrest in Kelaideng Hostel.
