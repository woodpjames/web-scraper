New information:   The Observatory has been informed by the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights that on October 28, 2004, Mr. Abdul Rawf Al-Shayeb, spokesman of the National Committee for Martyrs and Victims of Torture in Bahrain and Mr. Mahmud Ramadan, a board member of the Committee, were arrested by the anti-riot Police, together with several dozens demonstrators during a Car Parade protest march organized by the Committee.   The purpose of the march was to call for the release of Mr. Abdul Hadi Al-Khawaja, the executive director of the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights (BCHR), who has been detained since September 26, 2004, in Howdh Aljaf detention centre.   Mr. Abdul Rawf Al-Shayeb, Mr. Mahmud Ramadan and the other demonstrators arrested are currently detained in West Riffa Prison. About a hundred demonstrators received letters of summons to appear at the Police department.  Moreover, on October 28 in the morning, Mr. Al-Khawaja’s wife received a phone call from the police summoning her to appear at the police department. She was threatened to be arrested if she failed to do so.   Background information<7b>  On October 25, 2004, Abdul Hadi Al-Khawaja, the BCHR's executive director, charged with inciting hatred against the regime, was denied bail for the third time since his first court hearing on October 16. The trial was adjourned to November 3, 2004.  On September 26, 2004, the BCHR’s leading activist, Al-Khawaja, was arrested after he had criticized the government’s policy, in particular the Prime Minister, during a symposium on economic rights in Bahrain, organized by BCHR on September 24. He was charged for « encouraging hate of the state » and « distributing falseness and rumours » on the basis of articles 165 and 168 of the Bahraini penal code and remanded in custody for 45 days in Howdh Aljaf detention centre.   Following the symposium, a Committee composed of different governmental institutions was also created on September 26, by the Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, Mr. Majeed Al-Alawi, with the aim of « taking punitive and legal actions against the BCHR ».  On September 29, 2004, Mr. Al- Alawi, declared in a press release that he had issued an order of dissolution of the BCHR the night before, the order coming into force that same day. The official motive behind this decision is that the BCHR would have violated Law No. 21 of 1989 on Societies, without any other precision.    Action requested:  Please write to the authorities of the Kingdom Bahrain urging them to:   i. Release Mr. Al-Khawaja immediately and unconditionally and drop the charges against him, his detention and the charges against him being arbitrary;  ii. Release Mr. Abdul-Raoof Al-Shayeb, Mr. Mahmud Ramadan and other activists arbitrarily detained;  iii. Rehabilitate the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights (BCHR) and put an immediate end to any obstacles to its activities;  iv. Conform with the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders adopted by the UN General Assembly on 9 December 1998, in particular article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually or in association with others, to promote the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels,” and article 5(b), stating that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, at the national and international levels to form, join and participate in non-governmental organizations, associations or groups;”  v. Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with the Declaration and all other international human rights standards.
