Description of the situation: The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the incommunicado detention of Ms. Hana Abdi, a member of the women’s rights NGO Azar Mehr and an active member of the “One Million Signatures” Campaign[1]. According to the information received, on November 4, 2007, Ms. Hana Abdi was arrested by seven security officers in her grandfather’s home in Sanandaj, Kurdistan. Following her arrest, the officers searched her father’s home and confiscated her computer and educational pamphlets related to the Campaign. As of issuing this urgent appeal, her whereabouts remain unknown and all attempts to locate her by members of her family have failed. The Observatory expresses its deep concern about Ms. Abdi’s incommunicado detention, and strongly condemns the increasing repression of the Iranian authorities against human rights defenders, in particular women’s rights activists involved in the “One Million Signatures” Campaign. To that extent, the Observatory recalls that on November 4, Ms. Delaram Ali, another member of the Campaign, was sentenced by the Teheran Court of Appeal to 10 lashes and two years and six months imprisonment for “participation in an illegal gathering”, “propaganda against the system”, and “disturbing public order”[2]. According to the latest information received, the implementation of her sentence would have been suspended by the Iranian Head of Judiciary. The Observatory further recalls that Ms. Ronak Safarzadeh, another member of the Campaign who was arrested on October 9, 2007, remains detained at the local office of the Ministry of Information and Security in Sanandaj, with limited contact with her family and no access to her lawyers[3]. Furthermore, the Observatory wishes to insist on the fact that Iran had committed to “uphold the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights”[4] by presenting its candidacy to the Human Rights Council 2006 election and had insisted in this regard on the fact that the country had “continuously put great efforts into safeguarding the status and inherent dignity of the human person as well as the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms”[5]. In order to ensure the continuation of these efforts, the Observatory urges the Islamic Republic of Iran to conform with international human rights standards. Actions requested: Please write to the authorities in Iran urging them to:  i. Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Ms. Hana Abdi, Ms. Delaram Ali and Ms. Ronak Safarzadeh, as well as all activists engaged in the “One Million Signatures” campaign; ii. Release Ms. Hana Abdi and Ms. Ronak Safarzadeh immediately and unconditionally since their detention is arbitrary as it merely aims at sanctioning their activities in favour of women’s human rights; iii. Drop all arbitrary charges against all women’s rights defenders involved in the “One million signatures” campaign; iv. Put an end to all acts of harassment, including at the judicial level, against Iranian human rights defenders; v. Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, Article 6.b, which provides that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others [...] freely to publish, impart or disseminate to others views, information and knowledge on all human rights and fundamental freedoms”, and Article 12.2, which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”; vi. More generally, ensure in all circumstances the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with international and regional human rights instruments ratified by Iran.
