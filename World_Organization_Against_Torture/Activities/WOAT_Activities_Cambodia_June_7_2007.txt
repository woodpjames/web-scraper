Brief description of the situation: The Observatory has been informed by the Cambodian League for the Promotion and Defence of Human Rights (LICADHO) about the threats against the UK-based NGO Global Witness, which is particularly active in the protection of the environment and natural resources, and the obstacles to its work in Cambodia. According to The Cambodian Daily, on June 3, 2007, the Cambodian Minister of Information, Mr. Khieu Kanharith, issued a statement, saying that the government was banning Global Witness latest report and would confiscate any copies found in the country. He reportedly said the report was “a politically motivated attack on Prime Minister Hun Sen and retaliation for the group’s expulsion from Cambodia in 2005”. Global Witness report, titled “Cambodia’s Family Trees: Illegal logging and the stripping of public assets by Cambodia’s elite”, was released on June 1, 2007. It notably accuses members of the Cambodian ‘kleptocratic elite’ of massive environmental plunder and participation in a logging syndicate[1]. It also denounces the illegal destruction of Cambodia’s forests carried out by family members and business associates of Prime Minister Hun Sen, his wife, and other senior officials. On June 4, 2007, Mr. Hun Neng, Kompong Cham provincial Governor and the Prime Minister’s brother, declared that he was considering to take legal action over the allegations made in the report against members of his family. He added that if Global Witness’s members came to Cambodia, he would “hit them until their heads are broken”. The Observatory is deeply concerned about the continuing threats on human rights defenders and civil society in general, as well as the restrictions on their work and the exercise of freedom of expression  in Cambodia. Actions required: Please write to the authorities of Cambodia urging them to:  Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Global Witness members and put an end to any kind of obstacle to their work; Put an end to any kind of act of harassment and threats against Global Witness as well as against all human rights defenders in the country; Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national             and international levels” and article 12.2, which states that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”; Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by the Kingdom of Cambodia.
