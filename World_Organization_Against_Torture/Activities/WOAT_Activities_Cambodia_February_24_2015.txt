The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint
programme of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and the
International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), requests your urgent
intervention in the following situation in Cambodia.
 
Description of the situation:
 
The Observatory has been informed by the Cambodian Human Rights and
Development Association (ADHOC), about the arrest and deportation of human and environmental
rights defender Mr. Alejandro Gonzalez-Davidson, Director and co-founder
of the Mother Nature NGO.
According to the information received, Mr. Gonzalez-Davidson was
arrested on February 23, at about 1:15 pm local time, at a restaurant in
central Phnom Penh by Interior Ministry officers. He was taken in an unmarked
car to the Phnom Penh Immigration Department and afterwards forced to leave the
country.
Mr. Gonzalez-Davidson was deported after immigration authorities refused
to renew his visa, following orders from Interior Minister Sar Kheng. Although
his visa expired on February 20, 2015, Mr. Gonzalez-Davidson had vowed to
remain in the country to continue working to support local communities.
According to Cambodia's immigration laws, Mr. Gonzalez-Davidson was entitled to
stay in the country for a grace period of 37 days after his visa expiration.
Earlier that day, Prime Minister Hun Sen warned the defiant human and
environmental rights defender that he would be deported and blacklisted if he
failed to leave Cambodia voluntarily.
It is worth mentioning that Mr. Gonzalez-Davidson has been at the
forefront of a campaign by Mother Nature NGO to halt the development of the
Stung Cheay Areng hydropower dam in Koh Kong Province. He was briefly detained
on September 15, 2014, along with other 11 local environmental rights defenders,
for blocking a road and preventing Koh Kong provincial governor Phon Lyvirak
and Chinese experts from visiting the dam project site.
The Observatory fears that the refusal to renew Mr. Gonzalez-Davidson's
visa and his subsequent deportation is a direct attempt of the Cambodian
Government to prevent him from continuing his work as a human rights defender
and particularly aims at sanctioning its campaign to protect environmental
rights in Koh Kong Province.
The Observatory urges the Cambodian government to reconsider its
decision and to allow Mr. Gonzalez-Davidson to continue working to support
local communities in the country.
 
Actions requested:
 
Please write to the authorities of the Kingdom of Cambodia asking them
to:

     promote the protection and fulfilment of human rights and fundamental
