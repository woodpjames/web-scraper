Judicial harassment
Thailand
July 5, 2017
 
The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a partnership of the
World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and FIDH, requests your urgent
intervention in the following situation in Thailand. 
 
Brief description of the situation:
 
The
Observatory has been informed by reliable
sources about ongoing judicial harassment against members of the Khon Rak Ban Kerd Group
(KRBKG), a community-based group committed to defend the local environment from
the negative impacts of the open-pit copper-gold mine, operated by the Tungkum
company in Thailand’s Loei province[1].
 
According to the information received, on June 27, 2017, the Public
Prosecutor again postponed the indictment of seven women members of KRBKG, Ms. Pornthip Hongchai, Ms. Viron Rujichaiyavat, Ms. Ranong Kongsaen, Ms. Mon Khunna, Ms. Suphat Khunna, Ms. Boonraeng
Srithong, and Ms. Lumplearn
Ruengrith. The indictment was originally
scheduled for May 25, 2017, but was postponed first to June 27, 2017 and now to
July 25, 2017. The Observatory is concerned about
this series of postponements, which amounts to additional harassment against
the seven defenders.
 
The
seven women are facing legal prosecution for their involvement in legitimate
activities on November 16, 2016, when more than 200 KRBKG members and villagers
marched from Ban Na Nong Bong village to the Khoa Lunag Administrative Council
Office, and peacefully staged a peaceful sit-in protest in
front of the council meeting room, to demand community participation in the
decision-making process concerning the granting of forest land use to Tungkum. Members of the administrative council ultimately called off the
scheduled meeting due to the protest and filed a complaint with the
police.
 
On March 8, 2017, Thai police in Wang Sa Pung District, Loei province,
charged the seven women KRBKG members for allegedly violating Section 309 of
Thailand’s Criminal Code for forcing local
council members to cancel the meeting. In addition, Ms. Pornthip Hongchai, one of the leaders and spokespersons of KRBKG,
was charged under Articles 10 and 28 of the Public
Assembly Act for failing to notify the authorities about the protest. The case
was then transferred to the Public Prosecutor to
decide whether to indict the women based on the police investigation.
 
On
June 13, 2017, the police filed additional charges against the seven women
under Articles 8 and 27 of the Public Assembly Act for public gathering that
blocks entries or disrupts service of government agencies. The offense carries
a maximum penalty of six months in prison and a 10,000 THB (258 EUR) fine,
or both.
 
The
seven women human rights defenders are facing each up to five years in prison
and 100,000 THB (about 2,586 EUR) fine, or both. Ms. Pornthip Hongchai faces
additional fine of up to 10,000 THB (258 EUR) for the extra charge under
Article 10 of the Public Assembly Act.
 
The
Observatory recalls that this case is one of 21 criminal and civil complaints initiated
against villagers in Loei province, 19 of which were filed by Tungkum. Thai
authorities filed the two other complaints against the Loei villagers. Tungkum
previously brought a defamation lawsuit against three
out of seven women, Ms.
Viron Rujichaiyavat, Ms. Pornthip Hongchai, and Ms. Mon Khunna[2],
until the Loei Provincial Court dismissed the case on
March 30, 2016.
 
The
Observatory strongly condemns the acts of ongoing judicial harassment against
the seven women and other members of KRBKG, which only aims at punishing them
for their legitimate human rights activities. The Observatory calls upon both the Thai judicial
authorities and Tungkum to end all forms of harassment - including at the
judicial level - against all the above-mentioned
defenders, and
drop all charges against them.

communities near the mine formed the KRBKG in 2007 to advocate for a clean
environment and to oppose the mining operations. On March 7, 2016, the National
Human Rights Commission of Thailand honoured women of the KRBKG with a
prestigious human rights defenders award for their role in bringing attention
to critical human rights problems in Thailand.
