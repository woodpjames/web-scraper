The Observatory for the Protection of
Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the International Federation for
Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), requests
your urgent intervention in the following situation in Belarus.
Description of the situation:
The Observatory has been informed by
reliable sources of a warning issued today against Mr. Ales Bialatski,
President of the Human Rights Centre (HRC) “Viasna” and FIDH Vice-President, by
the Public Prosecutor. 
On February 14, 2011, Mr. Bialatski had
been summoned by phone to the office of the  Public Prosecutor “for a talk” today. 
A written warning was handed to Mr.
Bialatski by the Public Prosecutor on the same day alleging that the human
rights activities of the HRC “Viasna” are breaching the Belarusian legislation
since the organisation is not registered with the Ministry of Justice, and that
criminal proceedings could therefore be launched. 
The Observatory recalls that on the basis
of Article 193.1 of the Belarusian Criminal Code, criminal proceedings can be
launched against individuals acting within a non-registered organisation. The
Observatory deplores that the HRC “Viasna” has been denied registration, most
recently on August 12, 2009 by the Belarusian Supreme Court[1],
contravening a July 2007 United Nations Human Rights Committee[2]
decision, which had concluded that the dissolution of Viasna violated Article
22.1 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and that the
co-authors of the complaint were “entitled to an appropriate remedy, including
the re-registration of Viasna”.
The Observatory denounces the issuance of
this warning, which manifestly aims at sanctioning the human rights activities
of Mr. Bialatski and the HRC “Viasna”. 
The Observatory urges the Belarusian
authorities to refrain from harassing human rights defenders. The Observatory
calls upon the Belarusian authorities to conform in all circumstances with the
United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights as well as international and regional human rights instruments
ratified by Belarus.
Actions requested:
The Observatory urges the authorities of
Belarus to:
i. Repeal the
warning issued against Mr. Ales Bialatski as it only aims at sanctioning his
human rights activities;
ii. Put an end
to all forms of harassment against Mr. Ales Bialatski and the staff members of
HRC “Viasna” and against all human rights defenders in Belarus and ensure they are, in all circumstances, able to carry out their work
freely without any hindrances;
iii. Put an end to all acts of harassment
against human rights defenders in Belarus;
iv. Comply with all the provisions of the
United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, , adopted on December 9,
1998 by the United Nations General Assembly, in particular with:
-        
its Article 1, which provides that “everyone has the right, individually
and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and
realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and
international levels”;
-        
its Article 5, which provides that “everyone has the right, individually
and in association with others, at the national and international levels […] to
meet or assemble peacefully; [...…] to form, join and participate in
non-governmental organizations, associations or groups [...…] to communicate
with non-governmental or intergovernmental organizations.
-        
Its Article 6 (b) and (c) which
states that “Everyone has the right, individually and in association with
others, as provided for in human rights and other applicable international
instruments, freely to publish, impart or disseminate to others views,
information and knowledge on all human rights and fundamental freedoms; to study, discuss, form and hold opinions on
the observance, both in law and in practice, of all human rights and
fundamental freedoms and, through these and other appropriate means, to draw
public attention to those matters,
-        
and its Article 12.2 which provides that “the State shall take all
necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of
everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence,
threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or
any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise
of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”. 
v. More generally, ensure in all
circumstances the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in
accordance with in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
and with international and regional human rights instruments ratified by
Belarus.
