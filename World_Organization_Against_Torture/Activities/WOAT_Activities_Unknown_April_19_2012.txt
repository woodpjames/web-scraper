The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint 
programme of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World 
Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), has received new information and requests 
your urgent intervention in the following situation in Iran. 

 
New information:
 
The Observatory has been informed by the Iranian League for the 
Defence of Human Rights (LDDHI) of the release on bail of Mr. Kouhyar Goudarzi, a 
member of the Committee of Human Rights Reporters 
(CHRR).
 
According to the information received, on April 12, 2012, Mr. 
Goudarzi was released on bail pending his trial on appeal. 

 
The Observatory welcomes the release on bail of Mr. Kouhyar Goudarzi and thanks all the persons, institutions and organisations who 
intervened in his favour. However, it recalls that Mr. Saeed 
Jalalifar, another member of the CHRR and also a former member of the 
Association for Defence of Street and Working Children, is still serving a 
three-year prison sentence, while prison sentences of two other CHRR members, 
Ms. Shiva Nazarahari, also a member of the “One Million 
Signatures” Campaign, and Mr. Navid Khanjani, have been upheld 
and they are at risk of arbitrary arrest any time[1]. 

 
Background information:
 
Mr. Kouhyar Goudarzi was arrested in December 2009 and subsequently 
sentenced to one year in prison on charges, among others, of “propaganda 
activity against the regime through effective collaboration with the Committee 
of Human Rights Reporters website”, “collection and publishing of biased news 
against the regime and transfer of this information to terrorist organisations 
based abroad” as well as “interviews with foreign media and publishing articles 
in websites,” pursuant to Islamic Penal Code of Iran. He served the sentence and 
was released on December 14, 2010[2]. On July 30 or 31, 
2011, Mr. Goudarzi was again arrested in Tehran and his whereabouts remained 
unknown during the first several few weeks in what was tantamount to enforced 
disappearance. A day after his arrest, in the morning of July 31 or August 1, 
2011, his mother Ms. Parvin Mokhtar’e was also arbitrarily arrested at her home 
in Kerman, by four plainclothes agents, without a warrant. While in detention, 
she was informed that she had been accused of “insulting the Supreme leader”, 
“propaganda against the regime”, and “acting against national security”, whereas 
she had no political or human rights-related activities. In December 2011, after 
spending nearly five months in Kerman prison, she was sentenced to 23 months of 
imprisonment on charges of “assembly, collusion and spreading propaganda against 
the State” by the Kerman Islamic Revolution Court. On appeal, the sentence was 
reduced to 23 months of suspended imprisonment. She was also sentenced to cash 
fine for “insulting the martyrs”, which she paid, before being released on March 
18, 2012. 
 
On February 26, 2012, Mr. Kouhyar Goudarzi was sentenced by Branch 26 
of the Islamic Revolution Court to five years of imprisonment to be served in 
internal exile in the remote south-eastern city of Zabul. He was convicted on 
charges of “propaganda against the regime” through an interview with the German 
magazine Der Spiegel, in which he spoke about his hunger strike in solidarity with 
prisoners and his former cellmates, and “assembly and collusion against the 
regime”. Although he lodged an appeal, he remained detained in Section 209 of 
Evin prison under control of the Ministry of Intelligence. Since his arrest in 
July 2011, he spent more than two months in solitary 
confinement.

Ms. Shiva Nazarahari as well as all human rights defenders and their families in

individually and in association with others, at the national and international 
levels, (…) to form, join and participate in non-governmental organizations, 
associations or groups”;
-        its article 12.2 which provides that “the State shall take all 
necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of 
everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, 
threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure 
adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence
