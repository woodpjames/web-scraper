The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of
FIDH and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent
intervention in the following situation in Slovakia. 
 
Description of the situation:
 
The
Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the violent attack
perpetrated against Ms. Alena Krempaská, a member of the Institute for
Human Rights (Institut ludskych prav - ILP)[1].

 
According to
the information received, in the evening of September 5, 2016, while she was
leaving the ILP office in Bratislava, Ms. Alena Krempaská was attacked by two
unidentified men. She was pushed on the floor, beaten and insulted, and was
told by her assailants that the attack aimed at sanctioning her “links with the
social-democratic party”. It has to be noted, however, that the ILP is an
independent NGO, and has no partnership whatsoever with any political party.
 
Ms.
Krempaská sustained a severe injury on the head, and spent one night at the
hospital. 
 
A few hours
before the attack, she had been verbally threatened together with other ILP
activists during a protest organised by ILP, to counter a rally organised by
right-wing parliamentary parties[2]
in front of the Prime Minister’s house, where around 200 persons had gathered.
This right-wing rally aimed at denouncing alleged connections between the Prime
Minister and the Minister of Interior with M. Ladislav Bašternák, a businessman
facing charges of tax fraud.
 
On that
occasion, 40 activists of the ILP, including Ms. Krempaská and ILP Executive Director Mr. Peter
Weisenbacher, had decided to organise a counter protest in
the same area, to denounce the opportunistic appropriation of the corruption
issue by the right-wing parties, and to call for investigations into attacks
routinely carried out by far-right supporters against peaceful protesters.
 
During the rally, the former chair of the Slovak
Parliament and Member of the European Parliament Richard Sulík (SaS), together
with the leader of OľaNO, Igor Matovič, groundlessly accused ILP members,
including Ms. Krempaská and Mr. Weisenbacher, of “financial fraud”, and invited
the crowd to intimidate them by shouting at them.
 
Following the above-mentioned physical attack, Ms.
Krempaská filed a complaint with the Bratislava Police Station, which handed
out the investigation to the Country Directorate of Bratislava City.
 
The Observatory strongly condemns the violent attack
perpetrated against Ms. Krempaská, which seems to only aim at sanctioning her
legitimate human rights activities, and calls the authorities to take effective
measures to protect her integrity as well as the integrity of all human rights
defenders in the country.
 
The
Observatory calls the authorities to carry out an immediate, thorough,
impartial and transparent investigation into the attack sustained by Ms. Alena
Krempaská, in order to identify all those responsible, bring them before an
independent tribunal, and sanction them as provided by the law.
