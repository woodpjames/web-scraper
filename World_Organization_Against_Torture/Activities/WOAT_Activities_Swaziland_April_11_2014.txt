The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint
programme of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World
Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), has received new information and requests
your urgent intervention in the following situation in Swaziland.
 
New
information:
 
The Observatory has been informed about the new arrest of Mr. Thulani
Rudolf Maseko, a prominent Swazi human rights lawyer, senior member of
Lawyers for Human Rights Swaziland and the Southern Africa Human Rights
Defenders Network, as well as of Mr. Bheki Makhubu, a columnist and
Editor-in-Chief of The Nation,
considered as the sole independent newspaper of the country. 
 
According to the information received, on April 9, 2014, Messrs.
Thulani Maseko and Bheki Makhubu were re-arrested following the decision of
Justice Simelane to suspend the judgment that had led to their release on April
6. Both were held overnight at the Mbabane police station.
 
On April 6, High Court Judge Mumcy Dlamini had set aside the arrest
warrant of Mr. Maseko and Mr. Makhubu, following an application lodged by the
two defenders' lawyers seeking a declaratory order that the March-17 arrest
warrant issued against them (see background information) was unconstitutional,
unlawful and irregular. As a consequence, Mr. Maseko and Mr. Makhubu were
released on the same day. 
 
However, on April 7, Justice Michael Ramodibedi, along with the Office
of the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Attorney's General Office and the
Swaziland Government, appealed against the decision of Justice Dlamini. This
appeal is currently pending.
 
On April 9, 2014, Justice Simelane subsequently issued a ruling stating
that the April-7 appeal
had automatically suspended the April-6 decision to free the two defenders, and
that as a consequence they should be re-arrested. Both are currently detained
in the provisional detention centre of Sidwashini, Mbabane. 
 
On the morning of April 10, 2014 a first hearing took place and the
provisional detention of the two defenders was extended until the next hearing
scheduled on April 14, 2014. During the hearing, Mr. Maseko and Mr. Makhubu's
lawyers argued that the initial arrest warrant issued against their clients on
March 17 was irregular, and that their were unlawfully kept in detention.
Justice Simelane reportedly addressed Mr. Maseko and Mr. Makhubu very
disrespectfully and decided to report the matter to a pre-trial to be held on
April 11, and to a next trial hearing on April 14.
 
The Observatory calls upon the Swazi authorities to
release Messrs. Thulani Maseko and Mr. Bheki Makhubu immediately and
unconditionally, and to put an end to the continued judicial harassment against
them, as it only aims at sanctioning their human rights activities.
 
Background
information:
 
On March 17 and 18, 2014 respectively, Messrs. Thulani Maseko and Mr.
Bheki Makhubu were arrested on the basis of a warrant issued by Chief Justice
Michael Ramodibedi, on charges of “scandalising the judiciary” and “contempt of
court” following the publication of articles criticising the judicial system.
 
The charges arise from articles written by Messrs. Thulani Maseko and
Bheki Makhubu in February and March 2014 in The Nation, in which they
questioned circumstances surrounding the arrest of government vehicle
inspector, Bhantshana Vincent Gwebu and criticized the lack of impartiality of
the Swazi judicial system[1].
 
On March 18, 2014, Messrs. Maseko and Makhubu, who were expected to
appear in court, were subjected to a private hearing in the Chief Justice
Ramodibedi’s chambers, in violation of Section 21 of the Constitution of the
Kingdom of Swaziland, which guarantees the right to a fair trial. The accused's
lawyers were not informed that the hearing would take place in the Chief
Justice's chambers and were only present by chance. 
 
They were
kept in custody until the second hearing which took place on March 25, 2014.
They appeared before the High Court of Mbabane assisted by their lawyers. Their
detention was extended until the next hearing, which took place on April 1,
2014. 
 
On April 1,
2014, Messrs. Thulani Maseko and Bheki Makhubu appeared before the High Court
of Mbabane assisted by their lawyers. Their detention was extended for the
third time until the next hearing, scheduled for April 8, 2014. The decision to
extend the custody of the two human rights defenders was taken by Chief Justice
Mpendulo Simelane, who is also the former High Court Registrar mentioned in the
articles published in The Nation for which the two defenders are
currently prosecuted. Since he might be summoned to testify in their case, the
defence lawyers of Mr. Maseko and Mr. Makhubu have informed him of their intent
to file an application to demand his recusal. 
 
Messrs. Maseko and Makhubu were detained in the provisional detention
centre of Sidwashini, Mbabane. 
 
On April 4,
2014, the accused, through their lawyers, filed an application at the High
Court where they were seeking a declaratory order on the grounds that the
warrant of arrest issued by the Chief Justice was unconstitutional, unlawful
and irregular. They argued that the High Court does not have powers to issue
same, instead it was a magistrate who issued warrants.
 
Actions

against him, denied him access to a lawyer, and deprived him from the
opportunity to seek release on bail.
