Judicial harassment
Thailand

The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a partnership of the
World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and FIDH, has received new
information and requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in
Thailand. 
 
New Information:
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources
about the ongoing judicial harassment against four Neo Democracy Movement (NDM)[1]
activists, namely Messrs. Pakorn
Areekul, Anucha Rungmorakot,
Anan Loket, and Phanuwat
Songsawadchai, as well as Prachatai journalist Mr. Taweesak Kerdpoka for distributing
leaflets that urged voters to reject the draft Constitution that was eventually
adopted in a referendum held on August 7, 2016. 

 (c) TLHR
According
to the information received, on September 21, 2016, the Ratchaburi Provincial
Court formally charged the five above-mentioned defenders for alleged violation
of Article 61 of the Referendum Act[2] after holding a conciliation session. Before the session, the defendants
filed a petition to the Attorney General at the Ratchaburi Provincial
Prosecutors’ Office, requesting the acquittal of the case.
 
During the hearing, the Court asked
the five defendant to plead guilty so that the sentence could be reduced. They
refused to do so as they believed their prosecution aimed at sanctioning their
legitimate exercise of the right to freedom of expression. If found guilty,
they face a sentence of up to 10 years in prison, a fine of 200,000 Thai Baht
(approx. 5,125 Euro), and the loss of their electoral rights for 10 years. The
Court will proceed to a witnesses and evidence deposition at 8.30 am on October
17, 2016, as previously scheduled.
 
The Observatory strongly condemns
the above-mentioned judicial harassment and calls on the Thai authorities to
drop all charges against the five and repeal Article 61 of the Referendum Act. Until all charges
are dropped, the Observatory urges the Thai authorities to ensure all judicial
proceedings against the five are carried out in full compliance with their right to a
fair trial, as guaranteed under international law. 
 
Background Information:
 
On July 10, 2016, at around 11:30am,
officers from the Ban Pong police station in Ratchaburi province detained
Messrs. Pakorn Areekul, Anucha Rungmorakot, Anan Loket, and Taweesak Kerdpoka for alleged
violation of Article 61 of the Referendum Act, after they searched
Mr. Pakorn’s pick-up truck and found booklets that criticized Thailand’s
draft Constitution. The three NDM activists had travelled to the Ban Pong
police station to show support for 18 fellow pro-democracy activists who had
been summoned to answer charges of violating the Head of the NCPO Order no.
3/2558, which bans
gatherings of five or more people. The charges stemmed from the
18 activists’ participation in a ceremony to open referendum-monitoring centers
in the province on June 16, 2016. Mr. Taweesak was accompanying the three
NDM activists to report on their activity. University student activist
Mr. Phanuwat Songsawadchai, who had attended the June 16
ceremony, was arrested at his home on the same day at 8:20pm.
 
On July 11, 2016, the Ratchaburi
Provincial Court released all five, with bail set at 140,000 Thai baht (approx.
3,590 Euro) each.
 
On
July 12, 2016, five plainclothes police officers from Sutthisan police station
and a number of soldiers entered the Prachatai
journal premises in Bangkok with a search warrant. While the officials did not
confiscate anything, they thoroughly searched the personal desk of
Mr. Taweesak in addition to the other journalists’ desks and individual
lockers. The authorities also questioned Prachatai
Executive Director Chiranuch Premchaiporn about allegations of the
newspaper’s involvement in printing anti-draft Constitution documents and other
material produced by NDM. Ms. Chiranuch denied any involvement of Prachatai in the printing of such
material.
 
The
Observatory recalls that on June 23, 2016, 13 NDM activists, including Mr. Anan
Loket, had been
arrested by military personnel at a market on the eastern outskirts of Bangkok
in Samut Prakan province, while handing out leaflets that urged voters to
reject the draft Constitution. They were all charged with violating the Head of the NCPO Order
No. 3/2015, and
Article 61 of the 2016 Constitutional Referendum Act, which bans the
dissemination of “false information” about the draft charter with the aim of
influencing voters. If found guilty, all 13 could face up to 10 years’ imprisonment,
a fine of up to 200,000 Thai baht, and have their right to vote revoked by
court for up to 10 years under the Referendum Act.
 
On June 24, 2016, six of the
activists were released on a bail of 50,000 Thai baht (approx. 1,280 Euro)
each, under the condition that they do “not get involved with any act aimed to
instigate, disrupt public order, persuade, compel people to rise up by any
means possible in order to make possible any public assembly which may bring
about public disorder or cause any harm or infringement on peace, order or the
moral high ground of the people or any act which may induce people to commit a
legal offence”. The other seven activists did not submit bail requests, arguing
that they had done nothing wrong and that they would not accept conditions for
their release. 
 
On July 6, the Department of
Corrections released six of the seven democracy activists.
 
The one remaining in detention,
Mr. Korakoch Saengyenpan, was transported to the Thonburi police
station because of previous charges he faced in connection with another case
against 11 pro-democracy activists who undertook an “advocacy trip” to demand
the opening of an investigation into alleged corruption in the
construction of the military-sponsored Rajabhakti Park in Prachuab
Kirikhan province in December 2015. He was finally released on the same
day, July 6, at about 4:30pm. Bail was set at 10,000 Thai baht (approx. 250
Euro)[3].
 
It was reported that the majority of
the detainees lost weight during the span of their custody.
