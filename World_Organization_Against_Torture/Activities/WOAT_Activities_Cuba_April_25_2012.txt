The OMCT submitted an alternative report on Cuba in view of the consideration of the 2nd periodic report of Cuba, which consolidates the 2nd, 3rd and 4th reports of the State Party. The alternative report submitted by the OMCT analyses Cuba’s domestic legislation under the light of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment; it describes the continued repression against political opponents, human rights defenders and independent journalists, highlighting the increase of arbitrary arrests, short-term detentions and other acts of harassment; and it points out the deplorable conditions of detention, which may constitute acts of ill-treatment against the persons deprived of liberty.
In addition, the alternative report on Cuba provides recommendations in relation to the implementation by the State Party of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.
The CAT public session on Cuba will be webcasted by OMCT.
