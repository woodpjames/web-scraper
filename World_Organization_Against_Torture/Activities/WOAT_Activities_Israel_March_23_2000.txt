Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by Al-Haq, a member of the OMCT network,  of the killing of Halima Abdel Aziz Al-Aloul, mother of 12 children, by Israeli Occupation Forces in Israel.  According to the information received, at midnight, March 20, 2000, Halima Abdel Aziz Al-Aloul (Al-Sharouf), 45, mother of 12 children, was killed by the Israeli Occupation Forces in the Hebron District in the West Bank.  She was shot by Israeli soldiers in the area between the two villages of Kharas and Sourif.  According to the affidavit submitted to an al-Haq fieldworker by her husband, Mohammad Ibrahim Al-Tous, 48, he approached a military checkpoint between Khaas and Sourif known as the Wadi al-Aazaz. As he neared the checkpoint he realised he did not have his insurance document for the car, so he turned back from the checkpoint.  At this point, Israeli soldiers fired at least 20 rounds at the car, without any warning to stop.  His wife, seated in the passenger seat, was hit 6 times in the back, head, chest, and neck.  She died immediately and was later taken to the hospital for an autopsy.  At the same time, the husband was also shot in the back. Al-Tous drove 1 km until he fainted.  Citizens took him to the Al-Ahli Hospital in Hebron to the surgery unit to remove the bullet; however they couldn’t find it.  According to the report he was injured in the liver and other internal organs by bullet fragments.  The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned by the use of excessive force and particularly fire arms which violates international human rights standards, in particular Articles 9, 10 and 11 of the United Nations Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials.  Action requested  Please write to the authorities in Israel urging them to:  i.	guarantee an immediate investigation into the circumstances of these events, identify those responsible, bring them before a civil competent and impartial tribunal and apply the penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions provided by law;  ii.	take all necessary measures to guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of Mohammad Ibrahim Al-Tous and ensure that he receive adequate medical assistance;  iii.	ensure that all law enforcement agencies conform to international human rights standards;  iv.	guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
