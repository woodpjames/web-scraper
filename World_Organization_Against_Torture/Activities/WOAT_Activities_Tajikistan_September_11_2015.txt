On 11 September 2015, the OMCT
together with the NGO Coalition against Torture in Tajikistan, the
International Partnership for Human Rights, the Helsinki Foundation for Human
Rights, and the Norwegian Helsinki Committee submitted a report to the
Universal Periodic Review of Tajikistan taking place in April 2016. The report
highlighted torture and ill-treatment in detention and the armed forces, the
lack of legal safeguards in detention, the lack of investigations into torture
and other ill-treatment as well as the lack of reparation and redress for
torture victims.
