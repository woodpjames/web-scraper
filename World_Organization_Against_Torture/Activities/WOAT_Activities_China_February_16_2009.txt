Brief description of the situation The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by The Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy (TCHRD), a member of OMCT SOS-Torture Network, about the arbitrary arrest of Lobsang Lhundup, a 38-year-old monk of Nekhor Monastery born in Gemo Village, in Lithang County, Kardze “Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture” (TAP), on 15 February 2009, and of fifteen individuals (details below) from Lithang County, on 16 February 2009, for staging a peaceful protest. According to the information received, Lobsang Lhundup was arrested on 15 February 2009 for staging a peaceful solo protest demonstration at the main market square of Lithang town for about 15-20 minutes, chanting slogan “'Long Live the Dalai Lama, Independence for Tibet”, “Swift return of the Dalai Lama to Tibet'”and “No Losar (Tibetan New Year) celebration this year”. He was then reportedly forcibly detained by the Public Security Bureau (PSB) and People’s Armed Police (PAP) and taken to the Lithang PSB Detention Centre for further interrogation. According to the same information received, on 16 February 2009 in the morning, a group of fifteen Tibetans from Lithang County, namely Sonam Tenpa (29 years old and brother of Lobsang Lhundup), Jampa Thokmey (30 years old), Gelek Kunga (26 years old), Lobsang Tenzin (23 years old), Lobsang Phendey (37 years old), Jampa Yonten (30 years old), Sanggey (29 years old), Jampa Tsering (28 years old), Lobsang Wangchuk (30 years old), Lobsang Tashi (21 years old), Gendun Choephel (30 years old), Dargye (37 years old), Gedhun (29 years old), Jampa (40 years old) and Amdo Gyaltsen (41 years old), were also arrested after staging a similar peaceful protest march at Lithang main market square. Sonam Tenpa, who led the peaceful protest, was reportedly carrying a huge portrait of the Dalai Lama adorned with a traditional Tibetan scarf, while the group chanted slogans, “Long Live the Dalai Lama, Independence for Tibet”, “Swift return of the Dalai Lama to Tibet” and “ No Losar (Tibetan New Year) celebration this year”. According to the information, eyewitnesses to the scene reported that the group was brutally beaten, manhandled and forcibly loaded into military trucks by the Chinese PSB and PAP forces. Some of the protesters were badly bruised and injured with blood dripping from their nose, head and arms. Their current whereabouts and their conditions could not be ascertained at the time of issuing this urgent appeal.  The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned for the safety of all the above mentioned individuals, fearing that they may be subjected to ill-treatment and torture, in particular those whose whereabouts are currently unknown. OMCT is also preoccupied with regard to their arrest, as according to the information received, it seems solely based on their peaceful political and religious beliefs and the exercise of their rights to freedom of expression. OMCT recalls that China is a State party to the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment which prohibits torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. OMCT urges the authorities to conform with China’s international human rights obligations, commitments that were reaffirmed on the occasion of its election as a member of the new United Nations Human Rights Council. Actions Requested Please write to the authorities in the People’s Republic of China urging them to:   Immediately locate the whereabouts of the fifteen above mentioned individuals;  Guarantee, in all circumstances, the physical and psychological integrity of Lobsang Lhundup and the fifteen above mentioned individuals;   Guarantee immediate and unconditional access to a legal representation of their choice, their families and any medical treatment they may require;  Order their immediate release in the absence of valid legal charges that are consistent with international law and standards, or, if such charges exist, bring them before an impartial, independent, competent and fair tribunal and guarantee their procedural rights at all times;  Call upon the competent authorities to carry out a prompt, effective, thorough, independent and impartial investigation into these events, in particular the allegations of ill-treatment during the arrest, the result of which must be made public, in order to bring those responsible before a competent, independent and impartial tribunal and apply penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions as provided by law;  Ensure that adequate reparation is provided to the victims;  Guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
