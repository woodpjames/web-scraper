New information: The Observatory has been informed by “Chinese Human Rights Defenders” (CRD) about the upheld of the sentencing of Mrs. Liu Jie, an activist for the rights to complain and to seek justice, to Re-Education Through Labour (RTL). According to the information received, on February 19, 2008, Heilongjiang Re-education through Labour (RTL) Management Committee rejected Ms. Liu Jie’s application demanding an administrative review of the decision to send her to the RTL camp. Ms. Liu has decided to appeal this decision. Meanwhile, the RTL authorities have continued to delay its decision over Ms. Liu’s application for release for medical treatment. According to a doctor who examined her on December 20, 2007, Ms. Liu will go blind if she does not receive proper treatment immediately. As the treatment is unavailable in Heilongjiang Province, she must be urgently sent to Beijing. However, the authorities have refused to consider her application, on the grounds that they have not received the doctor’s report confirming her illness. Despite close to being blind, Ms. Liu is forced to work fourteen hours a day, six days a week at the camp.  The Observatory expresses its deep concern about the arbitrary detention of Mrs. Liu Jie and recalls that the denial of her rights to due process, free and fair trial and legal counsel is a flagrant violation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (Article 9), which China has signed but not yet ratified, and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Articles 9-11). Her detention is also a flagrant violation of the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, in particular of its article 6c, which states that “everyone has the right, individually or in association with others, to study, discuss, form and hold opinions in the observance, both in law and in practice, of all human rights and fundamental freedoms and, through these and other appropriate means, to draw public attention to those matters”. Background information: On October 11, 2007, Mrs. Liu was arrested by Beijing police around noon as she was leaving some friends at Beijing Zhong Ding Village, near the South Train Station.She was taken to the nearby You-an Men police station where her cell phone was confiscated. Police officers then put her in a car and drove away.  She and other organisers spent the last two months surveying petitioners and collecting signatures for the open letter addressed to the leaders of the Communist Party. They collected a rather large number of signatures by petitioners from many provinces, who had been to Beijing to file complaints about their mistreatments by local officials, many of whom suffered official harassment and police brutality. Since 2003, Ms. Liu has organised petitioners every year to submit open letters addressing Chinese leaders at important meetings, such as the annual National People’s Congress, advocating legal and political reforms.Other organisers of the open letter campaign are now in hiding. On October 13, 2007, Mrs. Liu Jie was officially detained for suspicion of “instigating trouble” and “gathering crowds to disturb social order”, on the basis of Article 61 of the Criminal Procedure Law, which pertains to the initial detention of “major suspects” or “active offenders”. Her family obtained her formal detention order from the PSB of the Beian City Military Farm Bureau (Nongken). Mrs. Liu was the lead organiser of a public letter signed by 12,150 petitioners calling on the Chinese Communist Party leaders to implement political and legal reforms on the eve of the 17th Party Congress. On November 12, 2007, Mrs. Liu Jie’s husband was informed by the Beian Nongken Detention Centre that his wife was sentenced to 18 months of Re-Education Through Labour (RTL) by the Public Security Bureau (PSB) of the Beian City Military Farm Bureau (Nongken) in Heilongjiang Province.  On December 20, 2007, she applied for an administrative review of the decision to send her to RTL. Because of her activities protecting the human rights of petitioners, she has been beaten a number of times by police from Heilongjiang Provincial Nongken (Military Farm Bureau) Public Security Bureau (PSB). In March 2002, in one of such beatings, she suffered permanent eye injuries and drastically reduced vision. Between October and November 2007, while in detention, she was again beaten which caused further injuries to her eyes.  Actions requested: Please write to the authorities in the People’s Republic of China, urging them to:  Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mrs. Liu Jie, and in particular ensure that she be granted all necessary medical treatment she requires; Ensure her immediate release since her detention is arbitrary as it merely aims at sanctioning her human rights activities; Put an end to the harassment against all human rights defenders in the People’s Republic of China;  Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, Article 6c above-mentioned and Article 12.2, which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”;  Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by the People’s Republic of China.
