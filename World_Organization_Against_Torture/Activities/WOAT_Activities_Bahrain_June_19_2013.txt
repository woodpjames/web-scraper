Judicial harassment
Bahrain
June 19, 2013


 The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme
of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World
Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent intervention in the
following situation in Bahrain.
 
Description of the situation :
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the ongoing
judicial harassment faced by Mr. Mohammed Al-Maskati, President of the
Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights (BYSHR).
 
According to the information received, on June 19, 2013, Mr. Al-Maskati
appeared before the Lower Criminal Court on charges of “participation in
illegal protests” in relation to a peaceful gathering held in Manama on October
12, 2012 to call for human rights and democracy in the country[1]. At the
June-19 hearing, Mr. Al-Maskati's lawyers asked for the case file, and the
judge decided to postpone the case to July 9, 2013. Mr. Al-Maskati could face
three to six months' imprisonment.
 
On October 17, 2012, Mr. Al-Maskati had appeared before Bahrain’s public
prosecution under these same charges. He had been summoned the day before to Al
Hoora police station, where he had been kept overnight before being referred to
the Prosecutor’s office. On October 17, he was released on bail, but charges
against him have remained pending since then.
 
Previously, on September 23, 2012, Mr. Al-Maskati and other Bahraini human
rights defenders who had cooperated with the United Nations (UN) had received
threats of reprisals while they were in Geneva to participate in the 21st
session of the UN Human Rights Council. Mr. Al-Maskati was notably threatened
with death through more than a dozen anonymous phone calls[2].
 
The Observatory condemns these acts of harassment against Mr. Al-Maskati, which
seem to merely aim at sanctioning his human rights activities. The Observatory
also recalls that several human rights defenders remain in arbitrary detention
or are subject to judicial harassment in the country. 
 
Actions requested:
 
Please write to the authorities of Bahrain urging them to: 
 
i.       Guarantee in all circumstances the
physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Al-Maskati and all human rights
defenders in Bahrain;
 
ii.      Put an end to all acts of harassment -
including at the judicial level - against Mr. Al-Maskati as well as all human
rights defenders in Bahrain;
 
iii.     Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration
on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United
Nations on December 9, 1998, in particular its Article 1, which provides that
“everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to
promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and
fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, Article 11,
which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with
others, to the lawful exercise of his or her occupation or profession”, Article
12(1) that provides “everyone has the right, individually and in association
with others, to participate in peaceful activities against violations of human
rights and fundamental freedoms”, as well as Article 12.2, which provides that
“the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the
competent authorities of everyone, individually or in association with others,
against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse
discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his
or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present
Declaration”; 
 
iv.    Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and
fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards
and international instruments ratified by Bahrain.
