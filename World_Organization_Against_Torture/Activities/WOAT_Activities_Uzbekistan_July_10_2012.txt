Release
/ Ongoing arbitrary detentions
Uzbekistan
July 9, 2012
 
The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights
Defenders, a joint programme of the International Federation for Human Rights
(FIDH) and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) has received new
information in the following situation in Uzbekistan.
 
New information:
 
The
Observatory was informed of the release of Mr. Khabibulla
Okpulatov, member of the Ishtikhan regional branch
of the Human Rights Society of Uzbekistan (HRSU) in the district of Ishtikhan (Samarkand
region), while at least ten other human rights defenders remain arbitrarily
detained.
 
According
to the information received, on July 4, 2012, Mr. Khabibulla
Okpulatov was released from “severe regime” prison 64/1 in Tashkent
region, after serving his whole sentence.
 
The
Observatory welcomes the release of Mr. Okpulatov, but regrets the fact that he
was detained for more than six years on the basis of unfair proceedings marred by
a number of irregularities, in an attempt to sanction his human rights
activities. 
 
The
Observatory further deplores the ongoing arbitrary detention of several other
human rights defenders in Uzbekistan, in particular that of Messrs. Azam Formonov, Nasim Isakov, Yuldosh Rasulov, Zafar Rakhimov, Ganikhon Mamatkhanov, Gaybullo Jalilov, Solijon Abdurakhmanov, Dilmurod Saidov, Azam Turgunov, Abdurasul Hudoynazarov, which seems to merely
sanction their human rights activities in flagrant violation of the provisions
of the United Nations (UN) Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by
the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998.
 
Background
information:
 
Mr.
Okpulatov had been sentenced in October 2005 to 6 years' imprisonment for
“slander for profit or for other base motives” and “extortion with aggravating
circumstances”. The
Navoi City Criminal Court extended his sentence by 3 years and 8 days on September
 29, 2009, and then in appeal on November 26, 2009, for having supposedly violated detention centre regulations.
 
Mr.
Okpulatov had been frequently subjected to disciplinary measures (including
solitary confinement), humiliations, threats and punishment for supposed
violations of prison rules. 
 
His
health condition strongly deteriorated while in detention: he lost 20 kg, could
not use his right leg,
suffered from a serious and very painful eye condition requiring urgent medical
care. 
 
In
addition, Mr. Okpulatov was not allowed to pray or to write any letters. He was
also placed in isolation from 15 January 2012 to 15 February 2012, which led to further deterioration of his health condition.
