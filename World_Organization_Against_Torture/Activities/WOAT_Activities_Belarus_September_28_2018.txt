URGENT APPEAL - THE OBSERVATORY BLR 002 / 0918 / OBS 119Judicial harassmentBelarusSeptember 28, 2018 The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a partnership of FIDH and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in Belarus. Description of the situation: The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the judicial harassment of Ms.Alena Masliukova, member of Human Rights Centre “Viasna” in Svetlogorsk and Mr. Anatoly Zmitrovich, an environmental activist.  According to the information received, on September 24, 2018, Ms. Alena Masliukova and Mr. Anatoly Zmitrovich appeared before the Svetlogorsk District Court on charges of  “taking part in an unauthorized mass event” (Part 1 of Article 23.34 of the Code of Administrative Offences). They face up to 15 days of administrative detention. The Court announced it will render its verdict on October 3, 2018.  The charges relate to a flash-mob which took place on September 15, 2018 on a public square in Svetlogorsk to protest against the environmental damage caused by a bleached-pulp factory. The flash-mob gathered at least 150 people, many of them held green balloons and wore medical masks as symbols of clean air. During the event, police officials warned the protesters that the event was unauthorized and subject to sanctions under Article 23.34 of the Code of Administrative Offenses.   On September 14, 2018, Ms. Alena Masliukova was summoned by the District Prosecutor A. Evseenko who threatened her of prosecution in case of violation of the legislation on mass events, alleging that she was involved in the organization of a mass protest of the following day. Ms. Alena Masliukova denied every involvement in the organisation of the event.  On September 15, 2018, Mr. Anatoly Zmitrovich filed a request before the District Executive Committee of Svetlogorsk in order to organise a protest against the factory. The request was denied, arguing that another event had already been planned for that same day. Therefore, a group of activists decided to hold a flash-mob instead. Five days after the flash-mob, on September 20, 2018, Ms. Alena Masliukova and Mr. Anatoly Zmitrovich were summoned to the Svetlogorsk District Police Department, where police officer Dmitri Shpak charged them under Part 1 of Article 23.34. The two claimed that they had not participated in any unauthorised mass event. None of the other flash-mob participants are known to have been summoned. Ms. Alena Masliukova claims she observed the event in her capacity as human rights defender while  Mr. Anatoly Zmitrovich links his prosecution with the fact that it was him who submitted the application for authorisation to organise the protest that was subsequently denied. The Observatory recalls that the Belarusian legislation violates the right to peaceful assembly by prohibiting citizens to hold peaceful assemblies without authorisation. In Belarus, the authorities routinely reject requests to hold peaceful assemblies related to most societal issues, either without providing adequate reason or by imposing excessive burdens on the organisers, such as requesting organizers to ensure first medical aid during the event and to clean the venue after the protest.  The Observatory strongly condemns the judicial harassment of Ms. Alena Masliukova and Mr. Anatoly Zmitrovich which seems to be only aimed at sanctioning their peaceful human rights activities and calls on the authoritiesto drop all charges against them.  Actions requested: Please write to the authorities of Belarus, urging them to: i. Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Ms. Alena Masliukova and Mr. Anatoly Zmitrovitch, as well as ofall human rights defenders in Belarus; ii.
