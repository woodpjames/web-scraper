The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a partnership of the
World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and FIDH, requests your urgent
intervention in the following situation in Cambodia.
 
Brief
description of the situation:
 
The
Observatory has been informed by the Cambodian Center for Human
Rights (CCHR) about acts of intimidation and
harassment by local authorities against Mr. Thun Ratha, a member of the environmental rights organisation
‘Mother Nature’, following his participation in a peaceful protest opposing
sand dredging in Sa-ang District, Kandal Province. 
 
According to
the information received, on June 11, 2017, Mr. Thun Ratha participated in a
peaceful protest organised by affected villagers to oppose sand dredging by Leng Ching
Company[1]
in Sa-ang District, Kandal Province. Mr. Ratha had come to Sa-ang district to
share his anti-sand dredging campaign experience with villagers and to
prevent violation.
 
On
the same day in the evening, Raka Khpos Commune Police Chief came to the house where Mr. Ratha was staying and
asked to see his identity card. At 10.30pm, Koh Kor Village Chief, accompanied
by around 10 police officers, returned to ask for Mr. Ratha’s identity card.
Again, on the morning of June 12, 2017, around 20 police officers returned to
ask for Mr. Ratha’s identity card. On each occasion Mr. Ratha refused to
provide his identity card to the police, who told him that they wanted his ID
“to ensure his security”. 
 
The
Observatory strongly condemns the acts of intimidation against Mr. Ratha, which
only aim at punishing his legitimate human rights activities. 
 
The
Observatory recalls that several members
of the organisation ‘Mother Nature’ have faced legal action and have been
harassed and imprisoned for their campaigning against illicit sand dredging in
Koh Kong Province[2]. The
Observatory calls on the Cambodian authorities to put an end to all acts of
harassment against Mr. Ratha and all human rights defenders in Cambodia.   
 
Actions
requested:

iii. Comply with

because of erosion they blame on rampant river sand dredging.
