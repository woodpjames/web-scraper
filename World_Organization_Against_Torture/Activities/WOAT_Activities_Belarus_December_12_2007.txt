Brief description of the situation:  The Observatory has been informed by the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) about a police raid against the Belarusian Congress of Democratic Trade Unions (BKDP), the largest independent trade union organisation in Belarus.  According to the information received, on December 6, 2007, at about 8.30 pm, two militiamen from local Lenin district of Minsk, accompanied by another two persons in civilian clothes, conducted a search without any warrant in the office of the BKDP. The policemen arrested several young BKDP activists who were present in the office, printing information about a meeting of entrepreneurs, and sealed or confiscated BKDP equipment and documents. The detainees were later released but were summoned to court for alleged “hooliganism”.  The BKDP has for many years been fighting for trade union rights and freedoms, its members are regularly being harassed and discriminated and its leaders have repeatedly been arrested for their commitment to and defence of fundamental rights of workers and democracy.  The Observatory expresses its deepest concern about these events and recalls that as a Participating State of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), Belarus must conform with paragraph 8 of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly Resolution on Strengthening OSCE Engagement with Human Rights Defenders and National Human Rights Institutions[1], which states that the OSCE Participating States recognise “the need for particular attention, support and protection for human rights defenders by the OSCE, its Institutions and field operations, as well as by participating States”.  Actions requested:  The Observatory urges the authorities of Belarus to:   Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of BKDP activists and all human rights defenders in Belarus;  Drop all charges against the above-mentioned BKDP activists, as they seem to merely aim at sanctioning their human rights activities;  Put an end to all acts of harassment, including at the judicial level, against all BKDP activists as well as against all human rights defenders in Belarus;  Ensure in all circumstances that they be able to carry out their work without unjustified hindrances;  Comply with all the provisions of the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, in particular with Article 1, which provides that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, Article 6.b, which provides that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others [...] freely to publish, impart or disseminate to others views, information and knowledge on all human rights and fundamental freedoms”, as well as with Article 12.2, which states that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”;  Comply with the provisions of the Document of the Copenhagen Meeting of the 2nd Conference on the Human Dimension of the Cooperation and Security Conference in Europe (CSCE) (1990), and uphold in all circumstances the principles and provisions enshrined in the international and regional human rights instruments ratified by Belarus and which, in particular, guarantee freedoms of association, demonstration, expression and opinion, in particular the European Convention on Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights;  More generally, ensure in all circumstances the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with international and regional human rights instruments ratified by Belarus.
