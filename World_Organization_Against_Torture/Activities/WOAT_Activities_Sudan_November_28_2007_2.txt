Description of the situation: The Observatory has been informed by the Sudan Organisation Against Torture (SOAT) of the sentencing and subsequent detention of Messrs. Mahjoub Ourwa and Noureddine Madani, two independent journalists, after they denounced the abusive arrests of four other journalists. According to the information received, on November 17, 2007, a Khartoum court sentenced Mr. Mahjoub Ourwa, Chairman of the independent newspaper Al-Sudani (published in Arabic), and Mr. Noureddine Madani, the editor of this newspaper, to a fine of 10,000 Sudanese pounds (3,500 Euros) each or two months in prison. This court order was issued after a libel suit brought by the National Intelligence Service (NIS), which considered that the report published on July 20, 2007 by Messrs. Ourwa and Madani, in which they denounced the abusive arrests by the NIS of four journalists that took place in the framework of the June 13 protests against the construction of a dam in the northern Kajbar region[1], was defamatory.  Messrs. Ourwa and Madani subsequently refused to pay the fine and filed an appeal to challenge the court order. They were nonetheless arrested and taken to Khartoum’s Obdurman prison. Messrs. Ourwa and Madani could remain in detention for at least a week, until the appeal is brought to court. On November 18, 2007, Al-Sudani lawyers requested suspension of the sentence until the outcome of the appeal but as of the date of issuing this urgent appeal, no reply has been brought to this request. Actions requested: Please write to the authorities of Sudan, urging them to:  i. Guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of Messrs. Mahjoub Ourwa and Noureddine Madani; ii. Release them immediately and unconditionally, since their detention is arbitrary, as it merely aims at sanctioning their human rights activities; iii. Put an end to any act of harassment against Sudanese human rights defenders and the organisations they work in; iv. Comply with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, Article 6.b (“everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, [...] freely to publish, impart or disseminate to others views, information and knowledge on all human rights and fundamental freedoms”) and Article 12.2, which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”; v. Comply with Article 39 of the Sudanese Interim National Constitution, which guarantees freedom of expression and of the media; vi. More generally, ensure in all circumstances the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with international and regional human rights instruments ratified by Sudan.
