Brief description of the situation: The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the deportation to Nepal of the migrants' human rights defender Mr. Minod Moktan, known as Minu, a Nepalese native migrant worker who emerged as a symbolic figure defending the rights of unregistered migrant workers in South Korea. Mr. Moktan founded the “Stop Crackdown Band” along with other migrants in 2003, co-founded the Internet broadcaster of the Migrant Workers Television (MWTV), and produced two documentaries on the migrant workers' situation in South Korea. According to the information received, on October 23, 2009, at 5 pm, Mr. Minod Moktan, who had been living in the Republic of Korea for 18 years, was deported to Nepal after having been held in detention for fifteen days. On October 8, 2009, Mr. Minod Moktan was arrested by immigration officers while he was entering the MWTV building in Yongsang, Seoul, in the course of an alleged immigration raid. He was subsequently imprisoned at Hwaesong Detention Centre. The circumstances in which his arrest was undertaken did not follow the immigration raids usual procedures and seem to demonstrate it was clearly linked to his activities of defence and promotion of migrant workers’ rights. Mr. Minod Moktan's arrest came just as the Government had declared an intensification on the crackdown of undocumented migrant workers, which is scheduled to continue until December 2009. On several occasions, Mr. Minod Moktan strongly denounced the brutal nature of the crackdown and called on the Government to implement a program to legalise undocumented migrant workers. Mr. Moktan's arrest is the latest incident in a series of targeted crackdowns against migrant activists in South Korea. Since 2002, immigration officers have indeed used the cover of their authority to arrest undocumented migrants to target those involved in the defence of human rights[1]. The Observatory denounces the arbitrary detention and subsequent deportation of Mr. Minod Moktan, which seems to merely aim at sanctioning his human rights activities, and urges the South Korean authorities to comply with the relevant international norms and standards, in particular the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders. Actions requested: Please write to the authorities of the Republic of Korea asking them to:   Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of all human rights defenders in the country, and in particular migrant's rights defenders;  Put an end to all forms of harassment, legal action, and ill-treatment of human rights defenders in South Korea, including migrant's rights defenders and trade unionists, as well as any obstacles to freedoms of expression, association and assembly;  Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, and Article 12.2, which provides that the State shall “take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of his or her rights”;  More generally, ensure in all circumstances the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with international human rights instruments ratified by the Republic of Korea.
