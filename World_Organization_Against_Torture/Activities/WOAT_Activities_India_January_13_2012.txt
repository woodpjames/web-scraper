The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint 
programme of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and the International 
Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), requests your urgent intervention in the 
following situation in India.
Description of the situation:
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources of the 
arbitrary detention of and judicial harassment against Mr. Narayan Reddy, 
a leader of the Communist Party of India (CPI) who has been part of a six-year 
campaign against forcible acquisition of common lands for South Korean steel 
giant POSCO in Jagatsinghpur district, Odisha State (formerly Orissa State). The campaign is organised by a 
movement called the “POSCO Pratirodh Sangram Samiti” 
(PPSS).
 
According to the information 
received, on December 23, 2011, Mr. Narayan Reddy was 
arrested in the early morning near Japa Square in Erasama area of Jagatsinghpur district, Odisha, 
and taken to Kujang police station. He was then brought before a local court, 
which remanded him to judicial custody for two weeks after he was falsely 
charged with “murder”. As of issuing this Urgent Appeal, 
Mr. Narayan Reddy remains detained in Samagol prison, Odisha 
State.
 
On January 9, 2012, a petition for 
release on bail of Mr. Narayan Reddy was rejected by the Additional 
District Session Judge of Jagatsinghpur, Mr. Sachidananda Sahu. 

 
Mr. Reddy is reportedly being held in connection with violent 
incidents that took place on December 14, 2011 at the proposed site of the POSCO 
steel plant, following a clash between peaceful protesters against the 
construction of the coastal road connecting Paradip port to the proposed site of 
the plant and workers engaged by a contractor group, the Paradip Paribahan 
Company, to build the coastal road. One person died and 25 protesting villagers 
were seriously injured during the clashes.
 
Mr. Narayan Reddy has been leading the anti-POSCO campaign following the 
arrest of PPSS President, Mr. Abhay Sahu, on November 25, 2011, in the 
same context.
 
The Observatory condemns the arbitrary detention of and judicial 
harassment against Mr. Narayan Reddy, which seems to merely aim at sanctioning 
his peaceful activities in the framework of the campaign against the proposed 
POSCO steel plant and the related forcible acquisition of common lands farmed by 
villagers.
 
Actions requested:
 
Please write to the authorities of India, urging them 
to:

integrity of Messrs. Narayan Reddy and Abhay Sahu, of all PPSS members as well as of all human rights 
defender sin India;
 
ii.

merely sanction his human rights activities;
 
iii.

judicial level – against Messrs. Narayan Reddy and Abhay Sahu as well as against all human rights defenders in 
India;

individually and in association with others, to participate in peaceful 
activities against violations of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms”;
-          Article 12.2 (“the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure 
the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in 
association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de

arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the 
rights referred to in the present Declaration”);
