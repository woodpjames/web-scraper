New Information: The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Human Rights Centre of Azerbaijan (HRCA), a member of the OMCT network, that Mr. Natik Efendiyev was sentenced by the Dashkesan Regional Court to 5 years imprisonment on 7 September 2006. He was found guilty of “illegal possession of fire-arm” under article 228.2 of the Criminal Code.   According to the information received, the accusations of plotting a coup d’état were lifted (See below).  Mr. Natik Efendiyev is the former Head of the police department of Gyandja, and the Deputy Chairman of the opposition Azerbaijan Democratic Party. He is a former political prisoner who received a pardon from the President in 2004. Brief reminder of the situation:The International Secretariat of OMCT was previously informed by HRCA that on 17 October 2005 Mr. Natik Efendiyev, along with Mr. Etibar Guliyev, were arrested.  Mr. Etibar Guliyev was sentenced to 2.5 years imprisonment on charges of plotting a coup d’état. Mr. Quliyev is a member of the Azerbaijan Democratic Party and a former political prisoner pardoned by the President in 2004. He was detained in the Department of Organised Crimes and had limited access to his lawyer. His case was heard in the Department of Organised Crimes, instead of in court as required by the Azerbaijani law.  As regards Mr. Natik Efendiyev, he was charged with plotting a coup d’état, reportedly due to his close relationship to Mr. Rasul Guliyev, leader of the Democratic Party of Azerbaijan. Mr. Rasul Guliyev has been accused of embezzlement, charges which seem to be politically motivated. Mr. Guliyev has been living in the United States for several years and declared that he would return to Azerbaijan to run in the presidential elections. The Prosecutor General had said that he would be immediately arrested and jailed if he returned to Azerbaijan. (See also Case AZE 031105 relating to the arrest of Prof. Eldar Salayev).  While in detention, Mr. Natik Efendiyev was allegedly beaten as well as electrocuted and consequently hospitalised in Baku after which he was held at the Organised Crime Unit of the Interior Ministry. Later, he was transferred to Bayil Prison of the Ministry of Justice, where detention conditions are slightly better. Nevertheless, he remained in relative isolation (he had access to his lawyer but family members were not allowed to visit). Furthermore, just as in the case of Mr. Guliyev, Mr. Efendiyev’s case was heard in the Department of Organised Crimes, instead of in court as required by the Azerbaijani law. Action requested:Please continue to write to the authorities in Azerbaijan urging them to: i.	Take all necessary measures to guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Etibar Guliyev and Mr. Natik Efendiyev; ii.	Order the immediate release of Mr. Etibar Guliyev and Mr. Natik Efendiyev and the annulment of the illegally obtained convictions; iii.	Should legitimate grounds for prosecution remain, order a retrial before a properly constituted court of law in which Mr. Etibar Guliyev and Mr. Natik Efendiyev procedural rights to a fair and impartial hearing are guaranteed at all times; iv.	Order a thorough and impartial investigation into the circumstances of these events, in particular the reports of torture, in order to identify those responsible, bring them to trial and apply the penal and/or administrative sanctions as provided by law; v.	Guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with international human rights standards.
