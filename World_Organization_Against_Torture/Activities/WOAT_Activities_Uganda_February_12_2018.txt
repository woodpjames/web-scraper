Break in / Assault
Uganda
February 12, 2018

The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a
partnership of FIDH and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT),
requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in Uganda.
 
Description
of the situation:
 
The Observatory has
been informed by reliable sources about the break-in of the Human Rights
Awareness and Promotion Forum (HRAPF)’s premises[1].

 
According to the information
received, at around 3 am on February 9, 2018, about nine unidentified
individuals attempted to break-in into HRAPF’s premises, cut power to the
building, disabled parts of the security system and assaulted two security
guards on duty with iron bars and batons. They both sustained severe injuries,
including a skull fracture to one of them. The individuals left the premises
after HRAPF’s security providers came, and failed to take anything from HRAPF’s
offices.
 
The Observatory recalls that it is
the second time in less than two years that HRAPF’s premises are suffering such
gruesome attack. Already, on May 22, 2016, four unidentified individuals scaled
the fence of the HRAPF premises and suffocated the security guard to death[2].
To date, no effective police investigation lead to those responsible being
brought before a court of justice. Rather, a mere police report classifying the
attack as a random attack was provided.
 
The Observatory expresses its utmost
concern over the break-in into HRAPF’s premises and the assault of its security
guards, and fears that this would be the latest illustration of a series of
targeted attacks against human rights defenders and organisations in Uganda in
a context of prevailing impunity[3].
 
The Observatory calls for an immediate,
thorough, transparent investigation into both of the above-mentioned incidents
at HRAPF’s premises, as well as into all the other break-ins, thefts, and acts
of violence against NGOs and human rights defenders in Uganda, in order to
identify all those responsible, bring them before an independent tribunal, and to
apply them the sanctions provided by the law.
 
The Observatory urges Ugandan
authorities to guarantee the respect for freedom of association and to prevent
any hindrance or reprisals against the work of human rights defenders and
organisations.
 
Actions requested:
 
Please write to the authorities
in Uganda asking them to:
 
      
i.        
Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and
psychological integrity of HRAPF representatives and related personnel, as well
as all human rights defenders in Uganda;
 
     
ii.        
Order an immediate, thorough, transparent investigation into
both of the above-mentioned incidents at HRAPF’s premises and the related
break-in, and all the other above-mentioned break-ins, thefts and acts of
violence against NGOs and human rights defenders in Uganda, in order to
identify all those responsible, bring them before an independent tribunal, and
apply them the sanctions provided by the law;
 
    
iii.        
Guarantee in all circumstances that human rights defenders
and organisations in Uganda are able to carry out their legitimate human rights
activities without fear of reprisals;
 
    iv.        
Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human
Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December
9, 1998, especially its Articles 1, 5 and 12.2;
 
    
v.        
Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights
and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights
standards and international instruments ratified by Uganda.
