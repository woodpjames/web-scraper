URGENT APPEAL - THE OBSERVATORY
 
TUR 003 / 1111 / OBS 121
Arbitrary detention / Judicial harassment
Turkey
November 3, 2011
 
The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint 
programme of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World 
Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent intervention in the 
following situation in Turkey.
 
Description of the situation:
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the 
arbitrary detention of Mr. Ragıp Zarakolu, Honorary Board Member and Founder of the 
Human Rights Association (İHD), Director of the Belge Publishing House and Chairman 
of the Publishers Association Freedom 
to Publish Committee of Turkey,
and Ms. Büşra Ersanlı, lecturer at the Marmara University Faculty of 
Political Sciences and International Relations in Istanbul, in the framework of a wide ranged anti-terrorist operation intended 
to dismantle an alleged terrorist network - the Kurdish Communities Union (KCK) - that in fact targets peaceful activists from the Kurdish community 
who are not related to any terrorist activities. 
 
According to the information received, on October 28, 2011, Mr. Ragıp 
Zarakolu and Ms. Büşra Ersanlı were 
both arrested in Istanbul as part of a vast operation that targeted more than 48 
people, mostly Kurdish political activists and particularly members of the Peace 
and Democracy Party (BDP). On November 1, 2011, the two were officially charged 
with “being a member of an illegal organisation”, namely the KCK - an 
organisation said to be the “urban branch” of the armed Kurdistan Workers Party 
(PKK) - under Article 314 of the Turkish Penal Code by İstanbul Heavy Penal 
Court No. 14.
As of issuing this Urgent Appeal, Mr. Ragıp Zarakolu is detained in Metris prison while Ms. Büşra Ersanlı is detained in Bakırköy closed prison for females. They both have 
access to their lawyer and family.
 
Mr. Ragıp Zarakolu is a well known human rights activist since the 
1970s and has particularly focused on freedom of expression and minorities' 
rights. Through the Belge Publishing 
House, he has published numerous books on the repression of national 
minorities in Turkey and on the Armenian Genocide and has been subjected to 
arbitrary detention and judicial harassment on numerous occasions. Ms. Büşra Ersanlı has been engaged with NGOs for political rights of the 
women.
 
The Observatory denounces the continuing policy of arbitrarily 
arresting human rights defenders in Turkey, and particularly İHD members, 
members of trade unions and those fighting against the impunity of serious 
crimes and calling for a peaceful resolution of the Kurd question, which seems 
to merely aim at sanctioning their human rights activities. To that extent, the 
Observatory recalls that several İHD members are currently in pre-trial 
detention, notably Mr. Muharrem Erbey, İHD General Vice Chairperson and 
Chairperson of its Diyarbakir Province branch who had been detained since 
December 2009, Mr. Arslan Özdemir and Ms. Roza Erdede, İHD members 
in Diyarbakır[1], as well as 
members and executives of İHD Şanlıurfa Branch, the Education and Science 
Workers Trade Union (Egitim-Sen), the Health and Social Service Workers Trade 
Union (SES)[2] and members of 
associations of families of victims of abusive anti-terrorism policies[3]. Dozens of other 
human rights defenders remain in provisional release pending the outcome of 
criminal trials on alleged terrorism charges. 
 
Accordingly, the Observatory calls upon the Turkish authorities to 
put an end to the continuing harassment against human rights defenders and urges 
the Turkish authorities to release all human rights defenders currently held in 
detention immediately and unconditionally, since their detention is arbitrary as 
it only aim at sanctioning their human rights activities.
 
Actions requested:

integrity of Mr. Ragıp Zarakolu and Ms. Büşra Ersanlı, as well as Mr. Muharrem Erbey, Mr. Arslan Özdemir and Ms. Roza

and members of associations of families of victims of abusive anti-terrorism 
policies, and in general, all human rights defenders in Turkey;
 
ii. Release Mr. Ragıp Zarakolu and Ms. Büşra Ersanlı, as well as Mr. Muharrem Erbey, Mr. Arslan Özdemir and Ms. Roza 
Erdede as well as all other members of İHD, Egitim-Sen and SES Şanlıurfa Branch 
and members of associations of families of victims of abusive anti-terrorism 
policies, immediately and unconditionally since their detention is arbitrary as 
it only aim at sanctioning their human rights activities;
 
iii. Put an end to all acts harassment, including at the judicial level, 
against Mr. Ragıp Zarakolu and Ms. Büşra Ersanlı, as well as Mr. Muharrem Erbey, Mr. Arslan Özdemir and Ms. Roza 
Erdede as well as all other members of İHD, Egitim-Sen and SES Şanlıurfa Branch 
and members of associations of families of victims of abusive anti-terrorism 
policies and, in general, all human rights defenders in Turkey;
 
iv. Comply with the provisions of the United Nations Declaration on 
Human Rights Defenders, especially its Article 1, which states that “everyone 
has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to 
strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms at the national and international levels”, as well as Article 12.2, 
which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the 
protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in 
association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or 
de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a 
consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the 
present Declaration” ;
 
v. More generally, ensure in all circumstances the respect for human 
rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international and regional
