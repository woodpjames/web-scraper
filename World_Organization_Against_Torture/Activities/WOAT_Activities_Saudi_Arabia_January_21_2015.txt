The referral took place before January 9, 2015, when he received 50 lashes in public outside Al-Jafali mosque in Jeddah (see background information).The Observatory urges the Saudi authorities to immediately overturn the entire sentence against Mr. Raif Badawi, and reiterates its condemnation in the strongest terms of the use of corporal punishment as a criminal sanction and recalls that Saudi Arabia has adhered to the Convention Against Torture in 1997, which prohibits torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.The Observatory calls on the Saudi authorities to immediately release Raif Badawi, as his conviction is aimed at preventing him from carrying out his legitimate and peaceful human rights activities in Saudi Arabia.Background information:In 2006, Mr. Raif Badawi created the website Free Saudi Liberals. This liberal blog promoted freedom of expression and fostered public debate about religion in Saudi Arabia. Since then he has been the subject of continuous judicial harassment.On June 17, 2012, Mr. Raif Badawi was arrested and placed in the Jeddah prison on charges of “apostasy” – an offence punishable by death penalty in Saudi Arabia – and “setting up an illegal website”.In July 2013, the website was closed by the authorities.On July 29, 2013, Mr. Raif Badawi was sentenced to seven years in jail and 600 lashes by the District Court in Jeddah. The verdict cleared him from the capital sentence encompassed by the charge of apostasy. With the help of his lawyer, he appealed against his conviction.On December 12, 2013, the Court of Appeals quashed the first instance verdict and sent the case back to retrial.On May 7, 2014, the Jeddah Criminal Court handed down a harsher sentence by increasing the prison term to 10 years and the number of lashes to 1,000 together with a 10-year travel ban to start on expiration of his jail sentence and a fine of one million Saudi Riyals (200,000 €) for “insulting Islam and religious authorities”.On September 1, 2014, the Jeddah Court of Appeal upheld the sentence issued against him. The Ministry of Interior gave orders for Raif Badawi to receive the 1000 lashes over 20 weeks in public outside Al-Jafali mosque in Jeddah during 20 sessions of 50 lashes each.On January 9, 2015, Mr. Raif Badawi received 50 lashes outside Al-Jafali mosque in Jeddah.Actions requested:Please write to the authorities in Saudi Arabia asking them to:i.               Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Raif Badawi, as well as all human rights defenders in Saudi Arabia, specifically by suspending the pending sessions of lashes;ii.              Quash the conviction and sentencing of Mr. Raif Badawi, which only serves to prevent him from carrying out his peaceful human rights work, and release him immediately and unconditionally, as well as all human rights defenders arbitrarily detained in Saudi Arabia;iii.            Put an end to all acts of harassment and intimidation, including at the judicial level, against Mr. Raif Badawi and all human rights defenders in Saudi Arabia, and ensure in all circumstances that they are able to carry out their work without unjustified hindrance and fear of reprisal;iv.             Put an end to the use of corporal punishment as a criminal sanction in order to comply with its international human rights obligations.v.              Comply in all circumstances with all the provisions of the United Nations Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, adopted by consensus by the UN General Assembly on December 9, 1998, in particular its:-   Article 1, which provides that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”;-   Article 6(a), which foresees that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to participate in peaceful activities against violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms”;-   Article 12.2, which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”;vi.             Comply with the provisions of the Arab Charter, in particular its article 32 which protects  “the right to information, freedom of opinion and freedom of expression, freedom to seek, receive and impart information by all means, regardless of frontiers”.vii.           More generally, ensure in all circumstances the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, ratify international and regional human rights instruments and harmonise its domestic law with international human rights instruments.Addresses:· His Majesty, King Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud, King of Saudi Arabia and Custodian of the two Holy Mosques, Office of His Majesty the King, Royal Court, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
