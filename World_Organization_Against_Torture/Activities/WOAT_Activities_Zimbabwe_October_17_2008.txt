Brief description of the situation: The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about new acts of harassment against members of Women of Zimbabwe Arise (WOZA) and Men of Zimbabwe Arise (MOZA), as well as the arbitrary detention of two WOZA members following a peaceful march and a sit-in in Bulawayo. According to the information received, on October 16, 2008, WOZA organised a peaceful march through the streets of Bulawayo in order to denounce the alarming economic and social situation and to demand food for all Zimbabweans. This demonstration took place as the political deadlock continues a month after the power-sharing agreement was signed and the crisis facing people in their daily lives deteriorates dramatically every day. WOZA was therefore demanding immediate action regarding the formation of a new government that will begin to work on solving urgent social issues, like food, electricity and water. Recognising that the situation in the country is now a “national disaster”, they also demanded that all Zimbabweans receive access to food aid and also seed and agricultural inputs. On arrival at the Mhlahlandlela Government Complex, the group of approximately 200 sat down outside the gates whilst a delegation of four elderly women went in to request that the Regional Department Heads of all the service departments come out and address the crowd on what was being done to alleviate the humanitarian crisis facing the country. The group sat peacefully for 45 minutes, waiting to be addressed, before five riot police approached the group. Ms. Jennifer Williams and Ms. Magadonga Mahlangu, two WOZA leaders, were then arrested and taken to Drill Hall. The rest of the group were forcibly dispersed and beaten with baton sticks. At least one member is receiving medical attention for the beating she received. Ms. Williams and Ms. Mahlangu were later taken to Bulawayo Central Police Station, where they were currently being held as of issuing this urgent appeal. No information could be obtained regarding the charges against them, as their lawyers were denied access by the Officer-in-Charge of the Law and Order Section in Bulawayo Central, Detective Chief Inspector Ntini. On October 17, 2008, Ms. Williams and Ms. Mahlangu were remanded in custody until October 21, 2008 by the Bulawayo Magistrate’s Court. They were charged for “disturbing the peace, security or order of the public” under Section 37 1(a) of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act. Ms. Williams and Ms. Mahlangu were denied bail under the pretext that there would still be another outstanding case pending against them[1]. Yet, as they had been removed off remand following a Harare Magistrate’s Court decision on October 15, 2008, they argue that their case is no longer pending. The Magistrate Maphosa allowed the State time to verify this fact however, remanding the two in custody until October 21. Ms. Williams and Ms. Mahlangu are to be transferred to Bulawayo Remand Prison later this afternoon for the night. It is not clear if they will then be moved to Mlondolozi Female Prison tomorrow or if they will remain at Bulawayo Prison until October 21. The Observatory notes that Ms. Mahlangu suffers from the beatings she received outside Mhlalandlela, reportedly inflicted from the Chief Inspector called Mabhari. The Observatory expresses its deep concern about the arbitrary detention of Ms. Jennifer Williams and Ms. Magadonga Mahlangu, as well as about the ongoing acts of harassment against them and all WOZA/MOZA members. The Observatory further recalls that according to Article 1 of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, and that Article 6(c) of the Declaration provides that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others [...] to study, discuss, form and hold opinions on the observance, both in law and in practice, of all human rights and fundamental freedoms and, through these and other appropriate means, to draw public attention to those matters”. Actions required: Please write to the authorities of Zimbabwe urging them to:   Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Ms. Jennifer Williams, Ms. Magodonga Mahlangu, all WOZA/MOZA activists, defenders of economic, social and cultural rights as well as of all human rights defenders in Zimbabwe;  Release immediately and unconditionally Ms. Jennifer Williams and Ms. Magodonga Mahlangu since their detention is arbitrary as it merely aims at sanctioning their human rights activities;  Order a thorough and impartial investigation into the above-mentioned allegations of ill-treatments in order to identify all those responsible, bring them to trial and apply the penal and/or administrative sanctions as provided by law;  Put an end to all kinds of harassment, including at the judicial level, against all human rights defenders in Zimbabwe;  Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its above-mentioned Article 1 and Article 6(c) as well as Article 12.2, which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the [...] Declaration”;  Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by Zimbabwe.
