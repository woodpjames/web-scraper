The International
Secretariat of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) requests your URGENT
intervention in the following situation in Indonesia.
Brief
description of the situation
The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by TAPOL, a member organisation
of OMCT SOS-Torture Network, about the arbitrary detention and ill-treatment of
Mr. Yohanes Boseren a 20-year-old
man. OMCT has also been informed about his poor health resulting from the ill-treatment
he suffered under arrest and the lack of adequate medical treatment. 
According to the information
received, on 1 May 2013 Mr. Yohanes Boseren was arrested with five other men,
Oktovianus Warnares, Yoseph Arwakon, Markus Sawias, George Syors Simyapen and
Jantje Wamaer during a peaceful flag-raising ceremony in Biak to commemorate the
50th anniversary of the administrative transfer of Papua to
Indonesia in 1963. They were detained in Biak prison facing charges of treason under
Article 106[1]
of the Indonesian Criminal Code and possession of ammunitions and explosives
under the Emergency Law 12/1951. Local reports indicate that the police
fabricated evidence consisting of bullets and home-made bombs in order to
charge them with these crimes. 
According to the same information received,
Mr. Yohanes Boseren was severely beaten under arrest causing him a traumatic
head injury. On 14 November 2013, Mr. Yohanes Boseren was brought to Abepura
Mental Health Hospital, where he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress
disorder and a form of organic mental disorder due to the beatings he had
suffered during his arrest. However, he was returned to Biak prison two days
later. 
Mr. Yohanes Boseren’s trial has been
temporarly suspended due to his condition. The Public Prosecutor reportedly
stated during the hearing that they would coordinate between the prison
authorities and doctors at Abepura Mental Health Hospital to provide medial
supplies for Mr. Yohanes Borseren. His lawyers have submitted an appeal for
consideration, reasoning that Mr. Borseren should be released from prison and
given treatment at Abepura Mental Health Hospital due to the limited medical
facilities in Biak prison to which the judge reportedly agreed. However, at the
moment of issuing this urgent appeal, Mr. Yohanes Boseren was still detained in
Biak prison. 
The
International Secretariat of OMCT expresses its deep concern about the safety
and physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Yohanes Boseren and urges
the competent authorities to guarantee his safety at all times by immediately
transferring him to Abepura Mental Health Hospital where he can receive
adequate medical care. 
OMCT recalls that Indonesia is legally bound to
effectively ensure the physical and psychological integrity of all persons
deprived of liberty in accordance with international human rights law, and in
particular the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or
Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights and the UN Body of Principles for the Protection of All
Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment.
Furthermore, OMCT
urges the competent authorities to carry out a prompt, effective, thorough, independent and impartial
investigation into the allegations of ill-treatment and arbitrary arrest,
in accordance with international human rights standards, the result of which
must be made public, in order to bring those responsible before a competent,
independent and impartial tribunal and apply penal, civil and/or administrative
sanctions as provided by law. 
OMCT also urges the Indonesian authorities to amend
the Indonesian Criminal Code to ensure that no one is prosecuted for treason
for exercising their rights to peaceful assembly and freedom of expression
protected under the Indonesian constitution and international law. 
In this regard, OMCT recalls the concluding
observations formulated to Indonesia by the UN Human Rights Committee in 2013,
notably the following one: 
“In line with the Committee’s general comment No. 34,
the State party should take the necessary steps to ensure that any restrictions
to the freedom of expression comply fully with the strict requirements of
article 19, paragraph 3, of the Covenant, as further clarified in general
comment No. 34. The State party should ensure the enjoyment by all of the
freedom of peaceful assembly and protect protesters from harassment,
intimidation and violence. The State party should consistently investigate such
cases and prosecute those responsible.”(CCPR/C/IDN/CO/1 para 28)
