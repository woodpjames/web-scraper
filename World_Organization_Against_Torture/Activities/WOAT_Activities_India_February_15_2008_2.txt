Brief description of the situation The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Centre for Organisation Research & Education (CORE), a member of OMCT SOS-Torture network, of the forced disappearance of Mr. Abi Chiru, 18-year-old, resident of Uran Chiru Village, Senapati District, in Manipur since 27 January 2008. According to the information received, on 27 January 2008 at around 3:00 p.m., Mr. Abi Chiru was arrested along with his uncle, Mr. Nungshipa, by personnel of the 24th BN, Assam Rifles stationed at Moreh, when they were trying to enter Moreh Gate No.2, at the Indo-Myanmar border. Both had reportedly gone to Moreh for shopping. The reasons of their arrest remain as of now unclear. While Mr. Nungshipa was subsequently released after a brief interrogation, Mr. Abi Chiru was allegedly detained. Mr. Nungshipa reportedly got home and informed Mr. Abi Chiru’s family of his arrest. His family along with an organisation started searching for him and inquired before the Moreh Police and some army officials but without success. Mr. Abi Chiru’s whereabouts remain since then unknown. The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned for the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Abi Chiru, as his whereabouts remain unknown, giving rise to fears that he may be subjected to ill-treatment, torture or potentially extra-judicial execution. OMCT calls on the authorities to immediately locate his whereabouts and guarantee his personal integrity at all times. Action requested Please write to the authorities in India urging them to:   Immediately locate the whereabouts of Mr. Abi Chiru and guarantee, in all circumstances, his physical and psychological integrity;  Order his immediate release in the absence of valid legal charges, and if such charges exist, ensure that he is given a prompt and fair trial, in which his procedural rights are guaranteed at all times;  Order a thorough and impartial investigation into these events in order to identify all those responsible, bring them to trial and apply the penal and/or administrative sanctions as provided by law;  Ensure respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standard.
