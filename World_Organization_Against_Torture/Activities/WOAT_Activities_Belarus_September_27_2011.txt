Harassment / Ongoing arbitrary detention
Belarus

The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint 
programme of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World 
Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), has received new information and requests 
your intervention in the following situation in Belarus.
 
New information:
 
The Observatory has been informed of the arbitrary arrest of and acts 
of harassment against Mr. Uladzimir Labkovich, legal adviser of the Human 
Rights Centre “Viasna”, following a peaceful gathering organised in support with 
Mr. Ales Bialatski, President of Viasna and Vice-President of FIDH, who 
currently remains in pre-trial detention (See background 
information).
 
According to the information received, on September 25, 2011, Mr. 
Uladzimir Labkovich was arbitrarily arrested and detained following a picket 
organised on the same day in solidarity with Mr. Ales Bialatski, on the occasion 
of his 49th birthday. The picket started near the central post 
office, where demonstrators holding birthday cards and balloons gathered to then 
walk to the detention centre where Mr. Ales Bialatski is detained. In front of 
the building, the group shouted “Happy birthday, Ales Bialatski!” and released 
the balloons, in sign of support with the detainee. After this action, Mr. 
Uladzimir Labkovich went to the Minsk Hotel to meet with Mr. Bialatski's lawyer 
and was approached by a police colonel for an ID identification. Outside the 
hotel, he was pushed into a car without registration plates and driven to the 
Maskouski District Police Department. There, he was interrogated on the reasons 
of the gathering organised before the detention centre. Three hours later, after 
having signed a written document explaining the reasons of the gathering, he was 
released without charge. 
 
In the past weeks, the Belarusian authorities have banned several 
pickets organised in support with Mr. Ales Bialatski, notably on August 16, 17, 
19, 23, and 24. 
 
Background information:
 
On August 4, 2011, Mr. Bialatski was arrested in the street by the 
police representative of the Department of Financial Investigations. 

 
On the same day, a search was carried out by the police in Mr. 
Bialatski’s house. At the same time, other police officers were waiting before 
Viasna's offices, where Mr. Bialatski was then brought after the search of his 
home was finished, for the search of the offices. Several documents and a 
computer were confiscated. On August 5, 2011, Mr. Bialatski was transferred to a 
cell within the Financial Investigation Department of the State Control 
Committee, before being remanded in prison for ten days in the detention centre 
of the Interior Ministry.
 
On August 14, 2011, the detention of Mr. Ales Bialatski was extended 
by two months by decision of the Prosecutor, after Mr. Bialatski was officially 
charged under Article 243 part 2 of the Criminal Code for “concealment of 
profits on an especially large scale” on August 12. 
 
As of issuing this Urgent Appeal, Mr. Bialatski remains detained in 
the pre-trial detention centre of the Interior Ministry.
 
This criminal case was opened by the Belarusian authorities on the 
basis of information related to Mr. Bialatski's bank account, registered at DnB 
NORDs bank in Vilnius, Lithuania. The Belarusian tax authorities interpreted the 
amount on the account of Mr. Bialatski as his personal income and accused him of 
concealing it. In reality, this money, which was transferred by international 
organisations, was by no means used as personal funds but to finance the 
legitimate human rights activities of Viasna, such as assistance provided to 
victims of the political repression in the post-electoral context. 

 
It is indeed only because Belarusian independent human rights 
organisations, including Viasna, are confronted with systematic refusals of 
registration, and because Article 193.1 of the Criminal Code of Belarus 
criminalises activities “as part of an unregistered organisation”, that the 
funds dedicated to the human rights activities of Viasna had to be transferred 
on this Lithuanian bank account.
 
Actions requested:
 
The Observatory urges the authorities of Belarus to:
 
i. Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological 
integrity of Mr. Ales Bialatski, Mr. Uladzimir Labkovich as well as of all human 
rights defenders in Belarus and their families;
 
ii. Release Mr. Ales Bialatski immediately and unconditionally since 
his detention is arbitrary as it seems to merely sanction his human rights 
activities; 
 
iii. Put an end to all forms of harassment against them, and more 
generally against all human rights defenders in the 
country;
 
iv. Comply with all the provisions of the United Nations Declaration 
on Human Rights Defenders, in particular:  

- "to promote and to strive for the protection and realization of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels" 
(Article 1);
- "to form, join and participate in non-governmental organizations, 
associations or groups" and "to communicate with non-governmental or 
intergovernmental organizations" (Article 5(b) and (c));
 
- "to solicit, receive and utilize resources for the express purpose 
of promoting and protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms through 
peaceful means" (Article 13);
 
v. More generally, ensure in all circumstances the respect for human 
rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights and with international and regional human rights instruments 
ratified by Belarus.
