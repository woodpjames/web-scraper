In preparation to the session of the Committee Against Torture, OMCT supported the work of the Coordinadora de Solidaridad con las Personas Presas which presented a report to the Committee that was the result of a collaboration of the following Spanish organizations: Asociación Apoyo (Madrid); Asociación Contra la Tortura; Asociación Libre de Abogados; Aspas (Madrid); Asamblea de Entrevías (Madrid); Asociación Pro Derechos Humanos de Andalucía; Centro de Documentación sobre la Tortura; Colectivo de Jóvenes de la Coma (Valencia); Comité Anti-Sida de Salamanca; Coordinadora de Barrios de Madrid; Coordinadora Contra la Marginación de Cornellá; Madres Unidas Contra la Droga (Madrid);  Nais en Loita (Galicia); Plataforma de Grupos de Suports a Presos i Preses (Barcelona); PreSOS- Galiza; Salhaketa.  A report on violence against women in Spain was also submitted by OMCT.   OMCT invited representatives of the Coordinadora to come to Geneva to participate in an NGO briefing to the Committee.   In their report and during the briefing to the Committee, representatives of the Coordinadora highlighted, among others, the following concerns: the fact that reports of ill-treatment and torture both in police custody and in prisons, are common in Spain and not isolated instances as was claimed by the authorities in their report to the Committee; the enormous difficulties including reprisals, faced by those who attempt to denounce torture and ill-treatment whether these be the victims, lawyers, NGOs or police officers and prison officials; the legal shortcomings and administrative and other practices which lead to and ensure impunity.   The Committee Against Torture recommended, among others:  ·	That the government take measures to avoid racist and xenophobic incidents and that the provision in the Criminal Code which defines torture be amended so that it better addresses such cases; ·	That the government consider allowing detainees kept incommunicado the possibility of being examined by a forensic doctor together with a doctor of his or her choice; ·	A reminder of Spain’s obligation to carry out prompt and impartial investigations and try  alleged perpetrators of human rights violations, in particular torture.   After receiving the Committee’s Conclusions and Recommendations the representative of the Spanish government declared that the contradiction between information presented by NGOs and the government regarding numbers of allegations of torture in Spain are of concern to the  government and invited the members of the Committee to carry out an onsite visit to the country.  OMCT would like to urge the government of Spain to carefully consider the Conclusions and Recommendations of the UN Committee Against Torture and to adopt all necessary measures so as to ensure that Spain complies with its obligations under the Convention against Torture.  _______________________________________   For copies of the alternative report by the Coordinadora (in Spanish) or for further information please contact OMCT at + 41 22 809 49 39  or e-mail:  omct@omct.org
