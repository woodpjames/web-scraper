Brief description of the situation:The Observatory has been informed by the Georgian Young Lawyers’ Association (GYLA) about the threats against Ms. Lela Bekauri, member of the Rustavi branch office of the GYLA.  According to the information received, on September 21, 2006, the Georgian Young Lawyers’ Association held a conference in its office in Rustavi, which was entitled “Deficiencies during pre-election troubles in Georgian regions”. During the briefing, Ms. Lela Bekauri pointed out the deficiencies that appeared during the campaign of the Rustavi majority candidate, Ms. Lela Aptsiauri, who distributed to the population vouchers worth to 37 kilowatts of electricity as part of her pre-election campaign.  A couple of hours after the press conference, an unidentified man called Ms. Lela Bekauri on her phone at home, insulting and threatening her, in particular by saying that he would “catch [her] wherever”.  Following these events, GYLA asked the authorities to carry out an investigation into these threats, but they have not received any reply yet.  The Observatory expresses its concern about these threats, which seem to be only intended to intimidate Ms.  Lela Bekauri and to prevent her from carrying out her work in favour of democracy and the rule of law in Georgia. Actions requested: Please write to the authorities in Georgia urging them to: i.	Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Ms. Lela Bekauri, as well as of all human rights defenders in Georgia;  ii.	Conduct a fair, independent and impartial inquiry into those threats in order to identify their authors, bring them to justice and sanction them according to law;  iii.	Put an end to acts of harassment against Ms. Lela Bekauri as well as against all human rights defenders in Georgia;  iv.	Comply with the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, in particular article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, article 5c, which provides the right “to communicate with non-governmental or intergovernmental organisations”, and article 12.2, which declares that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually or in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”;  v.	More generally, ensure in all circumstances the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights instruments ratified by Georgia.
