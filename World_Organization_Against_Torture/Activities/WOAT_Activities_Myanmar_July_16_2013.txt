The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of
the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation
Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent intervention in the following
situation in Burma.
 
Brief
description of the situation:
 
The
Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the
arrest of Mr. Wai Phyo, Secretary of Generation Wave, a network of human
rights defenders that campaigns for civil and political rights, including the
signature of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights by Burma,
in relation to his participation in a “Free Political Prisoners” poster
campaign organised in July 2011 in several cities.
 
According to the information received, on July 10, 2013, Mr. Wai Phyo
was arrested by the Chief of Pyay township police station for offences under the
1962 Printing and Publications Registrations Act for distributing unlawful
printed documents in Pyay in July 2011. The police took him to Pyay Township
Court and asked the court to detain him for interrogation for two weeks. On July
12, Mr. Wai Phyo was taken to court again where his lawyer requested bail. The
judge denied the request and gave the next court date of July 25. Mr. Wai Phyo
is currently detained at Pyay Prison. He has access to his lawyer and family.
 
The Observatory recalls
that two other members of Generation Wave, Messrs. Zar Ni and Wai
Phyo Aung, were arrested in July 2011 in relation to the above-mentioned
poster campaign and sentenced to three months of imprisonment and a 30,000
Kyats (23.4 Euros) fine in February 2012. The court did not count that they had
already been detained for seven months by the time of the trial, so they paid
30,000 Kyats each and were released. At the time, an arrest warrant was also
issued against Mr. Wai Phyo, who led the poster campaign in Pyay, but managed
to escape the arrest.

The Observatory condemns Mr. Wai Phyo’s arrest and judicial harassment,
which seems to merely aim at sanctioning his peaceful human rights activities. 
 
Actions
requested:
 
Please
write to the authorities of Burma, urging them to:
 
i.              
Guarantee in all circumstances
the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Wai Phyo, as well as of all human rights defenders in

ii.             
Release Mr. Wai Phyo
immediately and unconditionally since his detention is arbitrary as it seems to

any acts of harassment, including judicial harassment, against him as well as
against all human rights defenders in Burma;
 
iv.            
Comply with all the

particular with its: 
-       
Article 1, which
provides that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with
others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realization of human
rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”;
-       
Article 6(a), which
foresees that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with
others, to participate in peaceful activities against violations of human
rights and fundamental freedoms”;
-       
Article 12.2, which
provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the
protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in
association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de
facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other
arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the
rights referred to in the present Declaration”;
 
v.             
More generally, ensure
in all circumstances the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in
accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and international
human rights instruments.
