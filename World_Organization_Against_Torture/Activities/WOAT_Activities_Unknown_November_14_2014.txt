November 14, 2014 - On November 12 and 13, 2014, the United Nations (UN)
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders Michel Forst met
with representatives of regional human rights defenders' mechanisms, in the
framework of the first part of the fifth “inter-mechanisms” meeting. Enhancing
cooperation between the UN mechanism and its regional counterparts was defined
as a priority by the UN Special Rapporteur in his first report to the UN
General Assembly in October 2014.The
“inter-mechanisms meeting 5.1” gathered representatives from the UN, the
International Organisation of “La Francophonie” (OIF), the African Commission
on Human and Peoples Rights, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, the
Office of the Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe, the
OSCE/ODIHR, the European Union, as well as international NGOs. It was hosted by
the OIF headquarters in Paris, and was facilitated by the Observatory for the
Protection of Human Rights Defenders (FIDH-OMCT joint programme).Participants
reflected on ways to enhance cooperation, if not articulation, in processing
submissions and public statements about human rights defenders' violations, and
in enhancing the follow-up of individual communications and recommendations
from country visits. They further discussed best practices and strategies to
tackle the issue of arbitrary detention, particularly on emblematic cases.The meeting
also allowed for an exchange on the definition of reprisals and impunity, how
they relate to each other, and how tackling impunity through accountability
would ultimately mitigate the root-cause of reprisals.Finally,
participants had a discussion on the issue of NGO funding, including foreign
funding, as well as on the protection of land rights defenders, echoing the
topics of the 2013 and 2014 Annual Reports of the Observatory.This
meeting aimed to prepare an “inter-mechanisms meeting 5.2”, gathering
mandate-holders themselves, which the Observatory will organise during the
first quarter of 2015 at the OIF headquarters. Last but not least, FIDH and
OMCT were invited by the Office of the Commissioner for Human Rights of the
Council of Europe to hold the sixth meeting in Strasbourg, and a future meeting
in Warsaw, by ODIHR.
