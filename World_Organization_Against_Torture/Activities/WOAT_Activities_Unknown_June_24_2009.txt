In the context of  the project OMCT works with national partners to prepare appeals in urgent cases and more  detailed complaints addressed to the United Nations, governments, development institutions,  the private sector and the institutions of the European Union. OMCT also organises seminars  and training courses to help build NGO capacity and invites NGO representatives to take part  in UN meetings. In the first two years of the implementation of this project, OMCT has learned that addressing  the economic, social and cultural root causes of violence through the appropriate channels has  a real potential to reduce human rights abuses, and that this in turn increases the space for  economic, social and cultural development. While the project aims to ensure respect for all  human rights, and in  particular economic, social and cultural rights in government economic,  development and other policies, it does not seek to determine what those policies should be.  OMCT has also found that demonstrating that violations of economic, social and cultural  rights can lead to torture and other serious forms of violence strengthens the pressure for  action not only on States, which do not want to see their economic and social policies  explicitly linked to violence, but also, for example, on the corporate sector, banks and  development agencies.  This bulletin contains an overview of the activities undertaken by this project in 2007 and  2008 in the following five areas of action: Working with NGOs to reinforce their capacity for action;Bringing about change through action files and other forms of interventions;Using the UN Treaty Bodies and other mechanisms to bring about change;Working with the European Union;Building a framework of understanding through advocacy.
