Brief reminder of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT received reports from the  Public Committee Against Torture in Israel (PCATI), a member of the OMCT network, that Bassam Na’im Ashak Natshe, I.D.  #982732596, a Hebron resident and father of four, was arrested on 30 December 1999.  According to the information received, Bassam Na’im Natshe was arrested and has been detained since in the GSS interrogation Unit of the Shikma Detention Center in Ashkelon.  On 2 January  2000, the counsel for Mr. Natshe attempted to meet with him but  was informed by the Shikma Detention Center that an Order  Prohibiting Meeting with Counsel had been imposed through to  January 6 2000.  Therefore, on January 3, PCATI, through its attorney Na’il Zahalka from the office of Attorney Andre Rosenthal, filed a  petition to the High Court of Justice demanding that the Order Prohibiting Meeting with Counsel be lifted and that Mr. Natshe be  informed that he has legal representation.  This petition was refused on 4 January.  GSS lawyer,  attorney Aner Helmann assured the court that he will inform Mr.  Natshe that he is represented and by whom.   On January 6, a military judge extended Mr. Natshe’s detention by 20 days and the Order prohibiting Meeting with Counsel was extended through 10  January.  However, the Order was in fact issued through 13 January.   On 12 January, PCATI filed a second petition to the High Court of Justice.  New Information  The International Secretariat of OMCT has received new information stating that on 13 January the High Court of Justice refused to accept PCATI's petition [case #310/2000] on the basis of national security and necessity of closed interrogation.  On 24 January attorney Na'il Zahalka met with Mr. Natshe, and learned that Mr. Natshe knew that he was represented and by whom. He also knew about the petitions filed in the High Court of Justice on his behalf. In this meeting, Mr. Natshe told attorney Na'il Zahalka that he was held in the G.S.S collaborators’ cell.  On the same day, 24 January, the Military Court in Erez extended his detention by 18 days.  On 27 January attorney Na'il Zahalka attempted to meet with his client, but was informed that an Order Prohibiting Meeting with Lawyer had been issued against Mr. Natshe. Attorney Na'il Zahalka did not receive any papers concerning the above order, or any information about its duration.  On the same day, he asked Attorney Aner Helmann from the General Attorney's office to inform him about the length of the order. Only on 30 January did he receive, by fax, a copy of the 27 January decision of Military Judge Sigal Mish'al to extended the Meeting Prohibition Order through 4 February 2000, midnight.  Therefore, on 30 January PCATI, through its attorney Andre Rosenthal, filed a third petition to the High Court of Justice demanding that the Order Prohibiting Meeting with Counsel be revoked.  Mr. Natshe is still being held at the Shikma detention center.  Action requested  Please write to the authorities in Israel urging them to:  i.	guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of  Bassam Na’im Ashak Natshe;  ii.	ensure his immediate release if he is being held in detention without any valid charges or, in the event  that there is, bring him immediately before a  competent and impartial tribunal and guarantee his full procedural rights as well as their right to legal counsel at all times, in conformity with the international human rights standards;  iii.	guarantee all human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards.
