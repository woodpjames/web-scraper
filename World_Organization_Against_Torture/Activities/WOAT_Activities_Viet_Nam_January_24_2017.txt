The Observatory for the Protection of Human
Rights Defenders, a partnership of FIDH and the World Organisation Against
Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in
Viet Nam.
 
Description of the situation:
 
The Observatory has been
informed by the Vietnam Committee on Human Rights (VCHR) about the arbitrary
arrest and detention of labour and land rights defender Ms. Tran Thi Nga.
 
According to the
information received, on January 21, 2017, the police arrested Ms. Tran Thi Nga
at her home in Phu Ly, Ha Nam Province, searched her house, and confiscated
several of her personal items. On the same day, Ms. Tran Thi Nga’s partner Mr. Luong Dan Ly, a pro-democracy activist
and blogger, was also arrested. He was released the following day.
 
Ms. Tran Thi Nga was
subsequently charged under Article 88 of the Criminal Code[1]
(“spreading propaganda against the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam”). On their
website, police said that Ms. Tran Thi Nga used the Internet “to spread some
propaganda videos and writings that are against the Government of the Social
Republic of Viet Nam”. If convicted, she could face up to 20 years in jail. 
 
Ms. Tran Thi Nga has been the target of frequent assaults by security
agents because of her human rights activities. In 2014, her leg was broken
during an altercation with the police. In the days prior to her arrest, Ms.
Tran Thi Nga complained of increasing police intimidation and harassment,
including surveillance of her home and being physically stopped from leaving
her house. Police also prevented a neighbour from taking the couple’s two young
sons to the city to buy them food.
 
The Observatory condemns
the arbitrary detention of Ms. Tran Thi Nga, as well as the charges against
her, which seem to be aimed at sanctioning her legitimate and peaceful human
rights activities. The Observatory calls on the Vietnamese authorities to
immediately and unconditionally release her and to drop all charges against
her.
 
Actions requested:

Please write to the authorities in Viet Nam urging them to:
 
i. Immediately and unconditionally release Ms. Tran Thi Nga as her detention is
arbitrary since it only seems to merely sanction her human rights activities;
 
ii.Guarantee in
all circumstances her physical and psychological integrity as well as that of
all human rights defenders in Viet Nam;
 
iii. Put an end to all acts harassment, including at
the judicial level, against Ms. Tran Thi Nga, as well as against all human rights defenders in Viet Nam;
 
iv. Amend
Article 88 of the Criminal Code, to bring it in conformity with international
human rights standards;
 
v. Comply with the provisions of the UN Declaration
on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the UN
General Assembly on December 9, 1998, in particular its Articles 1 and 12.2;
 
vi. More generally, ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and
fundamental freedoms in accordance with international and regional human rights
instruments ratified by Viet Nam.
