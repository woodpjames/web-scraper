According to the information received, on 15 November at around 2.30 p.m., a gunman introducing himself as Zeki Genç, member of the idealist centers linked to the National Movement Party (MHP), came into the IHD’s Istanbul branch office and threatened IHD staff with a gun and knife.  Ms. Eren Keskin, Chairperson of the Istanbul office; Gülseren Yoleri, executive secretary of IHD Istanbul branch; Doðan Genç and Þaban Dayanan, executive members of IHD Istanbul branch; and four other members, Ümit Efe, Güray Sazak, Ali Armutlu and Veysi Altay were all present at the office during the course of the attack. While trying to stop him, Saban Dayanan was injured and had his hand cut by Zeki Genç’s knife. According to the information, the aggressor was arrested by the police called by IHD staff.  It is to be noted that the day before this attack on IHD, on Wednesday 14 November, Zeki Genç had attacked two HADEP local branch offices in Istanbul and Sisli district premises and wounded two members by knife and gun, the former Tuzla district chairman, Cemal Kilikli, and the Sisli youth section’ chairman, Omer Kalayci. He was allegedly arrested by the police and released the same day.   It is further reported that following these incidents, hundreds of demonstrators, who gathered in front of IHD branch office in sign of protest were attacked by the police, that several people were wounded, and amongst them, HADEP (Democratic People’s Party) Istanbul branch office’s Chairman, M. Dogan Erbas and three HADEP members were arrested and put into police custody.  The Observatory would like to remind that the IHD is strongly involved in the defence of the Kurdish people rights and acts in favour of a pacific solution in the South eastern Turkey. Moreover, in recent days, it has been at the initiative of a strong mobilisation in reaction to the F-type prison crisis and has condemned the excessive and disproportionate use of force by the Turkish security forces and special police teams last November 6 in Kuçukarmatlu, in the Istanbul neighbourhood, where four death fasters, protesting against F type prison system were killed and other ten injured during a raid carried out by approximately one thousand members of the special police forces.   Your Excellency,   The Observatory wishes to request from you the adoption of the following recommendations:   i. guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of IHD members in Istanbul and ensure that they be allowed to carry out their work without obstacles in full respect of the European Union Copenhagen criteria enshrined in the euro-mediterranean partnership;  ii. carry out a full, impartial and effective investigation into these incidents in order to bring the responsible to trial and apply the penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions as provided by law;  iii. publicly condemn these attacks against human rights defenders;  iv. conform with the provisions of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders adopted on 9th December 1998 by the General Assembly of the United Nations, and in particular its article 12.2 which stipulates that “States shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure of any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his of her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration” and art. 12.3 which stipulates that “everyone is entitled, individually and in association with others, to be protected effectively under national law in reacting against or opposing, through peaceful means, activities and acts, including those by omission, attributable to States that result in violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as acts of violence perpetrated by groups or individuals that affect the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms”.   More generally, the Observatory requests that the Turkish authorities ensure the respect of fundamental human rights and freedoms in accordance with the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and international and regional human rights instruments ratified by Turkey.  Hoping that you will take these requests into consideration,   Sincerely yours,    	Sidiki KABA		                Eric SOTTAS	                                	      	President of the FIDH			Director of the OMCT
