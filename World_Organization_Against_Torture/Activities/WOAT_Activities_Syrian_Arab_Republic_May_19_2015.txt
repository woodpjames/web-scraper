Paris-Geneva, May 19, 2015 – Three 
prominent human rights defenders arbitrarily detained since February 2012 for 
promoting and protecting human rights in Syria were last seen on May 3, 2015. 
The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders (an FIDH-OMCT joint 
programme) is deeply concerned by their enforced disappearance and calls for 
their immediate and unconditional release.
 
Messrs. Mazen Darwish, Hani Al-Zaitani 
andHussain Ghrer, respectively President and members 
of the Syrian Centre for Media and Freedom of Expression (SCM), who are 
arbitrarily detained since February 2012, for promoting freedom of 
expression and monitoring gross human rights violations committed in the country 
have been unaccounted for since May 3, 2015.
 
On several occasions, visits to the Adra 
Prison, where Messrs. Mazen Darwish, Hani Al-Zaitani 
andHussain Ghrer had been transferred ahead of a 
verdict hearing scheduled on May 13, 2015, were unsuccessful. On May 10, 2015, 
prison authorities stated that the three defenders were not within the premises 
of the prison, as they had been summonsed for interrogation outside of the 
prison.
 
Furthermore, on May 13, 2015 the prison 
authorities failed to present the three detainees before court for a verdict 
hearing scheduled for that day. The trial, which has already been rescheduled 23 
times since February 2013, was therefore suspended until June 1, 2015.
 
“Syrian authorities should 
immediately disclose the fate and whereabouts ofMazen 
Darwish, Hani Al-Zaitani and Hussain 
Ghrer and put an end to the practice of enforced 
disappearance”, said FIDH President, Karim Lahidji.
 
On May 3, 2015, Mazen Darwish was awarded the 
UNESCO/Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize “in recognition of the work that 
he has carried out in Syria for more than ten years at great personal sacrifice, 
enduring a travel ban, harassment, as well as repeated detention and 
torture”.
 
During nine months in 2012, the three were held 
in conditions amounting to enforced disappearance and subjected to acts of 
torture. There has been no investigation into these abuses.
 
The Observatory recalls that the UN General 
Assembly, in its Resolution 67/262 adopted on May 15, 2013 called for the 
release of the three defenders. In January 2014, the UN Working Group on 
Arbitrary Detention (WGAD) also found that the three defenders had been 
arbitrarily deprived of their liberty due to their human rights activities and 
called for their immediate release. UN Security Council Resolution 2139, adopted 
on February 22, 2014, also demanded the release of all arbitrarily detained 
people in Syria.
 
“Syrian authorities should listen 
to UN calls and immediately and unconditionally release Messrs. Mazen Darwish, 
Hani Al-Zaitani and Hussain Ghrer as their detention is arbitrary and only aims 
at preventing them from carrying out their legitimate and peaceful human rights 
activities in Syria”, concluded OMCT Secretary General Gerald 
Staberock.
 
The Observatory for the Protection of Human 
Rights Defenders (OBS) was created in 1997 by FIDHand OMCT. The objective of this programme is 
to intervene to prevent or remedy to situations of repression against human 
rights defenders.
