Brief description of the situation: The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources that the website www.we-change.org was recently blocked by the authorities. According to the information received, this website is a campaign on-line that was launched by Iranian feminist groups on August 27, 2006, asking for the elimination of all forms of legal discrimination against women in Iranian law, and asking legislators to review and reform existing laws, so that they conform with the government’s commitments to international human rights conventions. Even if it remains accessible from abroad, the authorities blocked its access in Iran in January 2007. The Observatory expresses its deep concern about these events, along with the recurrent obstacles put on freedom of expression in Iran. Indeed, several dozens of international and national websites of NGOs and newspapers, calling for democratic reforms and the respect of fundamental freedoms, or denouncing human rights violations, have been blocked over the past few years. The Observatory considers that these facts contravene international human rights standards, in particular  the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), ratified by Iran, and the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on December 9, 1998, which article 6b states that “everyone is free (…) to publish, impart or disseminate to other views, information and knowledge on all human rights and fundamental freedoms”. Action requested: Please write to the Iranian authorities, urging them to:  Review the decision to block the website www.we-change.org, and ensure the full exercise of freedom of expression in the country;  Guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of all human rights defenders in Iran, and put an end to all forms of harassment against them; Conform with the above Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, in particular its article 1 which provides that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, above-mentioned article 6(b) and article 12.2, which states that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”; More generally, ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in Iran in accordance with international human rights standards.
