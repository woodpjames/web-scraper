Description of the situation: The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the refusal of the Chinese authorities to renew the license of Mr. Li Jianqiang’s, a lawyer committed in the defence of dissidents in the PRC. According to the information received, the Shandong Provincial Bureau of Judicial Affairs rejected Mr. Li Jianqiang’s application for renewing his license in June 2007, the month for the annual renewal of lawyers’ licenses in China. The Shandong authorities did not provide any explanation, oral or written, for this decision. According to Mr. Li, this lack of written decision makes it difficult for him to appeal. The Observatory expresses its concern regarding this decision, which seems to merely sanction Mr. Li’s activities in favour of dissident voices in China. Mr. Li has indeed represented several writers, journalists, and organisers of opposition parties in court in recent years, including the writer Yang Tianshui, poet Li Hong, activist and artist Yan Zhengxue (See Observatory Annual Report 2006), and dissident Chi Jianwei. The Observatory further expresses its concern over the determination of the Chinese authorities to obstruct the work of human rights defenders. The Observatory wishes to recall that according to Article 11 of the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 9, 1998, “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to the lawful exercise of his or her occupation or profession”. The Observatory wishes to recall that the National People’s Congress amended the Chinese Constitution in 2004 to include that “the State respects and safeguards human rights” and that in April 2006, the PRC submitted a document in order to support its candidacy to the Human Rights Council’s first election[1], in which it affirmed that the amendment to the Constitution was aiming at “defining the position of human rights in the overall national development strategy. The Observatory further wishes to point out that as a member of the Human Rights Council, the PRC “shall uphold the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights”[2]. Actions required: Please write to the Chinese authorities urging them to:  Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Li Jianqiang; Ensure that the decision of the Shandong Provincial Bureau of Judicial Affairs to reject Mr. Li Jianqiang’s application be revised or at least a formal communication be given so that he can appeal this decision; Guarantee that adequate reparation is provided to Mr. Li Jianqiang, as a victim of this abuse; Put an end to any kind of act of harassment and threats against all human rights defenders in the country; Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, its above-mentioned Article 11 and its Article 12.2, which states that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”; Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by the People’s Republic of China.
