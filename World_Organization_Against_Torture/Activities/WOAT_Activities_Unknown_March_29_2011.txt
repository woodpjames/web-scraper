The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of
the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation
Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent intervention in the following
situation in Iran. 
Description of the situation:
The Observatory has been informed by reliable
sources of continuing acts of harassment against
human rights defenders in Iran.
On March
16, 2011, the lawyer of Mr. Kaveh Ghassemi Kermanshahi, Iranian
journalist member of the Central Council of the Human Rights Organisation of
Kurdistan, also signatory of the “One Million Signatures Campaign” and a member
of the student alumni group ADVAR, was notified that his client had been
sentenced in appeal to four years in prison by the Revolutionary Court in
Kermanshah for allegedly “acting against national security” and “propaganda
against the regime” by giving interviews to the media and publishing news and
reports about families of political prisoners and victims. The latter has been
harassed over the past years[1],
and had been sentenced on January 30, 2011 to five years imprisonment in first
instance[2].
In
addition, on March 17, 2011, Mr. Abdolreza Tajik, journalist and human
rights activist, was sentenced by Branch 26 of the Revolutionary Court to a
total of six years in prison, i.e. five years for “membership in an illegal
group”[3]; and one year for
“propaganda against the regime”. Furthermore, Mr. Tajik remains accused of
“publishing false reports in order to disrupt public opinion”, and the court
has not yet issued a sentence for that charge. He remains free on bail, and
intends to appeal this sentencing.
The
Observatory condemns these sentences against Mr. Kaveh Ghassemi Kermanshahi and Mr. Abdolreza Tajik which clearly aims at sanctioning
their human rights activities. The Observatory therefore urges the Iranian
authorities to drop all proceedings against them as well as the
additional charges brought against Mr. Tajik.
Actions requested:
Please write to the Iranian authorities and ask them
to:
i.             
Guarantee
in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Kaveh
Ghassemi Kermanshahi and Mr. Abdolreza Tajik as well as all human rights defenders in Iran;
ii.            
Put an
end to acts of harassment - including at the judicial level - against them as
well as against all human rights defenders in Iran;
iii.           
Conform
in any circumstances with the provisions of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders,
adopted on December 9, 1998 by the United Nations General Assembly, in
particular its:
-         
Article
1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually or in association
with others, to promote the protection and realization of human rights and
fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”;
-         
Article 5
(b) which provides that “for the purpose of
promoting and protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms, everyone has
the right, individually and in association with others, at the national and
international levels to form, join and participate in non-governmental
organizations, associations or groups”;
-         
 Article 6  (b) and (c) which states that
“Everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, as
provided for in human rights and other applicable international instruments,
freely to publish, impart or disseminate to others views, information and
knowledge on all human rights and fundamental freedoms;  to study,
discuss, form and hold opinions on the observance, both in law and in practice,
of all human rights and fundamental freedoms and, through these and other
appropriate means, to draw public attention to those matters”,
-         
and
Article 12.2 which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures
to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually
and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de
facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action
as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in
the present Declaration”;
iv. Ensure in all circumstances respect
for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international
human rights standards and international instruments ratified by Iran.
