The Observatory for the
Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the International
Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation Against Torture
(OMCT), has received new information and requests your urgent intervention in
the following situation in Kyrgyzstan.
 
New information:
 
The Observatory was informed by reliable sources of the decision of the
Bishkek City Court to postpone the appeal hearing related to a court decision
of the Pervomaysky District Court of Bishkek that banned the screening of the
human rights documentary “I am Gay and Muslim”, initially scheduled on
September 28, 2012 at the festival Bir Duyno - Kyrgyzstan (One World -
Kyrgyzstan). 
 
The Human Rights Centre (HRC) “Citizen Against Corruption” (CAC) indeed
filed a complaint before the Bishkek City Court in order to overturn the court
decision of the Pervomaysky District Court banning the screening of the
documentary (See background information).
 
According to the information received, on December 5, 2012, the appeal
hearing, which was scheduled to be addressed, was delayed to December 26, 2012.
 
The Observatory reiterates its call on the Kyrgyz authorities to ensure
that fair trial standards and the equal access to justice are fully respected
at the hearing of December, 26, 2012, in accordance with the article 14 of the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which
Kyrgyzstan is a State party.
 
Background information:
 
On September 28, 2012, the Pervomaysky District Court of Bishkek
reportedly banned the film “I am Gay and Muslim” on the whole Kyrgyz
territory, thus preventing its broadcast in any circumstances. This order
followed a complaint lodged by the Prosecutor's Office of the Republic of
Kyrgyzstan, which requested that the film be recognised as “extremist, inciting
religious hatred and aimed at dishonouring Muslims”. As the decision of the
court came into force immediately, the festival's organisers could not contest
the ruling before the scheduled screening time. The HRC CAC subsequently filed
an appeal to overturn the Pervomaysky court's decision, which the Bishkek City
Court was scheduled to address to hear on December 5, 2012. The hearing was
later delayed to December 26, 2012.
 
In addition, in that context Mrs. Tolekan Ismailova, Director of
the HRC CAC and Director of the human rights film festival Bir Duyno, has been
targeted by a smear campaign depicting her as spreading propaganda for
homosexuality and destructing Kyrgyz values in relation with the film “I am Gay and Muslim”. Such accusations
were spread on a TV programme broadcast on October 14, 2012, as well as in a
Kyrgyz newspaper.
 
It is also to be mentioned that on September 27, 2012, the festival
organisers, including Mrs. Tolekan Ismailova and other members of HRC CAC, had
received phone calls and text messages threatening them with physical assault.
The director of the cinema “Manas”, where the film was to be shown, also
received threats that the building would be burnt down if the screening was not
cancelled.
 
Finally,
on October 8, 2012, HRC CAC received a letter from their web hosting company
warning the human rights NGO that its website might be shut down if it
contained references or links to the said documentary.
 
On the day the film “I am Gay and Muslim” was banned upon a
decision of the Pervomaysky District Court, around 11 am, four representatives
of the State Committee of National Security (SCNS) presented themselves at the
HRC CAC offices. One of them, Mr. N. Soodanbekov, served a warning to Mrs.
Tolekan Ismailova, alleging that the documentary “I am Gay and Muslim”, scheduled on the same day on the occasion of
the human rights film festival Bir Duyno – Kyrgyzstan (One World – Kyrgyzstan)[1],
was considered as encouraging “inter-religious hatred”. The warning read as
follows: “according to the decision by the State Commission of Religious
Affairs, based on point 6.1 of Article 1 of the 'Law on Combating Extremist
Activity', the film is considered 'extremist' and its diffusion and
broadcasting within the territory of the Republic of Kyrgyzstan might encourage
religious hatred and set the scene for mass disorder”.
 
As the SCNC official who served this warning did not have the authority
to do so, and as the official procedure was not followed, Mrs. Ismailova
subsequently lodged a complaint. On October 31, 2012, the first hearing was
held before the Bishkek Inter-district Court, allowing Mrs. Ismailova and HRC
CAC's lawyer to give all the details of the legal violations mentioned above.
On November 27, 2012, the Court rejected Mrs. Ismailova's complaint. The human
rights defender intends to appeal this decision.
