Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Humanitarian Law Center of the physical assault on 23-year old Mr. Mirko Vuletiæ on July 11th, 2003, by four officers of the Police Department in Cetinje, Montenegro. The Humanitarian Law Center (HLC) has filed a criminal complaint concerning these beatings.   According to the information received, Inspectors Nenadovic, Asanovic and Živanovic, and Officer Prelevic beat up Mirko Vuletic because he was one of a group that tried to break up a verbal conflict between the three police inspectors and two brothers named Djurickovic that was threatening to escalate into a fistfight.   On the day in question, Mirko Vuletic was at the Bildon Cafe in Cetinje where his brother worked. Hearing a noise outside, he went to see what was going on and saw the three inspectors quarrelling with the Djurickovic brothers. After an exchange of insults, the brothers left the scene, followed later by the inspectors.  A short while later, Mirko Vuletic was getting into his car when a police patrol and the three inspectors arrived. Inspector Nenadovic then pulled Mirko Vuletic out of the car and another policeman and inspector caught hold of him. Mirko Vuletic broke away and started running, hearing the police shout "throw a nightstick at him" and "shoot at him." Mirko Vuletic ran into a building and closed the door behind him. The police started banging on the door and soon broke it open. Inspector Živanovic rushed in and started punching and kicking Mirko Vuletic and was soon joined by the others, who also used their nightsticks. The police then dragged Mirko Vuletic to the patrol car. On the way to the police station, one of them punched him repeatedly in the stomach. The beating continued on the stairway in the police station and in an office. Inspector Nenadovic allegedly gave Mirko Vuletic several heavy blows to the chest and Inspector Asanovic struck him about the head and jaw. Mirko Vuletic reportedly fell to the floor and they continued to kick him all over the body and in the head.   The physical abuse reportedly ceased when Police Chief Ulama entered the office and ordered them to stop. When Mirko Vuletic started vomiting and bleeding from the head, the head of Criminal Investigations Minja Šoc ordered the inspectors to take him to the hospital. Doctors there asked what had happened to Mirko Vuletic and Inspector Nenadovic allegedly replied, "he got into a fight with some guys and they beat him up." Following his release from hospital, Mirko Vuletic was sent home.  The medical certificate issued by the hospital states that Mirko Vuletic suffered physical injuries inflicted with "blunt instrument" (police baton) and "blunt force" (feet and fists).   The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned by the allegations of beatings perpetrated against Mr. Mirko Vuletic by the afore-mentioned members of the Cetinje Police Department in Montenegro. OMCT calls on the authorities to immediately launch a prompt and impartial investigation into these events, notably the allegations of violent physical abuse, in order to identify those responsible, bring them before a competent and impartial tribunal and apply the penal and/or administrative sanctions provided by law. OMCT also calls on the authorities to ensure that he is granted adequate reparation for the injuries that he sustained, including appropriate medical assistance.
