The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of
the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and the International Federation
for Human Rights (FIDH), requests your urgent intervention
in the following situation in The
Philippines.
 
Brief
description of the situation:
 
The
Observatory has been informed by Task Force Detainees of the Philippines (TFDP)
of the intimidation of, and threats against, Ms. Carolyn R. Borja and Ms. Nenita
Lacasa, respectively President of Carapdapan Movement for Development
Association (CAMADA INC.), and staff member.
 
According to
the information received, on June
 19, 2012, Ms Lacasa was at home at 2pm on May 6, 2012,
when Mr. Teros Lopido, Trustee of the President of the Terrestrial Mining
Corporation, got off a pick up and aimed one shot at the upper storey before
leaving the scene. Ms. Lacasa also reported that unknown individuals had been
monitoring her home on several occasions in May, at times standing guard in a
pick up with the same number plate. In addition, on May 23, 2012,
individuals riding two motorcycles fired shots at 11 pm on Ms.
Borja’s home before fleeing the scene.
 
These
violent acts of intimidation come in the wake of the stabbing to death, on May 1, 2012,
of Mr. Franciso P. Canayong,
President of Integrated Upland Farmers Association of Salcedo (BIUFAS), and
member of Carapdapan Land Owners Association (CLOA), an organisation registered
with the department of Labor and Employment (DOLE). Mr. Canayong was also a
member of CAMADA INC., and of Samar
island partnership for peace and development. Mr. Canayong, a community leader, had
led the people’s organization in actively supporting and advocating for peace
and development issues, and particularly for the protection of the environment.
He was active in the local campaign against the mining operation in Salcedo and
in other parts of Eastern Samar, in the Eastern Visayas archipelago.
 
A few weeks before his killing, on March 19, 2012, Mr. Canayong, along with Ms Borja
and Mr. Antonio M. Norte, barangay[1] councilor, had filed an
affidavit in relation to verbal threats they had overheard on March 17,2012, during a conversation between Mr.
Lopido, and some of his colleagues. The affidavit stated that Mr. Lopido had
mentioned the names of Mr. Canayong, Mr. Norte and Ms. Borja, and the names of
their associations. According to the affidavit, Mr. Lopido had threatened that
“if the mining operation [is] stopped, they must leave their home and never
show up again” otherwise he would kill them. According to the affidavit, Mr.
Lopido had said that he would “enter each of their houses and kill them” if Mr.
Canayong and his companions “interfered with their incoming chromite ore
shipment.”
 
Mr. Canayong had consistently
opposed mining activities because of its detrimental health and environmental
impact on the community. On March 14 and 15, 2011, he had joined a barricade in
barangay Carapdapan to stop the illegal transport of chromite ore by
Terrestrial Mining Corporation on its way to China. Due to the group’s
actions, the mining company had filed a civil case for damages against Mr.
Canayong, Ms. Borja and 3 other members of their group at the Regional trial
Court (RTC) branch 139 in Makati City, Manila.
 
In September 2011, Mr. Canayong,
along with Ms. Borja and members of their group, had filed complaints with the
office of the Ombudsman for the failure of the local government to intervene
and stop the illegal mining activities in the area.
