New Information  The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned by the charges of illegal assembly and police harassment brought against Lokman Adam.  OMCT has been informed that on 5 August 2000, Lokman Adam, youth leader of the National Justice Party (KeADILan) was released on police bail and then immediately re-arrested by the police, in connection with a protest held in a National Mosque in March 2000.  The gathering at the National Mosque had protested against the restrictions on and harassment of a popular newspaper 'Harakah' which publishes pro-reform articles and news on Anwar Ibrahim.  On 7 August 2000 he was brought before a magistrates court and remanded for another 3 days for a police investigation.  On 8 August 2000, Lokman was brought before the magistrates court a second time and charged for illegal assembly and harassing the police during the pro-'Harakah' gathering in March 2000.  Brief reminder of the situation  According to information received from Aliran, a member of the OMCT network, 7 persons were arrested, including Lokman Adam, by police and one man severely beaten during a demonstration today, 4th August 2000, outside the magistrate court.  The demonstration was to show support for the former deputy prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, whose verdict on his sodomy trial was supposed to handed down this morning, (although it had been postponed by the judge yesterday), and to show support and follow the trial of about 30 others who had previously been charged for illegal assembly.  Action requested  Please write to the authorities in Malaysia urging them to:  i.	take all necessary measures to guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of Lokman Adam and ensure that his procedural rights are guaranteed at all times; ii.	guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
