Brief description of the situation The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Jordan Society for Human Rights (JSHR), a member of the OMCT network, of the arrest and incommunicado detention of Mr Abdul-Hamid Yassin by the Intelligence Service Department. According to information received, Mr Abdul-Hamid Yassin was arrested on 31 May 2004 in his home in Sweileh by the Intelligence Service Department. It is reported that since his arrest he has been detained incommunicado at the Intelligence Service Prison in Amman. The reason for his arrest is still unknown.

Furthermore, OMCT calls on the authorities to launch prompt, thorough and impartial investigations into the circumstances of this event in order to find those responsible for any violations of human rights and to bring them to justice.   Action requested: Please write to the authorities in Jordan urging them to:  i. take all measures necessary to guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of Mr Abdul-Hamid Yassin;  ii. order his immediate release in the absence of legal charges that are consistent with international law and standards, or, if such charges exist, bring him before an impartial and competent tribunal and guarantee his procedural rights at all times;  iii. order a thorough and impartial investigation into the circumstances of this event in order to identify those responsible, bring them to trial and apply the penal and/or administrative sanctions as provided by law;  iv. guarantee the respect for human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
