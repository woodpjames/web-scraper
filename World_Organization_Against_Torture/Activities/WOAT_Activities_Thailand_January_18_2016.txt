Their “advocacy trip”, named “the Train Ride to Shed Light on Fraud at the Rajabhakti Park”, sought to demand the opening of an investigation into alleged corruption in the construction of the military-sponsored Rajabhakti Park in Prachuab Kirikhan Province. On their way to Hua Hin, the activists were stopped at Baan Pong train station, Ratchaburi province, where 36 of them were arrested. They were subsequently taken in military custody to the 9th Infantry Regiment Command, a temporary military unit in Putthamonthon Buddhist Park, Nakhon Pathom. The military officers claimed to have arrested and detained them in accordance with NCPO Order No. 3/2015, which imposes a ban on political gatherings of five or more persons without a prior official authorization[1]. While in custody, some officers recorded their personal data and forced them to sign a pledge vowing they would not join any political movement again in the future and that they would not leave the country without the authorities’ prior permission. Lawyers were denied access to the detainees throughout their detention. All were released on the same day. However, 11 activists refused to sign the pledge, and were therefore accused of violating NCPO Order No. 3/2015. On December 29, 2015, the 11 activists who had refused to sign the pledge were summoned by the Thonburi Railway police. The Thai Lawyers for Human Rights (TLHR)[2], an organization that provides legal representation to the activists, submitted a letter on behalf of nine of them to postpone the summons to January 8, 2016, on the grounds that the latter would not be able to show up on that date due to other ongoing judicial proceedings against them amongst others[3]. Accordingly, the Thonburi Railway police allowed the adjournment as requested. On December 29, only two of the 11 summoned activists appeared. Messrs. Kititituch Suman and Vichit Hanhaboon denied all charges. Mr. Vichit Hanhaboon was asked to submit an additional written defense statement to the police regarding the circumstances of the events within January 15, 2016. On January 8, 2016, three more activists, Mr. Anon Nampa, Mr. Wisarut Anukulkanm, and Ms. Kornkanok Khumta, appeared at the police station and similarly denied all charges. On January 13, 2016, arrest warrants were issued by the Bangkok Military Court for the six remaining activists who had failed to appear at the police station on January 8 as summoned. If indicted by military prosecutor, the 11 activists will face trial before a military court, and could face up to six months of imprisonment and/or a fine not exceeding 10,000 Baht (approximately 250 Euros), for violations of NCPO Order No. 3/2015. The Observatory strongly condemns the ongoing judicial harassment against the 11 activists, since it appears to only aim at sanctioning their legitimate human rights activities, as well as their freedom of assembly, association and expression, as enshrined in international human rights instruments. Accordingly, the Observatory calls on the Thai authorities to put an end to the ongoing attempts to criminalise the 11 activists, as well as to put its legislation on gatherings in line with international human rights standards ratified by Thailand. Actions requested: Please write to the authorities in Thailand, urging them to:       i.         Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of the 11 activists, as well as of all human rights defenders in the country;      ii.         Drop immediately and unconditionally all charges against the 11 activists, as they only seem to be aimed at sanctioning his legitimate human rights activities;      iii.         Put an end to all acts of harassment - including at the judicial level - against the 11 activists, as well as against all human rights defenders in Thailand so that they are able to carry out their work without hindrances;      iv.         Repeal NCPO Order No. 3/2015, which contravenes Thailand’s human rights obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR);      v.         Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially: - Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”; and - Article 12.2, which provides that “"the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”; and     vi.         More generally, ensure in all circumstances the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with international and regional human rights instruments ratified by Thailand. Addresses:Prime Minister, Gen Prayuth Chan-ocha, Government House, 1 Phitsanulok Road, Dusit, 10300, Bangkok, THAILAND;

Although in existence for just more than a year, TLHR received a human rights award by the French Embassy in Bangkok in December 2014.[3]    For example, Mr. Thanet Anantawong, who was charged with sedition for his Facebook post criticising the NCPO, could not report himself to police as he had to appear before the Bangkok Military Court for pre-trial detention and bail the same day.
