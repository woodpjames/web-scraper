New information: The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources, including the Iranian League for the Defence of Human Rights (LDDHI), of the new arbitrary arrest of Ms. Nahid Keshavarz and Ms. Mahboubeh Hosseinzadeh, two members of the media committee of the “One Million Signatures Campaign”[1]. According to the information received, on April 2, 2007, Ms. Nahid Keshavarz and Ms. Mahboubeh Hosseinzadeh were arrested at the Laleh park, in Tehran, while collecting signatures in support of a petition to change discriminatory laws against women. Three other members of the Campaign, Ms. Sara Imanian, Mr. Homayoun Nami and Ms. Saiedeh Amin, were released after spending a day in detention at the police station. On April 3, 2007, Ms. Nahid Keshavarz and Ms. Mahboubeh Hosseinzadeh were taken to the Revolutionary Court.  During their interrogations, they were asked to sign a statement agreeing to end their activities in the “Campaign”.  When they refused to do so, the two women were charged with “actions against national security” and transferred to the Evin Prison. They are currently detained in the 209 section. In particular, they were told that the demands of the “Campaign” with respect to equal rights to inheritance for women, equal value of testimony of men and women, equal financial remuneration for bodily injury or death, and the elimination of polygamy were in contradiction with the tenants of Islam.

She served as a journalist for the website of this leading NGO engaged in capacity building for civil society. She has also been a journalist with reformist dailies for seven years.
