Brief description of the situationThe International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by a reliable source of the disappearance of Mr. Alisher Usmanov, following his release from the prison (CIZO) located in Kazan, Republic of Tatarstan, Russian Federation, on June 29, 2005. OMCT fears that he has been extrajudicially extradited to Uzbekistan where his physical and psychological integrity may be in danger.   Mr. Alisher Usmanov, who works as a teacher in the “The thousand-year old Islam” religious school (madrasa) located in Kazan, was arrested on September 29, 2004. He was allegedly accused of organising the regional network of an Islamic party, “Hizb ut-Tahrir”, that is forbidden in Russia, of having sent combatants into Chechnya, as well as being accused of the illegal possession of ammunition. According to the information received, the first two accusations were not proven during the trial. On June 2, 2005, Mr. Alisher Usmanov was sentenced to a 9 month jail sentence for illegal possession of ammunition. Mr. Alisher Usmanov claimed that this ammunition was planted by the secret services during the search of his house.  According to the information received, Mr. Alisher Usmanov’s detention was supposed to end on June 29, 2005. However, Mr. Alisher Usmanov’s wife stated that her husband was not released from prison on this date. The authorities reportedly stated that Mr. Alisher Usmanov had been released on June 29, 2005, at 5 a.m. Since that date, Mr. Alisher Usmanov’s wife has not heard from her husband. Mr. Alisher Usmanov’s family lodged a missing person complaint at the regional office for interior affairs (ROVD) of Vahitovskij (city of Kazan). According to the information received, Mr. Alisher Usmanov, who holds a Russian passport, risks an extrajudicial extradition to Uzbekistan. Such a measure was reportedly taken against an Uzbek citizen living in the Russian Federation in May, 2005.   The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned by the disappearance of Mr. Alisher Usmanov and fears for his physical and psychological integrity. Actions requested: Please write Russian authorities urging them to: i.	Order an independent and immediate investigation into the whereabouts of Mr. Alisher Usmanov, and communicate his whereabouts to his family;  ii.	If Mr. Alisher Usmanov is still detained, ensure his immediate release;  iii.	If Mr. Alisher Usmanov was improperly extradited to Uzbekistan, ensure his immediate return to The Russian Federation.
