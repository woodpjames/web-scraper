New information  According to information received, the hearing of the appeal of Amina Lawal, who was convicted of adultery and sentenced to death by stoning, began in Northern Nigeria. The four judges of the Sharia Court have, after hearing from her defense counsel on 8 July 2002, adjourned the case until next month.    Brief reminder of the Situation  The International Secretariat of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) is deeply concerned by the sentencing to death by stoning of 30 year-old Amina Lawal.  According to information received from reliable sources, on Friday 22 March 2002, a Sharia court at Bakori in Katsina State sentenced Ms. Lawal to death after she confessed to having had a child while divorced. The man named as the father of her baby girl reportedly denied having sex with her and the charges against him were discontinued. In those Northern Nigerian states that apply Sharia law, pregnancy outside of marriage constitutes sufficient evidence to enable a woman to be convicted of adultery. Under the applicable procedural rules, Amina Lawal had 30 days in which to appeal her sentence.  On 3 June 2002 the Sharia court at Funtua in Katsina State, Northern Nigeria ordered the conditional  release of Amina Lawal until January 2003, to allow her to return to her village in order to care for her 6 month old daughter.   The court had stated that the decision in relation to her conditional release is independent of the decision in her appellate hearing which is expected to be handed down on 8 July.  Action requested  Please write to the Nigerian authorities urging them to:  i.        guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of Ms. Amina Lawal and her family; ii.       ensure Ms. Amina Lawal the right to a fair trial and allow her effective access to legal        representation. iii.	take all necessary measures to secure respect for the rule of law in Nigeria which includes             respect for the prohibition on torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment and              punishment, such as the practice of corporal punishment;  iv.	guarantee women their human rights, including their right to be free from discrimination and their right to be free from torture and inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment; v.	ensure in all circumstances the full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with national and international standards.
