Release / Judicial harassment

The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights
Defenders, a joint programme of the International Federation for Human Rights
(FIDH) and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), has received new
information and requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in
Turkey.
 
New information:
 
The Observatory has been informed by the Human Rights Association
(İHD) about the release of Ms. Roza Erdede,
İHD member in Diyarbakır.
 
According to the
information received, on June 1, 2012, Ms. Roza Erdede was
released on bail pending the outcome of the trial on terrorism charges. The
trial shall resume on June 29, 2012.
 
While the Observatory
welcomes this positive development, it notes that she continues to be subjected
to judicial harassment. Moreover,, the Observatory recalls that two other İHD
members are still in pre-trial detention in the same case: Mr. Muharrem
Erbey, İHD General Vice Chairperson and Chairperson of its Diyarbakir
Province branch, and Mr. Arslan Özdemir, İHD member in Diyarbakır. 
 
Accordingly, the
Observatory calls upon the Turkish authorities to put an end to the continuing
judicial harassment of human rights associations and defenders, and urges the
Turkish authorities to immediately and unconditionally release Messrs.
Muharrem Erbey and Arslan Özdemir since their detention is arbitrary as its only purpose
seems to be the silencing of their human rights activities.
 
Background
information: 
 
Ms. Roza Erdede, Mr. Muharrem Erbey and Mr. Arslan Özdemir, were arrested respectively on April 14, 2010 and on December 23, 2009,
by the Anti-Terror Units as part of an operation launched in 11 Turkish
provinces to dismantle a so-called “terrorist network” - the Kurdish
Communities Union (KCK) - an organisation considered by the Turkish authorities
to be the “urban branch” of the armed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). They are
among 152 Kurdish civil society figures under trial in this case.
 
On June 18,
2010, the three were formally indicted for “being member[s] of an illegal
organisation” pursuant to Article 314 of the Criminal Code, with reference to
Article 220/6 of the Criminal Code in the Law No. 5237, punishable by 7,5 to
15-year prison sentence. From the record of Mr. Erbey’s interrogation it
appeared however that he had been imprisoned and indicted on the basis of his
work with the İHD, and in his capacity as human rights lawyer. The trial opened
before the Sixth Special Heavy Penal Court of Diyarbakır on October 18, 2010. 
 
The investigation and trial have raised a
series of fair trial concerns, including: illegal surveillance and tapping,
prolonged pre-trial detention and limited access, by the defendants and their
lawyers, to the evidence against them. The trial has been delayed in part
because the court has consistently denied many of the defendants their rights
to address the court in Kurdish, their mother-tongue, and because the court
refused to examine the defendants’ conditions of detention. 
 
Actions requested:
 
i. Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity
of Ms. Roza Erdede and Messrs. Muharrem Erbey and Arslan Özdemir,as well as all
other members of İHD, and in general, of all human rights defenders in Turkey;
 
ii. Release immediately and unconditionally Messrs. Muharrem Erbey and
Arslan Özdemir since their detention is arbitrary as it only aims at
sanctioning their human rights activities;
 
iii. Put an end to all acts harassment, including at the judicial level,
against Messrs. Muharrem Erbey and Arslan Özdemir and Ms. Roza Erdede as well
as against all other members of İHD, and, in general, against all human rights defenders in Turkey;
 
iv. Comply with the provisions of the United Nations Declaration on Human
Rights Defenders, especially its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the
right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive
for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at
the national and international levels”, as well as Article 12.2, which provides
that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by
the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others,
against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse
discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his
or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present
Declaration”;
 
v. More generally, ensure in all circumstances the respect for human
rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international and regional
human rights instruments ratified by Turkey.
