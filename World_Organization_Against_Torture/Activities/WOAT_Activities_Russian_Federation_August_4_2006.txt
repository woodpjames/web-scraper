Brief description of the situationThe International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Society for the Russian-Chechen Friendship, a member of the OMCT network, of the forced disappearance of Mr. Jautkhanov Ali Khamzatovich (born in 1977) on 27 July 2006 by representatives of an unidentified force agency.    According to the information received, at 8.00 pm five armed men entered the house of Mr. Jautkhanov Ali Khamzatovich and took him into the garden where they allegedly tried to put a small package in his pocket, containing an unknown substance (supposedly narcotic). His wife responded by taking the package away from her husband after which she spread the content all around. Following this, she was kicked in the face and stomach and threatened to be killed by the alleged chief of the group. Mr. Jautkhanov Ali Khamzatovich was then forced into one of the two cars, a VAZ-21099 and a VAZ-2107, of the force agency after which his whereabouts remain unknown.   According to the information received, the whole incident was witnessed by their neighbours and by several people in the street, among whom was Mr. Uguzaev Dukvakha Mokhievich (born in 1977). As he tried to come to the defence of Mr. Jautkhanov Ali Khamzatovich and his wife, he was seized by the same group of men. It is alleged that he was beaten and threatened before he was released after an hour.   It is reported that Mr. Jautkhanov Ali Khamzatovich’s relatives submitted an appeal to the Samashki village police office. However, the service personnel claimed that they were unaware of Mr. Jautkhanov Ali Khamzatovich’s whereabouts and that he had not been brought to their premises. Furthermore, they stated that they did not know anything about the detention of Mr. Jautkhanov Ali Khamzatovich by any force agency and therefore his relatives were advised to make an inquiry at Achkhoy-Martan district police office.  The International Secretariat of OMCT expresses its concern over the psychical and psychological integrity of Mr. Jautkhanov Ali Khamzatovich.
