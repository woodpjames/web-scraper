Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by a number of organisations, including ALIRAN, a member of the OMCT network, of the arrest of 5 members of the Parti KeAdilan Nasional (National Justice Party) and, as confirmed by the police, 46 Malaysians, including 2 women and a minor, in connection with a peaceful gathering marking the first anniversary of Anwar’s conviction and imprisonment on 14th April 2000.    According to the information, the leaders of KeAdilan are to be brought before the court this Friday, 21st April 2000 and the 46 detainees on Saturday, 22nd April 2000.  According to reports, Roslan Kassim (Parti KeAdilan Nasional) was arrested at around 3am, on Friday 14th April 2000 in his home by about 14 policemen.  He was brought before the Magistrate court in Jalan Raja, Kuala Lumpur.  The court gave a seven day remand order.  He is suspected under Section 27(3) Police Act for allegedly inciting the public to participate in an illegal assembly.    Another politician, Youth chief Mohd Ezam was also was arrested on the same day at Sungai Petani, Kedah after his Friday prayer around 2:20pm.  Gopalakrishnan, Keadilan Youth Central Committee, was also arrested at around 11:30 am at Rantau Panjang Kelantan.  According to the information, these two men have not been seen since their arrest, nor brought before a court, which is in violation of the Federal Constitution.  Previously, in relation to these arrests, the police had refused to grant a permit for Parti KeAdilan Nasional to hold a peaceful gathering on Saturday, April 15th 2000 in Kuala Lumpur.  However, on 15th April 2000 a peaceful gathering was held at the National Mosque to present a memorandum to the King.  This was responded to with heavy-action by the police who arrested supporters and used tear gas and water cannons, even in the vicinity of the National Mosque, in order to disperse the gathering.  It was reported that at least 46 persons, including 2 women and a minor, had been detained.  The International Secretariat of OMCT has not received the names of these persons arrested.  Furthermore, on 16th April 2000, it was reported that Mr. Tian Chua, 36, Vice-President of the National Justice Party and Cheah Kah Peng, 34, lawyer and Vice-President of the National Justice Party, Penang branch, were also arrested following a press conference with other leaders from the National Justice Party and Democratic Action Party.
