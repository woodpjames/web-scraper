Item 6- UPR Outcomes: Brazil
Oral Statement to be delivered by the World Organization Against Torture
(OMCT)
Thank you Mr.
President,
The World
Organization Against Torture (OMCT) welcomes the report of the Working Group on
the UPR of Brazil and would like to thank all Member States that have relayed
the concerns expressed by civil society organizations.
We welcome
particularly the recommendation to reject the proposed Constitutional amendment
and draft bills that seek to reduce the age of criminal responsibility,
especially considering that the Brazilian Senate is scheduled to vote on this
issue next week. 
We are also concerned
about bills aiming at increasing the time of detention for children and
encourage the Brazilian Government to reject them, in line with its
international obligations.
We welcome
recommendations to prevent and combat torture and ill-treatment, and to conduct
timely and impartial investigations into all allegations of unlawful killings,
abuse and torture involving security forces and prison personnel, especially
for crimes committed against children deprived of liberty. 
We encourage Brazil
to ensure that Local Preventive Mechanisms for the Prevention and combat of
torture are created and that the National Mechanism is effectively implemented.

Finally, we
encourage the Government of Brazil to ratify the third optional protocol to the
Convention on the Rights of the Child on a communications procedure ensuring
that children are able to petition internationally for their rights. 
Thank
