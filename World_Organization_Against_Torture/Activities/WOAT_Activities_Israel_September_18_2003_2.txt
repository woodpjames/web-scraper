Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel, a member of the OMCT network, of the incommunicado detention of two men in Israel.  According to the information received, Mr. Yitzhak Paz of Hebron and Mr. Mattityahu Shvo of Maon were arrested July 17th, 2003 on suspicion of security offences. The following day, Mr. Paz's detention was extended for 6 additional days and Mr. Shvo's detention was extended for an additional 8 days. Also, an order was issued prohibiting the detainees from meeting with their lawyer until July 22nd, 2003. Moreover, the court issued a gag order on any further details regarding this case.   The two men are reportedly being held under very difficult conditions. They are being prevented from sleeping, they are being denied kosher food, and they are suffering severe psychological pressure. As a result, Mr. Paz and Mr. Shvo have begun a hunger strike.  OMCT is gravely concerned for the psychological and physical well-being of Mr. Yiztak Paz and Mr. Mattityahu Shvo due to the conditions of their detention. OMCT reminds the Israeli authorities that the meeting between a prisoner and his lawyer, and his right to be represented by him, is a fundamental right which has statutory value, and is incorporated in International Law. OMCT asks that the order prohibiting the detainees from meeting with counsel be lifted immediately so that they can benefit from a fair legal process.  Action requested  Please write to the authorities in Israel/Occupied Territories urging them to:  i.   take all necessary measures to guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Yiztak Paz and Mr. Mattityahu Shvo; ii.  guarantee that the detainees are granted access to legal representation and family visits; iii. guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
