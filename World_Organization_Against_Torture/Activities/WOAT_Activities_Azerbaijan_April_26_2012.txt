The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint 
programme of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World 
Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent intervention in the 
following situation in Azerbaijan.
 
Description of the situation: 
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the 
arbitrary detention of Mr. Ogtay Gulaliyev, Coordinator of the “Kura” 
Civil Society Headquarter[1] and member of the 
Coalition for Improving Transparency in Extractive 
Industries.
 
According to the information received, on April 8, 2012, Mr. 
Gulaliyev was arrested by local policemen while he was participating in a public 
meeting with local residents of Minbashy, a village in Sabirabad region, to 
discuss about the protests these residents had been staging to demand a fairer 
repartition of State financial aids. Mr. Gulaliyev was subsequently transported 
to the Qaraguney police station, and then to the Sabirabad regional police 
administration.
 
On April 19, 2012, after having almost served the totality of a 
12-day administrative detention in Sabirabad regional police for having 
allegedly, according to local police, “sworn in a public place” (under Article 
296 (minor hooliganism) of the Code of Administrative Offences), he was charged 
through a decision of the Prosecutor of Sabirabad with “active resistance to 
authorities' legal orders” and “incitement to mass riots and to violence against 
citizens” (Article 220.2 of the Criminal Code), sanctionable with up to three 
years' imprisonment. 
 
On the same day, a two-months' detention in remand was approved by 
the regional judge. Mr. Gulaliyev appealed this decision, but the Shirvan Court 
of Appeal rejected the appeal. As of issuing this Urgent Appeal, Mr. Ogtay 
Gulaliyev remained detained in the remand prison of Kurdakhany village, near 
Baku, and the date of trial has not yet been scheduled.
 
At the time of his arrest, Mr. Gulaliyev had refused the lawyer selected by the authorities, and his 
request for another lawyer was rejected. As a result, he was sentenced to a 
two-months' detention in remand without legal advice. 
 
Moreover, Mr. Gulaliyev asserted that he was beaten during his 
detention by several police agents including Mr. Rauf Majidov, Deputy Chief of 
the Sabirabad district police department. On April 17, 2012, while in 
administrative detention, Mr. Ogtay Gulaliyev referred these abuses through 
advocate Alaif Hasanov to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, which officially 
stated that these first allegations of ill-treatment were “not confirmed”. In 
fact, no investigation has yet been carried out into these acts of ill-treatment 
against him.
 
The Observatory expresses its deep concern about the arbitrary detention and judicial harassment faced by Mr. 
Gulaliyev, as well as about the acts of ill-treatment against him, as they seem 
to only aim at sanctioning his human rights activities, and more particularly his activities of monitoring and struggle 
against corruption as well as his fight for a strengthened social 
justice.
 
Action requested:
 
Please write to the authorities in Azerbaijan, urging them to:
 
i.         
Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological 
integrity of Mr. Ogtay Gulaliyev as well as of all human rights defenders in 
Azerbaijan;
 
ii.       
Release immediately and unconditionally Mr. Ogtay Gulaliyev as his detention is arbitrary since it only aims at sanctioning his 
human rights activities.
 
iii.      
Put an end to any kind of harassment - including at the judicial and 
administrative levels - against Mr. Gulaliyev and more generally against all 
human rights defenders in Azerbaijan;
 
iv.      
Order a thorough and impartial investigation into the above-mentioned 
alleged acts of ill-treatment against Mr. Gulaliyev in order to identify all 
those responsible, bring them before a civil competent and impartial tribunal 
and apply to them the penal sanctions provided by the law;
 
v.        
Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights 
Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 
1998, especially its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, 
individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the 
protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the 
national and international levels”, as well as its Article 12.2, which provides 
that the State shall “take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the 
competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, 
against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse 
discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his 
or her legitimate exercise of his or her rights”; 
 
vi.      
 Ensure in all circumstances 
respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with 
international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by 
Azerbaijan.
