The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint
partnership of FIDH and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), has
received new information and requests your urgent intervention in the following
situation in Iran.
 
New information:
 
The Observatory has been informed by the League for the Defence of Human
Rights in Iran (LDDHI) about the continuing arbitrary detention and
ill-treatment of Mr. Farhad Mayssami (a.k.a Meysami), a medical doctor
who campaigned for women’s rights, including supporting a campaign against the
imposition of the hijab on women and girls, and defending women's rights to
choose their own clothing.
 
According to the information received, since he
was forcibly transferred from Tehran’s Evin prison’s Section 4 to the prison’s
clinic on September 26, 2018, Mr. Farhad Mayssami has been kept in solitary
confinement and administered intravenous fluid against his will. The
Observatory recalls that since August 1, Mr. Mayssami has been on a hunger
strike to protest against his arbitrary detention and to call for the
unconditional release of fellow human rights defenders Ms. Nasrin Sotoudeh[1]
and Mr. Reza Khandan[2].
His health is rapidly deteriorating and he has lost 34 kg since his arrest.
 
The Observatory expresses its deepest concern
regarding the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Farhad Mayssami and
condemns his arbitrary detention, which seems only aimed at punishing him for
his legitimate human rights activities.
 
The Observatory urges the Iranian authorities to
immediately and unconditionally release Mr.
Farhad Mayssami as well as to put an end to all acts of harassment, including at the judicial level,
against him and all human rights defenders arbitrarily detained in the country.
 
The Observatory further recalls that since
August 2018 several human rights defenders have been arbitrarily arrested for
defending women’s rights, and at least seven human rights lawyers have been
judicially harassed and/or arbitrarily detained for taking up cases related
to human rights and for representing other human rights lawyers prosecuted for
their work[3].
 
On November 29, 2018, five United Nations
Special Procedures called on Iran to “guarantee the rights of human rights
defenders and lawyers who have been jailed for publicly supporting protests
against the mandatory wearing of the hijab”
and expressed their particular concern over the critical health of Mr. Farhad
Mayssami[4].
 
Background information[5]:
 
On July 31, 2018, Mr. Farhad Mayssami was
arrested at his office in Tehran, following an order of the Prosecutor’s Office
Branch 2 and taken to the Ministry of Intelligence-run Ward 209 within Evin
prison. A friend of Ms. Nasrin Sotoudeh, Mr. Farhad Mayssami was arrested
for being in possession of copies of two books - “Small Acts of Resistance” by
Steve Crawshaw and John Jackson, and a book on human rights translated by
Mohammad Jafar Pouyandeh, a translator and writer assassinated by Ministry of
Intelligence agents in 1998 – and a number of badges reading “I am opposed to
forced hijab”. 
 
He faces charges of “gathering and colluding
against national security” (Article 610 of the Islamic Penal Code), “spreading
propaganda against the system” (Article 500) and “spreading prostitution”
(Article 286). 
 
Mr. Mayssami was not given access to a
lawyer of his choice as the authorities refused to allow Mr. Arash Kaykhosravi
to act as his lawyer, before the latter was arrested in front of the Parliament
on August 18, 2018[6].
 
On August 1, Mr. Mayssami started a hunger
strike to protest against his detention. He was kept in solitary confinement
for 20 days before being transferred to a dormitory ward in Section 4 of Evin
prison.
 
On
September 26, 2018, he was forcibly transferred by force to Evin prison’s clinic.

iii.

Rights Defenders adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 9, 1998, in
