In order to succeed we must do so within a system of accountability. The OSCE with its concept of comprehensive security and its participating States have a key role in ensuring that no concessions are made on the need to guarantee accountability. Terrorist acts need to be addressed with full respect for the absolute prohibition of torture, cruel and inhuman or degrading treatment and for human rights’, said Helena Solà Martín, Legal Advisor of the OMCT. In particular, OMCT has called upon the OSCE to conduct a thorough review of relevant laws an policies of its participating States with a view to increasing safeguards against torture and other human rights abuses, such as access to lawyers, independent medical counsel and judicial oversight and review. It has equally recalled the importance of guaranteeing that all actors involved in human rights violations while countering terrorism are held to account, including law enforcement and intelligence services actors. To read OMCT full oral statement, see document attached.
