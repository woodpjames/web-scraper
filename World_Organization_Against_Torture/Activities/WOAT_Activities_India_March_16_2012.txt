The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint 
programme of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and the International 
Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), has received new information and requests 
your urgent intervention in the following situation in 
India.
 
New information:
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources of the release 
on bail of Mr. Abhay Sahoo, President of the “POSCO Pratirodh Sangram 
Samiti” (PPSS), a movement that has been leading a six-year campaign against 
forcible acquisition of common lands by South Korean steel giant POSCO in Jagatsinghpur district, Odisha 
State (formerly Orissa State). 
 
According to the information received, on March 14, 2012, Mr. Abhay 
Sahoo was granted bail by the High Court of Odisha, and was released from 
Choudwar prison, Odisha State, at 5 pm.
 
The Observatory welcomes the release on bail of Mr. Abhay Sahoo and 
thanks all the persons, institutions and organisations who intervened 
in his favour. 
 
However, the Observatory is concerned that as of issuing this Urgent Appeal, it is not clear whether the charges 
against Mr. Abhay Sahoo remain pending, while Mr. Narayan Reddy, who has 
been leading the anti-POSCO campaign following the arrest of Mr. Sahoo on 
November 25, 2011, remains detained since December 23, 2011 in Samagol prison, Odisha State (See background information).
 
Background information:
 
On December 23, 2011, Mr. 
Narayan Reddy was arrested in the early morning 
near Japa Square in 
Erasama area of Jagatsinghpur district, Odisha, and taken to Kujang police 
station. He was then brought before a local court, which remanded him to 
judicial custody for two weeks after he was falsely charged with 
“murder”.
 
On January 9, 2012, a petition for 
release on bail of Mr. Narayan Reddy was rejected by the Additional 
District Session Judge of Jagatsinghpur, Mr. Sachidananda Sahu. 

 
Mr. Reddy is reportedly being held in connection with violent 
incidents that took place on December 15, 2011 at the proposed site of the POSCO 
steel plant, when workers of a contracting firm engaged in construction of an access 
coastal road for the POSCO plant, the Paradip Paribahan Company, broke barricades that villagers and protestors had peacefully 
erected, and attacked the villagers who turned violent. As a result, 
one person died and 25 protesting villagers were seriously injured 
during the clashes. Police teams arrived well after the attacks commenced and did not 
immediately intervene to prevent the clashes. 
 
It is to be mentioned that while Mr. Narayan Reddy, who has been leading the anti-POSCO campaign following the arrest of Mr. 
Abhay Sahoo on November 25, 2011, in the same context, participated in the peaceful protest on December 15, 2011, he was 
not directly involved in the clash.
 
Actions requested:
 
Please write to the authorities of India, urging them 
to:

integrity of Messrs. Narayan Reddy and Abhay Sahoo, of all PPSS members as well as of all human rights

ii.             Release Mr. Narayan Reddy immediately and unconditionally since his detention is arbitrary as it seems to 
merely sanction his human rights activities;

judicial level - against Messrs. Narayan Reddy and Abhay Sahu as well as against all human rights defenders in 
India;

Human Rights Defenders, in particular with its:

realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and 
international levels”;
-          Article 6(a), which foresees that “everyone has the right, 
individually and in association with others, to participate in peaceful 
activities against violations of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms”;
-          Article 12.2 (“the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure 
the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in 
association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de 
facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other 
arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the 
rights referred to in the present Declaration”);
 
v.             More generally, ensure in all circumstances the respect for human 
rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with in accordance with the
