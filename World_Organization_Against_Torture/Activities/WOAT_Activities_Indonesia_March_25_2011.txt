URGENT APPEAL- THE OBSERVATORY

Attack
Indonesia
March 25, 2011The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of
the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and the International Federation
for Human Rights (FIDH), has received new information and requests your urgent
intervention in the following situation in Indonesia.
Description of the situation:
The Observatory has
been informed by reliable sources of the brutal attack against Mr. Banjir Ambarita,
journalist, after the publication of several of his articles in the local
newspaper Bintang Papua of Jayapura, Papua province, and in the
Jakarta Globe, denouncing sexual abuses committed by police officers in Jayapura. 
According to the information received, on
March 3, 2011, Mr. Banjir Ambarita was riding his motorcycle in front of the Jayapura Mayor’s
office, when two unknown men on a motorcycle reportedly approached him, stabbed
him twice in the chest and stomach and fled. As he began to bleed, Mr. Banjir
Ambarita drove to the nearby police station. Police officers took him to the
Marthen Indey Hospital in Aryoko, Jayapura, where he underwent surgery. He has
reportedly recovered since then.
The Papua Regional
Police and the Jayapura Police have set up a joint force to investigate the
case, but to date, perpetrators remain unknown.
Mr. Banjir Ambarita had recently written articles in the Bintang
Papua and in the Jakarta Globe about two alleged rape cases
involving the police. 
In the first article, he had written that four police officers and three
civilians allegedly raped and tortured a 15 year old girl in February 2011, in
Biak, Papua province. The last article, dated February 27, 2011, covered a second case in
which three police officers forced a woman detainee to perform oral sex on them
from November 2010 to January 2011 at the Jayapura Police Detention Centre in
Papua province. The media coverage of this incident led to the resignation of
the Jayapura’s Police Chief, Mr. Imam Setiawan, and to the sentencing to 21
days of jail for the officers involved.
The Observatory expresses its deepest concern about the attack on Mr.
Banjir Ambarita, which seems to merely aim at sanctioning his denunciation of
human rights violations, and urges the authorities to ensure his protection and to promptly
investigate into the above-mentioned facts. 
Actions requested:
The Observatory urges the authorities of Indonesia to:
i.         
     Guarantee in all
circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Banjir Ambarita,
as well as all human rights defenders in Indonesia;
ii.        
   Carry out a prompt, effective,
thorough, independent and impartial investigation into the above-mentioned
events, the result of which must be made public, in order to prosecute and try
the perpetrators of these violations before a competent, independent and
impartial tribunal;
iii.       
     Conform in all circumstances
with the provisions of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted on
December 9, 1998 by the United Nations General Assembly, in particular:
-   Article 1, which states that “Everyone has
the right, individually or in association with others, to promote the
protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the
national and international levels”;
-         
Article 6, which provides that: “Everyone has the right,
individually and in association with others: (a) to know, seek, obtain, receive
and hold information about all human rights and fundamental freedoms (…); (b)
freely to publish, impart or disseminate to others views, information and knowledge on all human rights
and fundamental freedoms”; (c) to study, discuss, form and hold opinions on the observance, both in
law and in practice, of all human rights and fundamental freedoms and, through
these and other appropriate means, to draw public attention to those matters”,
-         
Article 12.2 which provides that “The State shall take all necessary
measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone,
individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats,
retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other
arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the
rights referred to in the present Declaration”;
iv.           
Ensure in
all circumstances the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in
accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with
international and regional human rights instruments ratified by Indonesia.
