New information: The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the release on bail of Mr. Abdolfattah Soltani, a lawyer at the Bar of Tehran and a founding member of the Defenders of Human Rights Centre (DHRC), According to the information received, on August 26, 2009, following the decision of the Security Branch of the Revolutionary Courts, Mr. Abdolfattah Soltani was released on payment of USD 100,000, following 70 days of arbitrary detention, including 17 days in solitary confinement without access to a shower. However, Mr. Abdolfattah Soltani remains accused of having acted against national security and no information could be obtained as to when he will be prosecuted. The Observatory welcomes Mr. Abdolfattah Soltani's release and wishes to thank all the persons, organisations, and institutions that intervened on her behalf. However, the Observatory remains concerned about the persistence of charges against him, which are related to his constant involvement in defending human rights in Iran.
