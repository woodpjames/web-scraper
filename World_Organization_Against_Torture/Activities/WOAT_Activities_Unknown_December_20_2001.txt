According to information received from the Red de Apoyo por la Justicia y la Paz, on 9 December 2001, an officer from the Metropolitan Police named Alí Gómez accompanied by a number of men entered the house of Roberto Tovar Pacheco, 45, in the neighbourhood of San Blas de Petare.  They twice threatened him with a gun.  On the same day at about 9.00pm, Alí Gómez drove in the same vehicle to the district of Dolorita vía Mariche Petare and outside the house of Marcos Esteban Mister, 46, rolled down the windows and stared menacingly at him before driving quickly away.  The two men are the fathers of the two young men killed, reportedly by members of the Metropolitan Police, on 30 June 2000.  According to the reports, both men became victims of death threats and psychological torture, purportedly by the Metropolitan  Police, since their decision to  denounce the failure of the justice system in relation with the deaths of their sons.  The first threats came on 11 September 2000, which, despite being reported to the Intelligence division of the Metropolitan Police, the Public Prosecutor of the republic and the People’s defence, have never been followed up by the authorities.  However, until today, the harassment had ceased.  According to the reports, the parents of the two boys claim that the root of the renewal of the threats is the reconstruction of the events which took place on 14 November 2001, attended by the members of the Metropolitan police present at the two boys’ hearing and the public prosecutor, Ms Irma Pazos de Fuenmayor.  The reports add that in the 18 months that have passed since this hearing, the responsibility for the acts has not been established, and that the two families are ready to continue their fight to bring the case to court and to prove the responsibility of the 8 accused members of the Metropolitan police.  The International Secretariat of the OMCT shares the serious concerns voiced by the la Red de Apoyo por la Justicia y la Paz for the security and physical and psychological integrity of Mr Marcos Esteban Mister and Mr  Roberto Tovar Pacheco.  Requested Action:  Please write to the Venezuelan Authorities urging them to:  i. take all measures necessary to guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of Mr Marcos Esteban Mister and Mr  Roberto Tovar Pacheco and to end their harassment; ii. order a thorough and impartial investigation into the deaths of their children and into the above.mentioned threats in order to identify those reponsible, bring them to justice and apply the civil, penal or adminstrative sanctions stipulted by law; iii. guarantee the respect of human rights and fundamental liberties in all the country in accordance with national law and international human rights norms.
