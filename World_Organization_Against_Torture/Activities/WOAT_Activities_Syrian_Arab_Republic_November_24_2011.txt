The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint 
programme of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World 
Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent intervention in the 
following situation in Syria.
 
Description of the situation :
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the 
arbitrarily arrest of Mr. Bahar Abd Razzaq, a member of the Syrian Organisation for Human Rights (Sawasiyya) 
who has denounced the bloody repression of the peaceful protest movement in 
Syria.
 
According to the information received, on November 18, 2011, Mr. 
Bahar Abd Razzaq was arbitrarily arrested by section 291 of the intelligence 
services of the army. He remains detained incommunicado as of issuing this 
Urgent Appeal.This arrest happened after three days of search of Mr. 
Bahar Abd Razzaq by section 291 of the intelligence services of the army, for a 
period of twelve hours each day. This reflects the determination of the 
authorities to track down human rights defenders in Syria.
 
The Observatory strongly condemns the arrest and continued 
incommunicado detention of Mr. Razzaq, as this measure seems to merely aim at sanctioning his 
human rights activities, and urges the authorities to disclose his whereabouts 
and to release him immediately and unconditionally.
 
Actions requested:
 
Please write to the Syrian authorities urging them to: 
 
i. Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological 
integrity of Mr. Bahar Abd Razzaq;
 
ii. Disclose the whereabouts of, and release immediately and 
unconditionally Mr. Bahar Abd Razzaq;
 
iii. Put an end to any kind of harassment - including at the judicial 
level - against Mr. Bahar Abd Razzaq as well as against all other individuals 
reporting human rights violations;
 
iv. Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights 
Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 
1998, especially: 
- its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, 
individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the 
protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the 
national and international levels”, 
- its Article 6 (b) and (c), which states that “Everyone has the 
right, individually and in association with others […] as provided for in human 
rights and other applicable international instruments, freely to publish, impart 
or disseminate to others views, information and knowledge on all human rights 
and fundamental freedoms and [...] to study, discuss, form and hold opinions on 
the observance, both in law and in practice, of all human rights and fundamental 
freedoms and, through these and other appropriate means, to draw public 
attention to those matters”.
- and its Article 12.2, which provides that “the State shall take all 
necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of 
everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, 
threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or 
any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of 
the rights referred to in the present Declaration”;
 
v. Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental 
freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and 
international instruments ratified by the Syrian Arab Republic.
