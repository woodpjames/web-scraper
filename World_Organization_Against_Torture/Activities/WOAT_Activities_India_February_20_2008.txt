Brief description of the situation: The Observatory has been informed by People’s Watch about the arbitrary arrest of Mr. Arumugam Katuraja Kanagaraj, a Dalit human rights activist and the District human rights monitor in Salem district (Tamil Nadu) of the National Project on Preventing Torture in India of People’s Watch. According to the information received, on February 15, 2008, at 7.30 am, henchmen of Mr. Moorthy, the President of Vellalapatti[1], beat up and arrested Mr. Kanagaraj at his house in Ganaesapuram, and brought him to Mr. Moorthy’s house, where they continued to beat him. The men then called the police station of Ethapur (Salem district), where a complaint was reportedly registered by Mr. Moorthy against Mr. Kanagaraj[2], and handed him over to police officers. It was reported that Mr. Kanagaraj would also have been beaten at the police station. On the morning of the same day, Mr. Utharapathy, the Police Inspector, and Mr. Baskaran, the Superintendent of Police of the Salem District, were immediately informed about this over phone by Mr. Henri Tiphagne, Executive Director of People’s Watch-Tamil Nadu. At around 5 pm, Mr. Kanagaraj was sent to the hospital of Salem, where he underwent a medical treatment for the injuries that resulted from all the beatings. As of now, Mr. Kanagaraj can be arrested at any moment by the police on the basis of the complaints filed by the President of Velalapatti. Furthermore, Mr. Moorthy and his henchmen have threatened members of Mr. Kanagaraj’s community that they would face dire consequences if they gave witness statement to the police in his favour. They would also have said that they would kill him once he comes back to the village. In the past, several cases and complaints had already been registered against Mr. Kanagaraj, and Mr. Moorthy also threatened him at several occasions after Mr. Kanagaraj registered a series of complaints against the President of Vellalapatti on a series of alleged irregularities committed in the framework of his functions, in particular corruption and bribery. The Observatory expresses its deepest concern about the arbitrary detention of Mr. Kanagaraj, as it seems to merely aim at sanctioning his human rights activities. Furthermore, the Observatory recalls that India was elected as a member of the Human Rights Council in 2007 for three years, and has committed, in this regard, to “uphold the highest standards of promotion and protection of human rights”[3]. Action requested: Please write to the Indian authorities and ask them to:   Take all necessary measures to guarantee, in all circumstances, the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Kanagaraj;  Order a thorough and impartial investigation into the above-mentioned allegations of ill-treatments, in order to identify all those responsible, bring them before a civil competent and impartial tribunal and apply to them the penal sanctions provided by the law;  Put an end to any act of harassment against Mr. Kanagaraj as well as against all human rights defenders in India;  Comply with the provisions of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 9, 1998, in particular Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually or collectively, to promote the protection and fulfilment of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, as well as Article 12.2, which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually or in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”;  Guarantee the respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and other international human rights instruments ratified by India.
