The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights
Defenders, a partnership of FIDH and the World Organisation Against Torture
(OMCT), has received new information and requests your urgent intervention in
the following situation in Cambodia.
 
New information: 


The Observatory has been informed by reliable
sources about the ongoing judicial harassment and arbitrary detention of Mr. Ny
Chakrya, former Head of the Human Rights and Monitoring Section of the
Cambodian Human Rights and Development Association (ADHOC) and now Deputy
Secretary-General of the National Election Committee (NEC), as well as of four
ADHOC staff members, Messrs. Ny Sokha,
Yi Soksan, Nay Vanda, and Ms. Lim Mony.
 
According to the
information received, on October 28, 2016, the Phnom Penh Municipal Court
denied bail to Messrs. Ny Chakrya, Ny Sokha, Yi Soksan, Nay Vanda, and Ms. Lim
Mony and extended their pre-trial detention for up to six more months on the
pretext that the five defendants needed to remain at hand for any further
interrogation and court procedures.
 
The Observatory considers
that the court’s refusal to release the five detained human rights
defenders on bail is a significant obstacle to the exercise of their basic
rights, including the fundamental right to liberty and the right to
a fair trial.
 The Observatory recalls that the five human rights
defenders have been arbitrarily detained since May 2, 2016, on charges of “bribery
of a witness” (Article 548 of the Criminal Code) for Messrs.
Ny Sokha, Nay Vanda, Yi Soksan and Ms. Lim Mony, and being
an “accomplice to bribery of a witness” (Articles 29 and 548 of the
Criminal Code) for Mr. Ny Chakrya, for providing legal and material assistance
to a client. If convicted, the five could face from five to ten years in
prison.
 
The Observatory further
recalls that on September 22, 2016, the Phnom Penh Municipal Court sentenced
Mr. Ny Chakrya to six months in
prison and a six-million-Riel (about 1,310 Euros) fine in relation to another
criminal case[1]. Mr. Ny Chakrya filed an appeal against his
conviction.
 
The Observatory strongly condemns the ongoing
arbitrary detention of Messrs. Ny Chakrya, Ny Sokha, Yi Soksan, Nay Vanda, and
Ms. Lim Mony, which only aims at sanctioning their legitimate human rights
activities, and calls upon the Cambodian authorities to immediately and
unconditionally release the five human rights defenders.
 
Until their
unconditional release, the Observatory further urges the Cambodian authorities
to ensure that all judicial proceedings against them are carried out in full
compliance with their right to a fair trial, as protected under international
law.
 
Background
information:
 
On April 27 and 28, 2016, five staff members
of ADHOC - Mr. Ny Sokha (Head of the Human Rights Section), Mr. Nay Vanda
(Deputy Head of the Human Rights Section), Mr. Yi Soksan (Senior
Investigator of the Land and Natural Resources Section), Mr. Try Chhuon
(lawyer), and Ms. Lim Mony (Senior Investigator of the Women’s
Rights Section) - as well as Mr. Ny Chakrya were brought in for
questioning by the Anti-Corruption Unit (ACU). UNOHCHR official Soen Sally, who was also summoned, did
not appear before the ACU due to his immunity as a UN staff member.
 
On May 2, 2016, following five to six
days of questioning by the ACU and then by the Prosecutor, Messrs.
Ny Sokha, Nay Vanda, Yi Soksan, and Ms. Lim Mony were
charged with “bribery of a witness” under Article 548 of the Criminal
Code and detained. In addition, Messrs. Ny Chakrya and Soen
Sally were charged as “accomplices to bribery of a witness” (Articles
29 and 548 of the Criminal Code). Mr. Ny Chakrya was also detained.
 
The charges were related to
a complaint signed by Ms. Khom Chandaraty (also known as Ms.
Srey Mom), which was lodged following her questioning in March 2016
by anti-terrorism police and a prosecutor about an alleged affair with
deputy opposition leader Mr. Khem Sokha, after ADHOC responded to Ms.
Srey Mom’s request for legal and material assistance - a US$204
allowance to cover food and transport costs. This legitimate support,
aimed at covering the basic expenses of a client, was construed by the ACU
as bribery and corruption.
 
On June 13, 2016, the Court of Appeals in Phnom
Penh denied bail to Messrs. Ny Chakrya, Ny Sokha, Nay Vanda, Yi Soksan,
and Ms. Lim Mony.
 
Messrs. Ny Sokha, Nay Vanda, and Yi Soksan
remain detained in Prey Sar’s Correctional Center 1 (‘CC1’), while Ms. Lim
Mony is detained in Prey Sar’s Correctional Center 2 (‘CC2’). Mr. Ny
Chakrya is detained in Police Judiciare (PJ) prison. All three jails are
located in Phnom Penh. All of the detainees are being held
alongside convicted criminals, contrary to Article 10(2)(a) of the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights, and Article 26 of Cambodia’s Law on Prisons.
 
Actions requested:
 
Please write to the authorities of the Kingdom of
Cambodia asking them to:
 
i. Put an end to all forms of harassment, including
at the judicial level, against Messrs. Ny Chakrya, Ny Sokha, Yi Soksan, Nay
Vanda, and Ms. Lim Mony and all human rights defenders in the country so that they are able to
carry out their work without hindrance;
 
ii. Guarantee in all circumstances their physical
and psychological integrity as well as of all human rights defenders in
Cambodia;
 
iii. Immediately
and unconditionally release Messrs.
Ny Chakrya, Ny Sokha, Yi Soksan, Nay Vanda, and Ms. Lim Mony as their detention
is arbitrary since it only aims at sanctioning their human rights activities;
 
iv. Comply with all the provisions of the UN
Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the United Nations General
Assembly on December 9, 1998, in particular with its Articles 1, 5(b) and 12.2;
 
v. Guarantee the respect of human rights and
fundamental freedoms in accordance with the Universal Declaration on Human
Rights and other international human rights instruments signed or ratified by
the Kingdom of Cambodia.
