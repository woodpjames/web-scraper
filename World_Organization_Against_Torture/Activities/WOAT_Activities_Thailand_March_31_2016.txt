The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of
the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and the International Federation
for Human Rights (FIDH), requests your urgent intervention in the following
situation in Thailand. 
 
Brief description of the situation:
 
The
Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the judicial harassment
against members of the Khon
Rak Ban Kerd Group (KRBKG), a community-based group committed to defend the
local environment from the negative impacts of the open-pit copper-gold mine,
operated by the Tungkum company in Thailand’s Loei province[1].

According to
the information received, on March 30, 2016, the Loei Provincial Court dismissed a civil defamation
lawsuit brought by the mining company Tungkum against Mr. Suraphan
Rujichaiwat, Ms. Viron Rujichaiwat,
Mr. Khonglai Phakmi, Mr. Samai Phakmi, Ms. Pornthip Hongchai, and Ms. Mon
Khunna - six KRBKG members who are living in communities near the open-pit
copper-gold mine - for erecting signs last year at the Na Nong Bong village
entrance gate and along the main road in the village, calling for the closure
of the controversial mine and rehabilitation of the local
environment. Tungkum Ltd. was seeking 50 million Thai Baht (EUR 1,274,000) in compensation from the six KRBKG members for
alleged damage to the company’s reputation.
 
The Observatory welcomes yesterday’s decision, but
remains concerned that at least 25 other villagers who oppose the mine’s
operations are still facing eight criminal and civil cases brought by Tungkum.
 
Tungkum has brought at least 19 criminal and civil
lawsuits against 33 members of the KRBKG and other villagers in the past seven
years, including the case dismissed yesterday. Through these lawsuits, the
company has sought a total of 320 million Thai Baht (EUR 8,156,000) from villagers who opposed the mine.
 
On March 10, the company dropped a separate criminal
defamation complaint against Mr. Suraphan Rujichaiwat, who was accused of
harming the company’s reputation by posting on Facebook a petition letter
demanding an investigation into the legality of the mining concession and the
transport of ore from the mine site. In that case, Mr. Suraphan faced up to one
year in prison or a fine of up to 20,000 Thai Baht (EUR 510) under Section 326
of the Thai Criminal Code as well as up to five years’ imprisonment or a fine
of up to 100,000 Thai Baht (EUR 2,550) under the Computer Crimes Act.

The
Observatory expresses concern for the numerous defamation-related charges
brought by the company Tungkum
against villagers and members of KRBKG for defending the local environment from
negative impacts of the gold mine, and urges the company to immediately drop
all lawsuits against them.

[1] Villagers from six communities near the mine formed
the KRBKG in 2007 to advocate for a clean environment and to oppose the mining
operations. On March 7, the National Human Rights Commission of Thailand
honoured women of the KRBKG with a prestigious human rights defenders award for their role in bringing attention to
critical human rights problems in Thailand.
