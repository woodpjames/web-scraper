Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Sudanese Victims of Torture Group (SVTG), a member of the OMCT network, that the Government of Sudan has once again resumed the use of amputation as punishment.  According to the information SVTG received on March 23, 2000, a Sudanese citizen named Al Salik Obeid had his right hand and left foot amputated, earlier this month in Kober prison.  SVTG's sources received information from Buri Police Hospital that Al Salik Obeid was admitted on March 3, 2000 for 24 hours and he returned in a few days for a follow-up visit.  According to the information, Mr Al Salik Obeid is still in Kober Prison at this time.  Al Salik was charged under Articles 167 & 168, "Armed Robbery" (Haraba). The other person charged alongside Al Salik has been in prison for 7 years.  In addition, SVTG's sources confirmed that the following individuals have been sentenced to amputation of their left hand, under Article 174 of the Criminal Act, 1991, but at the moment it has not been confirmed that the punishment has been carried out;  1. Ismail Khidir 2- Jad Alla Adam Mohamed 3- Majzoob Mohamed Issa 4- Nattid Is'hag Mudathir 5- Jad Al rab Kuku 6- Nagar Kafi Goona 7- Alnour Mohamed Idris 8- Abd Algayoom Issa 9- Husham Ahmed 10- Mohamed Abd Alla Adam 11- Mohamed Adam Abd Almajeed 12-Sharief Obied Osman  The International Secretariat of OMCT reiterates SVTG's deep concern that the Government of Sudan has once again resumed the punishment of amputation.  Furthermore, that this punishment is against the Government of Sudan's international obligations, with regard the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as well as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention Against Torture both ratified by Sudan.  OMCT recalls the concluding observations of the Human Rights Committee: Sudan (1997) that ‘By ratifying the Covenant [on Civil and Political Rights], the State party has undertaken to comply with all its articles; penalties which are inconsistent with articles 7 and 10 must be abolished.’  Action requested  Please write to the authorities in Sudan urging them to:  i.	take all necessary measures to guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of the above-mentioned persons; ii.	immediately stop the inhuman practice of amputation and abolish the use of amputation as a method of punishment, which is enacted within the Sudanese Criminal Act 1991. iii.	guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards, and conform to all recommendations made by the Human Rights Committee.
