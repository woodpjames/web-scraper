Dr. Shadi al-Ghazali Harb has been advocating for the release of detained demonstrators and for the improvement of detention conditions.   According to the information received, on May 15, 2018, Dr. Shadi al-Ghazali Harb was arrested after he presented himself to the office of the general prosecution in Giza where he had been summoned by a warrant from the North Giza Court. Although he was initially granted a 50 000 EGP bail (approx. 2 400 Euros), he was then transferred to the Dokki police station where he was detained overnight. The following day, on May 16, 2018 the State Security Prosecution ordered his detention for 15 days pending investigation into charges of case no. 621 of 2018. His pre-trial detention has since been renewed four times. He is being accused of “joining a group established in violation to the provisions of the law and the constitution with the aim to disrupt state institutions, spread false news, and humiliating the President”. Dr. Shadi al-Ghazali Harb is being detained in solitary confinement at Qanater prison, where he does not have regular access to his family and lawyers. During the first fifteen days of his detention, he was denied access to a bed and he was not allowed to go outdoors. Dr. Shadi al-Ghazali Harb’s detention occurs within a wave of arrests targeting human rights defenders since May 2018 including Ms. Amal Fathy[1]who is also targeted under case no. 621 of 2018, Mr. Wael Abbas[2]and Mr. Haytham Mohamadein[3], all detained on trumped up terrorism related charges. The Observatory condemns in the strongest terms this renewed crackdown targeting human rights defenders. The Observatory urges the Egyptian authorities to immediately and unconditionally release Dr. Shadi al-Ghazali Harb, Ms. Amal Fathy, Mr. Wael Abbas and Mr. Haytham Mohamadein as their detention is arbitrary. Until then, Egyptian authorities must guarantee their psychological and physical integrity. The Observatory further urges the Egyptian authorities to put an end to all forms of harassment against them, including at the judicial level and to refrain from further punishing their peaceful and legitimate human rights activities under trumped up, terrorism related charges. Actions requested: Please write to the authorities of Egypt asking them to: i.Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Dr. Shadi al-Ghazali Harb, Ms. Amal Fathy, Mr. Wael Abbas and Mr. Haytham Mohamadein, their relatives and all human rights defenders in Egypt; ii. Immediately and unconditionally release Dr. Shadi al-Ghazali Harb, Ms. Amal Fathy, Mr. Wael Abbas and Mr. Haytham Mohamadeinas their detention is arbitrary as it is merely aimed at punishing them for their human rights activities; iii. Put an end to all acts of harassment, including at the judicial level, against Dr. Shadi al-Ghazali Harb, Ms. Amal Fathy, Mr. Wael Abbas and Mr. Haytham Mohamadeinand all human rights defenders in Egypt, and ensure that they are able to carry out their activities without hindrance;  iv. Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially Articles 1, 6(c) and 12.2; and v.
