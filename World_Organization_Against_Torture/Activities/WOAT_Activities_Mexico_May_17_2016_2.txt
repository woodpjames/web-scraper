As human rights organisations working on Mexico, we recognise the important work of the Inter-
Disciplinary Group of Independent Experts (Grupo Interdisciplinario de Expertos y Expertas
Independientes, GIEI) to investigate the case of the 43 disappeared students from Ayotzinapa teaching
college and welcome their final report presented on April 24, 2016.

Established in November 2014 as an agreement among the Inter-American Commission on Human
Rights (IACHR), the students’ families and representatives, and the Mexican government, the GIEI
published a preliminary report in September 2015 that substantially disproved the Mexican
government’s official version of the disappearances and proposed further lines of investigation.

The final report underscores grave shortcomings in the follow-up of these proposed key lines of
investigation and highlights grave concerns, including the manipulation of evidence, and torture of
suspects to secure confessions. The Mexican government denied a request from the families of the
disappeared to further extend the GIEI’s mandate in order to continue their investigation.







The Mexican government has committed publicly to ensure that investigations do not cease until justice
is done, and to develop, in cooperation with the IACHR, a special monitoring mechanism for follow up
on this and other cases of enforced disappearances. The case of the 43 students from Ayotzinapa is
emblematic of a larger crisis of enforced disappearance in Mexico, with tens of thousands of people
disappeared to date. The Mexican authorities urgently need to step up efforts to search for the
disappeared and to carry out effective investigations that result in victims being identified and those
responsible punished.

Two members of the GIEI attended a hearing of the European Parliament’s (EP) Sub-Committee for
Human Rights (DROI) in March 2016. They outlined the findings of their first report and welcomed the
possibility to provide a further briefing following the publication of the GIEI final report.

As Mexico and the EU prepare for the annual EU-Mexico Human Rights Dialogue scheduled to take place
in Brussels on 21 June 2016, we call on the European institutions to join the GIEI in its strong public
demands for an end to impunity for enforced disappearance in Mexico and to support the families of
the victims. They should:


Ensure a full and public briefing from the GIEI in the European Parliament and commit to a
follow-up resolution to the October 2014 EP resolution on Ayotzinapa


Maintain full support for an independent and impartial investigation of the Ayotzinapa case and
follow up to all of the recommendations of the GIEI’s preliminary and final reports


Urge the Mexican government to support the IACHR's efforts to develop an effective and
independent monitoring mechanism


Express concern to the Mexican government about the risk to families of the disappeared and
their legal representatives, which has worsened in recent months


Reiterate the recommendations of the GIEI’s report during the upcoming Human Rights
Dialogue and place human rights at the centre of joint work on the revised Global Agreement
and on the Security and Justice dialogue


Commit to advance the joint projects agreed to by the EU and Mexico during last year's Human
Rights Dialogue, including EU funded technical support and programming to reinforce the work
of the Mexican government on torture, enforced disappearances, and human rights defenders.
