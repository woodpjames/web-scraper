Brief description of the situation  The Observatory has been informed that, on 28 August 2002, Mr. Sergey Duvanov, chief editor of the news bulletin "Human rights in  Kazakhstan and in the world" published by the Kazakhstan-based  International Bureau for Human Rights and the Rule of Law (KIBHRL), was attacked and severely beaten by three unidentified persons in  front of his home in Almaty.   According to the information received, Mr. Duvanov lost consciousness  several times and was still unconscious when he was found by his  neighbours and was sent to hospital. A judicial investigation has been  opened into his physical assault.  The Observatory recalls that on 9 July, Mr. Duvanov, who also writes for opposition web sites, was summoned to the Almaty office of the  National Security Committee (KNB) and informed that a criminal case  had been brought against him by the General Prosecutor's Office for "infringing the honor and dignity of the President". He risks a three-year prison sentence under article 318 of the Kazakh Criminal Code.    These legal proceedings are linked to one of his articles dated 6 May  and entitled "Silence of the Lambs" related to corruption issues  involving the Kazakh President and his associates. Following the  interrogation, investigators searched Duvanov's apartment and  KIBHRL's office and confiscated computers along with articles and  other documentation. On 11 July, the journalist was subjected to  another interrogation which lasted nearly four hours.  The Observatory underlines that this attack against Duvanov takes  place in a context of threats, intimidation and violence against  human rights activists and independent journalists, in particular  those who investigate and denounce corruption cases.   Actions requested:   Please write to the Kazakh authorities urging them to:  i.
