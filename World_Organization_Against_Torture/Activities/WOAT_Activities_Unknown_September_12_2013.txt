Joint NGO Open Letter to Member States of the UNGA re: Treaty Body
Strengthening , 12 September 2013


The end of the 67th session of the United Nations General Assembly is fast
approaching. States have an important opportunity to conclude the
intergovernmental process on treaty body strengthening that was established in
February 2012 through the adoption of resolution 66/254. The non-governmental
organizations listed below call on all States to decide now to conclude the process
in December 2013.

This is a key opportunity for States to take the necessary substantive and
budgetary decisions to strengthen the system without further delay. States have
debated some good proposals in the context of the intergovernmental process.
Many of these will require budgetary action by the General Assembly and thus
need to be finalised in time to be included in the general budget for 2014-15.

For years, the treaty bodies have faced many challenges in fulfilling their
mandates, including through backlogs, insufficient meeting time, non-reporting and
lack of implementation. These challenges continue, with the High Commissioner
for Human Rights describing the system as having reached its limits.

We therefore call on States to conclude the process by the end of the year so that
those initiatives that enjoy broad support can be implemented to the benefit of the
treaty bodies and rights holders everywhere.
