New information: The Observatory has been informed by the Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum and the Zimbabwe Human Rights Association (Zimrights) of the release on bail of Ms. Jestina Mukoko, Executive Director of the Zimbabwe Peace Project (ZPP) and Board Member of the Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum[1]. According to the information received, on March 2, 2009, Ms. Jestina Mukoko was released on bail by the Harare Magistrates Court's decision, on payment of 600 US dollars. Mr. Pascal Gonzo, ZPP driver, and Mr. Broderick Tarawira, ZPP Provincial Coordinator, had been released on bail by the High Court of Zimbabwe on February 6 and February 26, 2009 respectively. The Observatory welcomes the release on bail of Ms. Jestina Mukoko, Mr. Pascal Gonzo and Mr. Broderick Tarawira and wishes to thank all the persons, organisations, and institutions that intervened on their behalf. The Observatory expresses however its concern about the charges that still remain pending against Ms. Mukoko and Mr. Tarawira, and about the subsequent stringent conditions placed on their release, as they are supposed to report to their nearest police stations twice a week and were forced to surrender some title deeds as well as their passports. Under the terms of their bail, Ms. Mukoko and Mr. Tarawira are also denied the right to change their residences until the issuance of a verdict. The Observatory is further concerned about the health conditions of Ms. Jestina Mukoko and Mr. Brorick Tarawira, who are presently recovering at a local private hospital. Background information Ms. Mukoko was abducted by a group of 15 unidentified armed men on December 3, 2008 from her home in Norton, and has allegedly undergone serious acts of torture. On December 8, 2008, Messrs. Broderick Takawira and Pascal Gonzo were also abducted by at least five men at the ZPP offices in Harare. Ms. Mukoko and Mr. Broderick’s whereabouts had remained unknown until December 24, 2008, when they first appeared before the Harare Magistrates Court, after weeks of incommunicado detention. On January 5 and 6, 2008, Ms. Mukoko, Mr. Gonzo and Mr. Takawira, accused by the Government of “recruiting or goading other people to undergo military training in neighbouring Botswana aimed at toppling Robert Mugabe’s Government”, appeared before the Harare Magistrates Court. The hearing in Ms. Mukoko and Mr. Takawira's case was then postponed, pending a decision of the High Court on an application demanding further medical examination in a well-equipped hospital, as they reportedly bear signs of torture and ill-treatment. The Observatory was further informed that throughout the first ten days of her detention, Ms. Mukoko was not allowed to take medication for an allergic condition she has, and has also learned with concern that she had been prescribed medication for anxiety and insomnia by an army doctor who facilitated acts of torture against her. Ms. Mukoko called for a toxicology report, fearing that the Zimbabwe Government might be trying to poison her. Actions required: Please write to the authorities of Zimbabwe urging them to:   Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Broderick Takawira, Mr. Pascal Gonzo, and Ms. Jestina Mukoko, as well as of all human rights defenders in Zimbabwe;  Order an immediate, thorough and impartial investigation into the above-mentioned allegations of torture and ill-treatments, in order to identify all those responsible, bring them before a competent and impartial tribunal and apply to them the penal sanctions provided by the law;  Put an end to all kinds of harassment against them - including at the judicial level - as well as against all human rights defenders in Zimbabwe;  Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually or collectively, to promote the protection and fulfilment of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, as well as above-mentioned Article 12.2 (“the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure);  Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by Zimbabwe.
