Lack of due diligence by the police/ Fear for the
safety/ Risk of impunity 
The International Secretariat of the World
Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) requests your URGENT intervention in
the following situation in India/ West Bengal. 
Brief description of the situation
The International Secretariat of OMCT has been
informed by Banglar Manabadhikar Suraksha Mancha (MASUM),
a member of OMCT SOS-Torture Network, about the alleged rape of the
about 16- year-old girl Guria Halder
(name changed) from the village of Simulpur, West Bengal, and the subsequent
alleged assault faced by her mother.
According to the information received, Mr
Monoranjan Majumdar is facing criminal charges for the alleged rape of
Guria Halder in 2010 (Gaighata Police Station Case no. 284/2010 dated
31.8.2010). The suspect was arrested, but later released on bail. Since his
release, he is threatening Guria Halder and her family pressuring them to
withdraw the complaint against him. The victim’s family filed again a complaint
against Mr Monoranjan Majumdar for threatening them (Gaighata Police Station
Case no. 643/2011 dated 9.11.2011), but the police has up to date not
undertaken any action.           
On 1 December 2011 around 6:30 pm, Mr. Manjoranjan
Mazumdar accompanied by Mr. Rabi Roy and Mr. Suranjan Roy allegedly
stopped Ms Kajal
Halder, the mother of the alleged rape victim Guria Halder,
while she was returning from the market. She was threatened in order to force
her to withdraw the earlier rape complaint against Mr. Manoranjan Mazumdar. When
Ms Kajal Halder did openly disagree with the three men, they brought an iron
rod from a nearby shop and hit her fiercely on the head, hands and legs. As a
result of the assault Ms Kajal Halder fell to the ground unconscious and the
assailants left the spot. Ms Kajal Halder was taken to the hospital.
After several attempts by the daughter Guria Halder
and subsequently by the mother Kajal Halder to report the incident to the
police, the police finally filed a complaint against the three men, but
allegedly under a lighter penal provision than the serious allegations would
demand, so that the men could obtain bail. The men are currently out on bail
further jeopardizing the physical and psychological integrity of the family
Halder, including both victims. 
OMCT is gravely concerned
about the reports that the investigation officer of the Gaighata Police Station is yet to
complete the investigation of the rape case and the impunity enjoyed by the perpetrator.
The reported violence faced by both women is sufficiently serious to pursue a
thorough investigation to protect the family Halder against further
threats.  
OMCT would like to
reiterate that the State has an obligation under international law to prevent,
prosecute and punish acts of violence with due diligence, irrespective of
whether these acts have been committed by State or non-State actors.  
Action requested
Please write to the authorities in India/ West Bengal urging them to:
i.                    
Guarantee, in all circumstances, the physical and psychological
integrity of the victims, including
access to appropriate medical assistance if necessary, and ensure her
protection as well as of her family;
ii.                  
Carry out
a prompt, effective, thorough, independent and impartial investigation
into the above-mentioned allegations, in accordance with international human
rights standards, the result of which must be made public, in order to bring
those responsible before a competent, independent and impartial tribunal and
apply penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions as provided by law;
iii.                 
Ensure that an effective remedy, including the right to full redress
with compensation and rehabilitation be granted to the victim concerned;
iv.                
Ensure the respect of human rights and
fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws
and international human rights standards.
