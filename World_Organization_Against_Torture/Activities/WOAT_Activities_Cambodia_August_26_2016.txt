The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint
partnership of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and FIDH, requests
your urgent intervention in the following situation in Cambodia.
 
Description of the
situation:
 
The Observatory has been informed by
reliable sources of the sentencing of Ms. Tep Vanny and Ms. Bov Sophea, two Boeung Kak Lake activists, in relation to their
participation in a peaceful protest to call for the release of five imprisoned
human rights defenders.

According to the information received, on August 22,
2016, Ms. Tep Vanny and Ms. Bov Sophea were
convicted of “insulting a public official” and sentenced to six days in prison.

 
The
two activists were arrested on August 15, 2016, while
participating in a peaceful vigil, which was held by the Boeung Kak Lake
community in Phnom Penh to mark the 15th week of the ‘Black Monday’
campaign. The campaign involves weekly peaceful protests, held on Mondays, where
participants wear black clothing to call for the release of human rights
defenders Mr. Ny Sokha, Mr. Yi Soksan, Mr. Nay Vanda, Ms. Lim Mony,
and Mr. Ny Chakrya, as well as for
justice for the recent murder of prominent political analyst and ‘Black Monday’
supporter Kem Ley[1]. Spanish researcher Ms. Marga Bujosa Segado, who was also
taking part in the ‘Black Monday’ demonstration, was also arrested and
subsequently deported from Cambodia on August 17, for allegedly not possessing a
work permit.
 
Following their arrest, Ms. Tep Vanny and Ms. Bov
Sophea were initially detained at the Daun Penh district
police station before being sent to pre-trial detention in Prey Sar’s CC2
prison in Phnom Penh on August 17.
 
On August 17, 2016, Ms. Tep Vanny and Ms. Bov Sophea were charged
with “incitement” under Article 495 of Cambodia’s
Criminal Code, after a day of interrogation at Phnom Penh’s Municipal Court.
The two were immediately sent to trial, which was adjourned until August 22. 
 
On
August 22, following a 90-minute trial and after just 18 minutes of
deliberation, presiding Judge Pech Vicheator unexpectedly changed the charge to
“insult of a public official” (Article 502 of the Criminal Code) during the
delivery of his verdict. After presenting a defence against the original charge
of incitement, the defendants’ lawyers were given no opportunity to prepare a
defence against the new charge.
 
While Ms.
Bov Sophea was released on the evening of August 22 after serving six days in
detention, Ms. Tep Vanny was transported to Prey Sar’s CC2 prison, due to an
additional charge against her. On August 19, the Phnom Penh Municipal Court charged
her with “intentional violence with aggravating circumstances” (Article 218 of
the Criminal Code). The charge stemmed from Ms. Tep Vanny’s participation in a
protest near Prime Minister Hun Sen’s house in 2013 to call for the release of
then-jailed activist Ms. Yorm Bopha[2].
The protest ended in one of the most violent crackdowns against the community,
leaving five citizens injured, including some with broken bones. If found
guilty, Ms. Tep Vanny could face from two to five years in prison.
 
The Observatory strongly condemns the arrest and sentencing of Ms. Tep
Vanny and Ms. Bov Sophea, as well as Ms. Tep Vanny’s ongoing arbitrary
detention, which only aims at sanctioning their legitimate human rights
activities. The Observatory further recalls that under Cambodia’s
Code of Criminal Procedure, pre-trial detention can only be ordered in
“exceptional” circumstances.
 
The
Observatory calls upon the Cambodian authorities to
put an end to their harassment and to immediately and unconditionally release
Ms. Tep Vanny. 
 
Until
all charges are dropped against Ms. Tep Vanny,
the Observatory urges the Cambodian authorities to ensure that all judicial
proceedings against her are conducted in full compliance with her right to a
fair trial, as provided for under international law. 
 
Finally,
the Observatory urges the Cambodian authorities to
abide by the joint call issued on May 12, 2016, by four United Nations Special
Rapporteurs “to stop targeting civil society, human rights defenders (…) and to
take effective measures to protect civil society and respect fundamental
freedoms in the country”[3].
 
Actions requested:
 
Please write to the authorities of Cambodia
asking them to:
 
i.   
Guarantee in all circumstances the
physical and psychological integrity of Ms. Tep Vanny, as well as of Messrs. Ny Sokha, Nay Vanda, Yi Soksan,
Ny Chakrya, Ms. Lim
Mony, and all human rights defenders in Cambodia;
 
ii.  
Immediately and unconditionally
release Ms. Tep Vanny and Ms. Lim Mony, Messrs. Ny Sokha, Nay Vanda, Yi Soksan,
and Ny Chakrya as their arbitrary detention
is merely aimed at sanctioning their legitimate human rights activities;
 
iii. Put an end to all acts of harassment – including at the judicial level –
against Ms. Tep Vanny, Ms. Bov
Sophea, Ms. Lim Mony and
Messrs. Ny Sokha, Nay Vanda, Yi Soksan, and Ny Chakrya, as
well as against all human rights defenders in Cambodia so that they are able to
carry out their work without hindrance or fear of reprisals;
 
iv.  Comply
with all the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders,
adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on December 9, 1998, in
particular with its Articles 1, 5(b), and 12.2;
 
v.  
More generally, ensure in all circumstances the respect for human rights
and fundamental freedoms in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights and with international and regional human rights instruments ratified by
Cambodia.
