The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint
programme of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World
Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent intervention in the
following situation in Bahrain.
Description of the situation:
The Observatory has been informed
by reliable sources about the new arbitrary arrest of Mr. Nabeel Rajab, President of the Bahrain Centre
for Human Rights (BCHR), FIDH Deputy Secretary General and a member of the
Advisory Committee of Human Rights Watch's Middle East Division.
According to the information received, on April 2, 2015, at 4:00 pm,
over twenty police cars surrounded Mr. Rajab's house and policemen
arrested him on charges of “spreading false news”. Mr. Rajab was then sent to
the General Directorate of Anti Corruption Economic and Electronic Security to
be interrogated.
The arrest relates a tweet from Mr.
Rajab denouncing the torture of detainees at Jaw Prison[1].
The Observatory denounces the new arbitrary arrest and detention of Mr.
Nabeel Rajab, and calls for his immediate and unconditional release, as he is
targeted solely for his human rights activities.
The Observatory is extremely concerned about the fact that Mr. Rajab has
been facing continuous judicial harassment and has already spent more than two
years in jail since 2012 (see background information).
The Observatory more generally urges the Bahraini
authorities to put an end to all acts of harassment against Mr. Rajab, and to
comply with relevant international human rights standards and instruments, in
particular the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of 1966,
and the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the UN General
Assembly on December 9, 1998.
Background information:
Mr. Rajab has faced continuous judicial harassment for his legitimate
human rights work since his first arrest in June 2012[2].
Mr. Rajab was sentenced to three months imprisonment for allegedly libelling
the residents of Al Muharraq via several tweets posted on his twitter account.
On August 23, 2012, Mr. Nabeel Rajab was acquitted by the Higher Appeal Court.
On August 16, 2012, the Lower Criminal Court sentenced Mr. Nabeel Rajab
to three years of imprisonment in relation to three cases related to his
participation in peaceful gatherings in favour of fundamental freedoms and
democracy
In December 2012, the Appeals Court reduced the sentence to two years of
imprisonment. Mr. Nabeel Rajab completed his sentence and was released in June
2014.
On October 1, 2014, Mr. Nabeel Rajab was summoned by the General
Directorate of Anti-corruption and Economic and Electronic Security of the
Criminal Investigation Department for “insulting a public institution” via
Twitter. 
On October 9, 2014, Mr. Nabeel Rajab was informed that the Ministry of
Defence had filed a complaint regarding the same tweet. On November 2, 2014,
the Third Lower Criminal Court ordered Mr. Rajab’s release but barred him from
leaving the country.
On January 20, 2015, the Third Lower Criminal Court sentenced Mr. Nabeel
Rajab to six months of imprisonment on charges of “insulting public
institutions and the army” via Twitter. Mr. Rajab’s lawyers appealed the
sentence.
The Bahrain Criminal Court of Appeal is due to issue its verdict on
April 15, 2015. 
On February 26, 2015, Mr. Rajab was summoned for investigations in a
different case for charges of “inciting hatred towards the regime”. To date,
the police investigation was ongoing.
Actions requested: 

The Observatory urges the authorities of Bahrain to:

Immediately and
unconditionally release Mr. Nabeel Rajab, as he is targeted solely for his
human rights activities;


Guarantee the
physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Nabeel Rajab and that of all
human rights defenders in Bahrain;


Put an end to
any act of harassment, including at the judicial level, against Mr. Nabeel
Rajab and against all human rights defenders in Bahrain;


Conform in any
circumstances with the provisions of the Declaration on Human Rights
Defenders, adopted on December 9, 1998 by the United Nations General
Assembly, in particular: 

            - its
Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually or in
association           with others, to
promote the protection and realization of human rights and   fundamental freedoms at the national and
international levels” ;
-

Article 6 (c) which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in

attention to those matters” ;
-         
and its
Article 12.2 which states that “the State shall take all necessary measures to
ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually
and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de
facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action
as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in
the present Declaration”.
