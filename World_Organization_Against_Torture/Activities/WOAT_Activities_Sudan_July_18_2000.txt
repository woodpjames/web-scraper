Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT has received information from The Sudanese Victims of Torture Group, a member of the OMCT network regarding the arrests and arbitrary detention of Hassan Ahmed Osman.   According to the information received, Hassan Osman was re-arrested on 17th July 2000 from his office in the centre of Khartoum by security forces.  Previously, on 10th July 2000, Hassan Osman was arrested, and his personal computer and printer confiscated by Security Forces.  He was then released on 13th July 2000, and asked to report to the Security Forces on Saturday 15th July 2000.  He was detained until midnight without explanation and he was neither interrogated nor charged.  Following his release, he was again asked to report to Security Forces on Sunday 16 July.  He had not reported as there were no charges against him.    According to the information received, Security Forces consider Mr. Osman as a communist activist.  His arrests are believed to be part of a new tactic by the security forces in Sudan against political opponents and human rights activists; to be summoned to security offices daily from early morning to midnight as a kind of part-time arrest.  Hassan Osman was previously arrested in February 1997 and subsequently released in December 1997 (see case SDN 240297).  Action requested  Please write to the Sudanese authorities urging them to:  i.	take all necessary measures to guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Hassan Osman and order his immediate release in the absence of valid legal charges or, if such charges exist, bring him before an impartial and competent tribunal and guarantee his procedural rights at all times; ii.	guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
