Release
/ Dismissal of charges
Bahrain
November 16, 2012
 
The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of
the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation
Against Torture (OMCT), has received new information and requests your urgent
intervention in the following situation in Bahrain.
 
New
information:
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about
the release and the dismissal of charges against Mr. Sayed Yousif AlMuhafdhah, Acting Vice President and Head of Documentation Unit of
the Bahrain Center for Human Rights (BCHR).
 
According to the information received, on November 14,
2012, the Public Prosecution decided to release Mr. Sayed Yousif AlMuhafdhah
and drop the charges of “participation in illegal protests” that had been
pending against him since November 2, 2012. Mr. AlMuhafdhah had been detained
arbitrarily since that day (see background information). 
 
The Observatory welcomes these new developments and thanks
all the persons, institutions and organisations who intervened in Mr. Sayed
Yousif AlMuhafdhah's favour. However, the Observatory recalls that two other
BCHR members remain in detention, Messrs. Nabeel Rajab,
BCHR President, Director of the Gulf Centre for Human Rights (GCHR) and FIDH
Deputy Secretary General, and Mr. Abdulhadi Al Khawaja, former BCHR President and former MENA Director at
Front Line, and urges the Bahraini authorities to release them
immediately and unconditionally, as their detention seems to merely aim at
sanctioning and hindering their human rights activities.
 
Background
information:
 
On November 2, 2012, Mr. AlMuhafdhah was arrested in Duraz
while he was documenting the injury of a man who was shot by bird-shot pellets
at a protest earlier that day. Mr. AlMuhafdhah was transferred to Budaiya
Police Station where he was interrogated about his presence at the injured
man's door. 
 
In the morning of November 3, 2012, Mr. AlMuhafdhah was
taken to the public prosecution where he was remanded seven days of detention
on charges of “participation in illegal protests”. Mr. Said denied having taken
part in the protest and stated that he arrived on the spot after the end of the
event in order to document the case of the injured protester.
 
On November 10, 2012, the public prosecution decided to
extend Mr. Sayed Yousif AlMuhafdhah's detention by seven additional days
without providing any grounds or justification for this decision. During the
session, Mr. Almuhafdhah denied participating in said protests.
 
Moreover, on September 23, 2012, Mr. AlMuhafdhah and other
Bahraini human rights defenders who cooperated with the United Nations (UN)
received threats of reprisals while they were in Geneva to participate in the
21st session of the UN Human Rights Council. The pro-governmental newspaper Al-Watan accused Mr. AlMuhafdhah and
other human rights defenders of “defaming Bahrain” and labelled them as
“traitors to the country”.

states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with

these and other appropriate means, to draw public attention to those matters” ;
-       
and its Article 12.2
which states that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the
protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in
association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto
or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a
consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the
