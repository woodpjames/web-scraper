Brief description of the situation: The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by a reliable source[1] about the arbitrary detentions of petitioners Mr. Du Yangming, Ms. Wang Shuizhen, Mr. Tian Baocheng and Ms. Zhang Cuiping. All four were reportedly detained and charged in connection with their activities around the time of the meeting of the intergovernmental Shanghai Cooperation Organisation in June 2006. Furthermore, OMCT has been informed that two Shanghai petitioners, Ms. Duan Chunfang and Mr. Duan Huimin, have been subjected to ill-treatment after being arrested in November 2006. According to the information received, Mr. Du Yangming, 60 years old, was detained on 2 June 2006, after police came to his home and took him away for questioning. Mr. Du Yangming has been reportedly petitioning the authorities for years over the demolition of his former home. He has previously spent 18 months in Reeducation through Labor (RTL), and has been put under criminal detention three times, during which he reportedly suffered serious physical abuse. According to the same information, Ms. Wang Shuizhen was detained on 5 June 2006 while on her way to accompany lawyer Zheng Enchong's wife, Jiang Meili, to Tilanqiao Prison to await Zheng's release upon completion of his three-year prison sentence on charges of revealing state secrets overseas. Ms. Wang Shuizhen was formally arrested in early July 2006. She previously served two years in prison for "causing a disturbance" when in April 2003 she refused to undergo ideological training as ordered by her local housing committee chairman. It is also reported that Mr. Tian Baocheng and his wife Zhang Cuiping were detained on 2 June 2006, after which Mr. Tian Baocheng was formally charged with "causing a disturbance" on 8 July 2006, and his wife Zhang was sentenced to 18 months of RTL. Both Mr. Tian Baocheng and Ms. Zhang Cuiping had previously served terms of RTL in 2003, and during his detention, Mr. Tian Baocheng was reportedly subjected to serious physical abuse that resulted in the loss of two teeth and multiple injuries to his head, chest, arms and legs. According to the same information, Mr. Du Yangming, Mr. Wang Shuizhen and Mr. Tian Baocheng were scheduled to appear in Shangai’s Zhabei District People court on 8 and 9 November 2006 on charges of “causing a disturbance”. Mr. Du Yangming, Ms. Wang Shuizhen and Mr. Tian Baocheng cannot afford a lawyer and are reportedly being defended by court-appointed counsel. However, family members reported that they have been unable to talk to or meet with the lawyers. Ms. Wang Shuizhen's husband reportedly requested a copy of the indictment against his wife from her lawyer after the court refused to provide it to him. The lawyer reportedly also refused to assist him, saying, "That's up to the government - don't bother me!" Furthermore, OMCT has been informed that two Shanghai petitioners, Ms. Duan Chunfang and Mr. Duan Huimin, have been subjected to ill-treatment after being arrested. Ms. Duan Chunfang and Mr. Duan Huimin, who are brother and sister, went to Beijing to petition the central authorities at the beginning of November 2006. Early on the morning of 3 November, a dozen plainclothes police officers reportedly burst into the guesthouse where they were staying and took them away. While in the police van, Ms. Duan Chunfang felt ill and asked to be allowed to sit near the window. Police officers reportedly responded by yanking her hair. According to the information, when Mr. Duan Huimin saw what was happening to his sister, he tried to move near her, only to be pulled from the vehicle and beaten by more than 10 police officers. Mr. Duan Huimin was then handcuffed and forced into the rear of the vehicle. Ms. Duan Chunfang and Mr. Duan Huimin were kept separate on the train back to Shanghai, and Ms. Duan Chunfang was unable to find her brother upon arrival. According to the same information, Mr. Duan Huimin was seen on the train with obvious injuries, and he has reportedly been placed under criminal detention on accusations of assaulting a security officer with a weapon. Mr. Duan's parents spent all day and night outside of the detention center trying to see him, until police finally forced them to return home. The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned for the physical and psychological integrity of the petitioners, especially of Mr. Du Yangming, Ms. Wang Shuizhen, Mr Tian Baocheng, Ms. Zhang Cuiping and Mr. Duan Huimin. In addition to calling for the release of the above mentioned persons in the absence of valid charges, OMCT also deplores the brutal treatment Mr. Duan Huimin and Ms. Duan Chunfang suffered. The International Secretariat of OMCT urges the Chinese authorities to conform with China’s international human rights obligations, commitments that were reaffirmed on the occasion of its election as a member of the new United Nations Human Rights Council. Action requested: Please write to the authorities in the People’s Republic of China urging them to:  Guarantee, in all circumstances, the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Du Yangming, Ms. Wang Shuizhen, Mr Tian Baocheng, Ms. Zhang Cuiping, Mr. Duan Huimin and Ms. Duan Chunfang; Order the immediate release of Mr. Du Yangming, Ms. Wang Shuizhen, Mr Tian Baocheng, Ms. Zhang Cuiping and Mr. Duan Huimin in the absence of valid charges that are consistent with international law and standards, or, if such charges exist, bring them before an impartial and competent tribunal and guarantee their procedural rights at all times; Order a thorough and impartial investigation into these events, particularly the acts of ill-treatment, in order to identify all those responsible, bring them to trial and apply the penal and/or administrative sanctions as provided by law; Guarantee that adequate compensation is awarded to all victims; Guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
