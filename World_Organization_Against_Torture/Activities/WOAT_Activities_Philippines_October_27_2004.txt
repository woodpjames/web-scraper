According to the information received, on October 13th 2004, an armed confrontation between New People’s Army (NPA) and the joint forces of SOLCOM, Air Force and 1st Infantry Battalion of the Armed Forces of the Philippines took place on the line separating the two provinces of Laguna and Quezon.  It is reported that on October 14th 2004, at about 10:00 in the morning, two gunshots were heard in this region and that two helicopters were seen roving around the area. On October 15th 2004, members of the Armed Forces displayed two dead bodies in the Plaza of Cavinte  in Laguna, claiming that they belonged to the NPA. The bodies wore boots and bonnets and the mark NPA was visible on their faces. Many gunshot wounds covered the bodies from hips to feet. Clemente Calantrava’s body was torn apart by the bullets.     According to the information, the victim’s families held that they were not NPA members and that on the day of the incident they went to Barangay Caldong to hunt for treasure.
