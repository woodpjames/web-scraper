0917 / OBS 105
Closure
attempt 
Egypt
September 27, 2017
 
The Observatory for the Protection
of Human Rights Defenders, a partnership of the World Organisation Against
Torture (OMCT) and the FIDH, requests your urgent intervention in the following
situation in Egypt. 
 
Description
of the situation:
 
The Observatory has been
informed by reliable sources about the attempt of closure by Egyptian authorities
of the
Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF)[1].

                       
According to the
information received, on September 20, 2017, a committee from the Investment
Authority, accompanied by National Security officers and a police van, entered ECRF’s
headquarters office in Cairo, claiming to hold a warrant to close down the
organisation and attempted to put a wax seal on the office’s door on grounds
that remain unknown. No warrant was effectively presented.
 
Lawyers present at the office
rejected these claims and prevented the closure arguing that it would be
illegal since ECRF is a law firm operating in accordance with national
legislation[2].
Nonetheless, the committee threatened to come again. 
 
In October 2016, another committee
from the Investment Authority had made a similar unannounced visit and searched
ECRF’s premises. 
 
This unannounced raid and closing
attempt occurs several days after the Egyptian government blocked ECRF’s
website on September 5, 2017, and one month after the publication of ECRF’s
report on enforced disappearances in Egypt. The report documented 378 cases of
enforced disappearances between August 2016 and August 2017, and labelled the
Egyptian security apparatuses as the main actor to be held accountable for
these grave human rights violations.
 
It is worth mentioning that ECRF is
legally supporting and advising Giulio Regeni’s family members in the
investigation of Giulio Regeni’s enforced disappearance followed by death in
2016[3]
and was due to receive them soon. 
 
Moreover, this closing attempt follows
the abduction and arbitrary detention of human rights defender Ibrahim Metwally Hegazy[4], Coordinator of the Association of the Families of
Victims of Enforced Disappearances in Egypt, an association that ECRF supports
with legal advice. Mr. Ibrahim Metwally Hegazy also reportedly provided legal
assistance to Giulio Regeni’s family.
 
The
Observatory recalls that this is not the first time ECRF is targeted by the
Egyptian authorities. Several members of ECRF have been arrested and subjected
to ill-treatment. Founder and executive director of ECRF
Mohamed Lotfy was arrested on June 2, 2015 and was put under a
travel ban for security reasons [5], co-founder
of ECRF Ahmed Abdullah was arrested on April 25, 2016 and released on bail on
September 10, 2016, and minority rights expert Mina Thabet
was arrested on May 19, and released on bail on June 18, 2016. 
 
The Observatory
expresses its utmost concerns over the attempt of closure of ECRF, as it
appeared to be linked with its legal work in Giulio Regeni’s case, and
consequently urges the Egyptian authorities to put an end to all acts of
harassment against ECRF and its members. 
 
This attempt
of closure is part of the crackdown of Egyptian authorities against civil
society in the country, imposing harsh restrictions on the right to peaceful
assembly and freedom of expression and repeatedly trying to shut down
several human rights organisations[6].  
 
Actions
requested:
 
Please write to the
authorities of Egypt asking them to:
 
      
i.        
Put an end to all acts of harassment, including at the
judicial level, against ECRF and its members, as well as against all human
rights defenders in Egypt;
 
     
ii.        
Refrain from further hindering the right to freedom of
association, peaceful assembly and expression in Egypt;
 
    
iii.        
Conform with the provisions of the UN
Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the
United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially Articles 1, 6(c) and 12.2; and
 
   
iv.        
More generally, ensure in all circumstances the
respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with international and regional human
rights instruments ratified by Egypt.
