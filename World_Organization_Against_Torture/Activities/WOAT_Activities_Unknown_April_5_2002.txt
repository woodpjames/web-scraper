New information  The International Secretariat of OMCT has received information from a reliable source that on March 26th, 2002, the body of Angie Milano (legal name: Andy Rafael Milano), a 28-year old transgender woman, was found in an advanced state of decomposition behind the commercial centre Sambil, Mañongo sector, city of Valencia, State of Carabobo.  According to the information received, Angie Milano was a member of the organization “Respeto a la Personalidad” dedicated to the defence of Human Rights of transgender persons.  The organisation has documented a pattern of police abuse against transgender persons in Carabobo including harassment, death threats, arrests and arbitrary detentions, torture and other cruel or inhuman treatment.  Furthermore, victims are also allegedly forced to engage in sexual relations with police officers under the threat of arrest, a frequent practice in this State.  According to the report, on March 26th, 2002, the Division de Inteligencia Policial of Carabobo, issued an order for the arrest of Maury Oviedo, President of the aforementioned organisation.  Once arrested she was to be handed immediately to the intelligence officials of the police.  Maury Oviedo, fearing police custody, decided to hide.  She had previously denounced locally, nationally, and internationally, the extrajudicial execution of two members of the organisation (Ms. Dayana Nieves and Michelle Paz, who were killed on July 2000, and January 2002 respectively – see case VEN 230102).  According to the information received, two members of “Respeto a la Personalidad”, Estrella de los Angeles Alvarez Vásquez and Paola Sánchez, together with Yoseline Martínez Rujano, have been detained since March 20th, 2002 in the prison Isabelica.  Dr. Ana Guerra, Assistant Defender of the People of the State of Carabobo, had declared that she was the prefect of the church of Santa Rosa, following orders of the state governor, who had captured the victims with the support of over 80 policemen when they were travelling within the city.  They were arbitrarily detained under the charge of “sexual prophylaxis”, without a warrant of a control Judge and without informing the Public Ministry.         According to the report, the victims were forcibly stripped of their clothes in a special closed room and were then mocked while beaten severely by the police.  They were then locked in a cell, where they currently remain.    According to the report the wave of violence goes back at least two years and has recently intensified, as it seems that in Carabobo a model of persecution has been established by the State Governor, Mr. Enrique Fernando Salas Feo-Romer, and his police agents.  This persecution and other serious Human Rights violations of transgender persons are tolerated and encouraged by the authorities.  An order has been reportedly been issued that calls to the eradication of transsexual practices in the State of Carabobo, including a list of crimes with their corresponding sentences that constitute clear and grave Human Rights violations of transgender persons.  According to the information received, police officers are involved in both crimes.  A report has been presented by the aforementioned organisation to Mr. Santiago Cantón, executive secretary of the Interamerican Commission of Human Rights, because none of these serious Human Rights violations were adequately investigated, and the perpetrators continue to enjoy impunity.  According to the report, the extrajudicial execution of Ms. Angie Milano is the second this year in the State of Carabobo, on January 11th, OMCT, registered the finding of the body of Ms. Michelle Paz, another transgender person, as well as acts of harassment, arbitrary arrests and detentions against numerous transgender persons in the city (see case VEN 230102).
