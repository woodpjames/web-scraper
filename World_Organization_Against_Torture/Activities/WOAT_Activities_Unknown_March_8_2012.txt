received little attention in the human rights arena, the Global Report on the Situation of WHRDs plays
a crucial part in advancing the recognition of WHRDs.
The Global Report gives a contextual analysis of the
environment in which WHRDs work and the violations they face because of their
gender and/or work defending gender-based rights. It is intended that the Global
Report is primarily an advocacy and capacity building tool, both
important measures for WHRDs’ protection and the prevention of further abuses.
It is a contribution to the ongoing documentation of the
situation of WHRDs that will enable informed advocacy from the local to
regional and international level. The Global Report is
a publication of the Women Human Rights Defenders International
Coalition (WHRD IC).
OMCT is a member of the Women Human Rights
Defenders International Coalition (WHRD IC), a resource and advocacy
network for the protection and support of women human rights defenders (WHRDs)
worldwide. WHRDs are women active in human rights defense who are targeted for
who they are as well as those active in the defense of women’s rights who are
targeted for what they do. This includes human rights activists who are women,
as well as other activists (whether male, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender
or intersex) who also defend the rights of women and sexual rights.
