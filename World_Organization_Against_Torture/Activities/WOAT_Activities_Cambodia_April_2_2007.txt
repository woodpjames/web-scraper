Brief description of the situation: The Observatory has been informed by the Cambodian Human Rights Action Committee (CHRAC) of the threat made by the Royal Government of Cambodia to expel the Open Society Justice Initiative (OSJI), a US-based international organisation, from the country or to revoke staff visas. The OSJI is actively engaged in the monitoring of the Khmers Rouge’s trials by the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC). According to the information received, they publicised last February allegations of financial embezzlement at the Khmers Rouge tribunal and called for a thorough investigation into these allegations. The expulsion of the OSJI from Cambodia would clearly contravene the principles guaranteed by the 2003 Agreement between the United Nations and the Royal Government of Cambodia concerning the prosecution under Cambodian law of crimes committed during the period of democratic Kampuchea, especially its Article 12 (2), which states that “in the interest of securing a fair and public haring and credibility of the procedure, it is understood that representatives of [...] national and international non-governmental organizations will at all times have access to the proceedings before the Extraordinary Chambers”. Such threats against human rights defenders are also in flagrant violation of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, which states in its article 9.3 (b) that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, inter alia [...] to attend public hearings, proceedings and trials so as to form an opinion on their compliance with national law and applicable international obligations and commitments”. The ouster of this organisation, in response to its monitoring activities, could be detrimental to the procedure and could lead to the lack of credibility of the Court. The Observatory is deeply concerned about these threats which also reveal the poor state of freedom of expression in this country. Action requested: Please write to the Cambodian authorities and ask them to:  Put an immediate end to these threats of expelling and allow the OSJI’s representatives to carry out their monitoring work without hindrance; Put an end to all acts of harassment against all human rights defenders in Cambodia; Conform with the provisions of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 9, 1998, in particular its article 1 which provides that “every person has the right, individually or collectively, to promote the protection and fulfilment of human rights and fundamental liberties at the national and international levels”, as well as its article 8.2, which states that everyone has the right, “individually and in association with others, to submit to governmental bodies and agencies and organisations concerned with public affairs criticism and proposals for improving their functioning and to draw attention to any aspect of their work that may hinder or impede the promotion, protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms”, and its above mentioned article 9.3 (b); Promote and ensure freedom of expression in Cambodia with respect to the ECCC and more generally ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by Cambodia.
