Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Palestinian Society for the Protection of Human Rights and the Environment (LAW), a member of the OMCT network, that on 21st May 2000, Sado Mudhi Al Hawarin, 15 years old, from Al Thahriyi, Hebron, died from injuries he sustained during clashes on 15th May 2000 at the northern entrance to Al Bireh.  Al Hawarin is the sixth victim (see cases ISR 160500 and ISR 160500.1 for other victims) since the start of demonstrations by Palestinians to commemorate the 1948 Nakba day and peaceful marches in solidarity with Palestinian prisoners who have been on a hunger strike for the last few weeks.    The International Secretariat of OMCT reiterates LAW’s concerns that despite the loss of life, the Israeli occupation forces continue to use excessive force against unarmed Palestinian citizens.  Furthermore, that the Israeli occupation forces are using live ammunition and that most injuries sustained by Palestinians are in the chest, abdomen and neck areas.  OMCT strongly condemns the excessive use of force by Israeli forces at peaceful demonstrations held by Palestinians.  Action requested  Please write to the authorities in Israel urging them to:  i.	guarantee an immediate investigation into the death of Sado Mudhi Al Hawarin, identify those responsible, bring them before a civil competent and impartial tribunal and apply the penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions provided by law; ii.	guarantee adequate compensation to the family of Al Hawarin; iii.	put an end to the use of unnecessary excessive force including the use of live ammunition by the Israeli armed forces; iv.	guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
