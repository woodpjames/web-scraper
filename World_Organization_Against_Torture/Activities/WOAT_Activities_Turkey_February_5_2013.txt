The Observatory for the
Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the International
Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation Against Torture
(OMCT), has received new information and requests your urgent intervention in
the following situation in Turkey.
 
New information:
 
The Observatory has been
informed by the Human Rights Association (İnsan Haklari Derneği - İHD)
of the sentencing of four lawyers members of İHD Ankara Branch, Ms. Filiz
Kalaycı, former Chairperson, as well as Messrs. Hasan Anlar, General Executive Board member, Halil
İbrahim Vargün, Chairperson and Murat
Vargün. 
 
According to the
information received, on January 25, 2013, Ankara Heavy Penal Court No. 11
sentenced Ms. Filiz Kalaycı to seven years and six months of imprisonment as
well as Mr. Hasan Anlar, Mr. Halil İbrahgim Vargün and Mr. Murat Vargün to six
years and three months each on charges of
“membership to an illegal organisation” under Article
314 of the Turkish Penal Code (TPC)
due to their human rights activities. As their lawyers filed an appeal against
the sentence, no arrest warrant was issued against the four lawyers.
 
The Observatory is deeply concerned by the sentencing
of Ms. Filiz Kalaycı and Messrs.
Hasan Anlar, Halil İbrahgim Vargün and Murat Vargün, which seems to merely aim at sanctioning their human rights activities,
and calls upon the Turkish authorities to review it. 
 
It further recalls
that dozens of human rights defenders are currently subjected to prolonged
judicial harassment for abusive terrorism charges in Turkey. In this context,
İHD has particularly been the subject of a systematic campaign of judicial
harassment, as a direct result of its human rights work in Turkey, in
particular on Kurdish issues. 
 
Background information:
 
On May 12, 2009, in Ankara,
the offices and homes of Ms. Filiz Kalaycı, Messrs. Hasan Anlar, Halil İbrahim Vargün and Murat
Vargün were raided by officers of the Anti-Terror Unit of the police, who were
in possession of a search warrant and a detention order against them. They were
immediately arrested, placed in police custody in the Anti-Terror Forces Unit
detention centre, and released in the night of May 14, 2009. The Public
Prosecutor brought Ms. Filiz Kalaycı, Messrs. Hasan Anlar,
Halil Ibrahim Vargun and Murat Vargun before Ankara Heavy Penal Court No. 11 and
requested that they be remanded in detention. However, the court decided to
release Ms. Filiz Kalaycı, Messrs. Hasan Anlar, Halil Ibrahim Vargun and
Murat Vargun, but imposed a travel ban on them, on the basis of Article 109 of
the Code of Criminal Procedure.
 
The
Public Prosecutor appealed the decision, and issued a warrant of arrest against
Ms. Filiz Kalaycı on May 25,
2009. On May 28,
2009, Ms. Filiz Kalaycı was re-arrested on the basis of an allegation of
“aiding illegal organisations”. Messrs. Hasan Anlar, Halil İbrahim Vargün and
Murat Vargün were also subject to the same allegations but not arrested.
 
These acts of
harassment intervened after the publication by İHD of a report on human rights
violations in prisons of Turkey on February 6, 2009 and made it public to draw
attention on these violations. İHD had shared this report with the authorities.
In addition, Ms. Filiz Kalaycı, Messrs. Hasan Anlar, Halil İbrahim Vargün and
Murat Vargün had been working on cases of human rights violations that occurred
in detention, and as a consequence they often received letters of complaint
from prison inmates. The charges are notably related to contacts entertained by
the lawyers with their clients.
 
Their first hearing
was held on November 9, 2009 before Ankara Heavy Penal Court No. 11. Although
the defence lawyers claimed that the accusation of the Prosecutor against İHD
lawyers and members was unfair and the evidence was both illegal and
insufficient, the court rejected the petition. On January 28, 2010, Ms. Filiz
Kalaycı as well as Messrs. Hasan Anlar, Halil İbrahim Vargün and Murat Vargün,
appeared before Ankara Heavy Penal Court No. 11, which ordered Ms. Filiz
Kalaycı’s release. The trial was postponed several times until it resumed on
October 6, 2011.
 
Actions required:
 
Please write to the Turkish
authorities, urging them to:
 
i. Guarantee in all
circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Ms. Filiz Kalaycı, Mr.
Hasan Anlar, Mr. Halil İbrahgim Vargün, Mr. Murat Vargün as well as all
human rights defenders in Turkey;
 
ii. Put an end to all acts
harassment, including at the judicial level, against Ms. Filiz Kalaycı, Mr. Hasan
Anlar, Mr. Halil İbrahgim Vargün, Mr. Murat Vargün, as well as against all
human rights defenders in Turkey;
 
iii. Comply with the
provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, especially its
Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in
association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and
realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and
international levels”, as well as Article 12.2, which provides that “the State
shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities
of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence,
threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or
any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise
of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”;
 
iv. More generally, ensure
in all circumstances the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in
accordance with international and regional human rights instruments ratified by
Turkey.
