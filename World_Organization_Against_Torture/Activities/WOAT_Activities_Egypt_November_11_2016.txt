URGENT APPEAL - THE
OBSERVATORY

New informationEGY 002 / 0516 / OBS 042.1Judicial harassment / Restrictions to freedom of associationEgyptNovember 11, 2016 
The Observatory for the Protection of
Human Rights Defenders, a partnership of the World Organisation Against Torture
(OMCT) and the FIDH, has received new information and requests your urgent
intervention in the following situation in Egypt.
 
New information:
 
The Observatory has been informed by
reliable sources about the continuing judicial harassment against Judge Hesham Raouf, from Cairo’s Appeal Court
and former Justice Minister’s assistant,
Mr. Negad El-Borai, human rights
lawyer and Director of the “United Group – Attorneys-at-law, Legal Advisors”
(United Group)[1], and
Judge Assem Abdel Gabar, who are all
under investigation for participating in the drafting of the Anti-Torture Bill.
 
According to the
information received, Judge Abdulshafy Othman officially summoned Judge Hesham
Raouf to an investigation session on November 12, 2016, to discuss the charges
retained against him for his participation in the drafting of the Anti-Torture
Bill that United Group submitted to the President for promulgation (see background
information).
 
The Observatory strongly condemns the ongoing judicial
harassment against Judge Hesham Raouf,
along with Mr. Negal El-Borei and Judge Assem Abdel Gabar, for drafting
an anti-torture bill, which is particularly striking since the Egyptian
Government had committed in March 2015 before the 28th session of
the United Nations Human Rights Council to carry out legislative amendments to
help combat the crime of torture effectively. 
 
It has to be noted that the criminalisation of
anti-torture work comes at a time of rising government pressure on human rights
defenders and organisations in Egypt[2],
in the context of a dramatic deterioration of the human rights situation in the
country, marked namely by a serious crackdown on civil society and a notable
increase in cases of torture, deaths in detention and enforced disappearances.
 
In the light of this worrying situation, the
Observatory warns about the ever shrinking space for anti-torture
organisations and defenders whose work in Egypt is of vital importance, and
calls upon the Egyptian authorities to put an end to any form of harassment to
the work of civil society fighting torture and promoting human rights in the
country. 
 
Background Information:
 
On May 17, 2016, at 3 pm, Mr. Negad El-Borai was
summoned for a fifth investigation audience[3]
following the complaint filed by the High Judicial Council against him for
drafting an anti-torture bill in March 2015, organising a workshop to discuss
it, and advocating before the Egyptian authorities for its adoption in April
2015[4].

 
Previously Mr. El-Borai attended four investigation sessions
for this same case, the last one on March 3, 2016, when he was arrested and
subsequently released from custody on his guarantee of residence, and charged
with “establishing an unlicensed entity for the intent of inciting resistance
to the authorities”, “implementing human rights activities without a license”,
“deliberately spreading false information with the purpose of harming public
order or public interest” and “receiving
funds from the National Center for State Courts (NCSC)”. 
 
On June 5, 2016, Mr. El-Borai was again called for an
investigation session, during which the Investigating Judge confronted him
with the National Security officer’s depositions. The officer stated in a
memorandum that Mr. El-Borai “received
funds from foreign organisations to bring down the State and attract youth to
establish political movements in order to turn public opinion against the State
using methods of “non-violence”. He added that Mr. El-Borai “gives statements to the media that turn
public opinion against the State inside and outside the country using the
indirect methods of the “minds revolution” that causes its fall.
 
Actions requested:
 
Please write to the authorities of Egypt
asking them to:
 
i. Put an end to all forms of harassment -
including at the judicial level - against Judge Hesham Raouf, Negad El-Borai, the United Group, and in
general against anti-torture organisations and all human rights defenders in
Egypt;
 
ii. Drop all charges against Judge Hesham Raouf and Negad El-Borai,
as they only aim at sanctioning their legitimate human rights activities;
 
iii. Comply with all the provisions of the
United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, in particular with its
Articles 1, 5(b) and 12.2;
 
iv. Ensure in all circumstances respect
for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international
human rights standards and international instruments ratified by Egypt.

pretext that they received unauthorised foreign funding, as well as individual
human rights defenders, by prosecuting and criminalising them, see the
Observatory Joint Press Release of March 23, 2016. See
also the joint statement released by three UN
