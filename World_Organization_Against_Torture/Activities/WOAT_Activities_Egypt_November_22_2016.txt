The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a
partnership of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and FIDH, requests
your urgent intervention in the following situation in Egypt. 

Description of the situation:

The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the travel ban and
assets freeze imposed against Ms. Azza Soliman, human rights lawyer
and founder of the Centre for Egyptian Women Legal Aid (CEWLA), and member of
the Executive Committee of the WHRD MENA Coalition.

According to the information received, on November 17, 2016 Azza Soliman intended
to travel from Egypt to Jordan in order to participate in a training for the
Mushawah movement, an organisation promoting equity within the Muslim
community, when she was informed by the authorities that she was banned from
travelling. This followed a judicial order instructed that same day by the
investigative judge in the case No. 173/2011,
commonly known as “NGOs foreign funding case”, which also ordered the freezing
of her personal as well as her law firm’s assets. 
Ms.
Soliman was never informed of any charges against her or summoned for
interrogation. She is the third high-profile human rights defender and NGO
Director to be banned from travelling this month, a few days after human rights
lawyers Ahmad Ragheb founder of the National Community for Human Rights
and Law (NCHRL) and Malek Adly director of the Lawyers Network of the
Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR)[1].

The
Observatory would like to recall that both the imposition of travel bans and of
assets freezes against human rights defenders and organisations is a common
pattern of harassment increasingly used by the Egyptian authorities against
human rights defenders in the country[2].

The
Observatory is extremely concerned about this new act of harassment against Ms.
Azza Soliman, which only aims at sanctioning her legitimate human rights
activities, and urges the Egyptian authorities to immediately and
unconditionally put an end to all restriction against her freedom of movement
and association, and more in general to protect all human rights defenders in
Egypt.

Background information:
On
January 24, 2015, Ms. Soliman voluntary went to the Public Prosecution's office
to give her testimony regarding the violent dispersal by security forces of a
protest organised on the same day by the political party “Popular Alliance”,
which led to the death of political activist Ms. Shaimaa El Sabbagh. Ms.
Soliman did not take part in the protest, but was coincidentally in the same
area and witnessed the dispersal and the shooting of the activist.

After waiting several hours at the Public Prosecution's office, Ms. Soliman was
finally able to give her testimony, pointing to the responsibility of the
police for the death of the activist. Ms. Soliman also filed a complaint
accusing the Minister of Interior and security forces of having violently
dispersed the peaceful protest.

Upon completion of her testimony, the prosecutor then interrogated her, and
informed her that he was going to press charges against her and four other
witnesses for “illegal gathering” and “participating in a protest that harmed
public security”. Ms. Soliman was released along with the other four, pending
investigation.

On March 23, 2015, Ms. Soliman was formally charged with “unauthorised
protest”, and “breach of security and public order”. Along with Ms. Soliman,
sixteen others were charged, including Ms. Nagwa Abbass, member of the
Socialist Popular Alliance Party.

On March 28, 2015, the lawyers of Ms. Soliman requested from the General
Prosecutor to include her as a witness and not as a defendant in the case,
however on March 31, this request was denied.

On April 4, 2015, the first hearing took place before the Abdeen Misdemeanor
Court. Ms. Soliman's lawyers requested adjournment, as they had not been able
to access the criminal files[3].
The request was granted and the Court adjourned the hearing to May 9, 2015. On
May 9, the judge heard requests made by lawyers of other accused and adjourned
the hearing to May 23, 2015.

On May 23, 2015, the Abdeen Misdemanour Court acquitted Ms. Soliman on charges
of “unauthorised protest” and “breach of security and public order”. However, on May 26, 2015, the Public Prosecution
appealed the decision. The first court hearing was due to be held on September
26, but was then postponed to October 24, 2015.

Meanwhile, on June 11, 2015, one police officer was sentenced to 15 years
imprisonment on charges of “beating leading to death” of Ms. Shaimaa Al
Sabbagh.
On
October 24, 2015, the Qasr Al Nil Appeal Court confirmed the acquittal of Ms.
Azza Soliman along with sixteen other defendants on charges of “unauthorised
protesting” and “breach of security and public order”. This decision is final
and not subject to appeal.
