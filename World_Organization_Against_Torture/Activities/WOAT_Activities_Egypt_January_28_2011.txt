 EGYPT: Violent repression of
peaceful demonstrationsGeneva,
28 January
 2011. The World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) condemns the excessive
use of force and violence against the protests that have started on 25 January
2011 in different governorates to denounce poverty, corruption and police
brutality, which led to the death of at least seven protesters and one policeman,
leaving hundreds injured and about one thousand protesters arrested[1].
According to the information received, security
forces used rubber bullets and tear gas to disperse the largely
peaceful demonstrations and batons,
clubs and sticks to beat the protestors. OMCT is also gravely concerned about
the safety of those arrested and recalls to the competent authorities of Egypt
that they are legally bound to effectively ensure the physical and
psychological integrity of all persons deprived of liberty in accordance with
international and regional human rights law, and in particular the UN
Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
Punishment, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the
African Charter on Human and People’s Rights to which Egypt is a State party.
OMCT is also
concerned about the blocking of social networks and several Egyptian media
websites, which are used by activists, journalists and bloggers, including
human rights defenders, to exchange information and provide information on the
demonstrations[2]. The Egyptian authorities
have for years used the emergency powers to severely curtail freedom of
assembly and to crackdown on peaceful opposition protests.
OMCT calls on the Egyptian authorities to
Immediately put an end to the continued
     repression of the peaceful protests and issue clear instructions to the
     security forces to refrain from using excessive force against the
     protestors in accordance with international
     standards, including the
     Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms and the Code of Conduct
     for Law Enforcement Officials;
Guarantee freedom of peaceful assembly and
     freedom of expression; 
Immediately release all those who were detained while
     peacefully demonstrating and immediately cease torture and ill-treatment; 
Carry out prompt, effective,
     thorough, independent and impartial investigations into the police abuses and violence, the
     results of which must be made public, in order to bring
     those responsible before a competent, independent and impartial tribunal
     and to apply penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions as provided by
     law; and provide
     the victims with
     adequate compensation, reparation and rehabilitation;
Establish, in close cooperation with the people directly concerned
     and their representatives, programmes for social, economic and cultural
     development that effectively respond to the needs of the people of Egpyt ; 


Ensure
     the respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms throughout the
     country in accordance with national laws and international human rights
     standards.
