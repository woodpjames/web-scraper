Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Asian Human Rights  Commission HK, a member of the OMCT network, of the brutal torture of a 17-year-old by several police officers from Ankumbura Police Station and Gramma Arraksaka, Sri Lanka.  According to the information received, the Gramma Arraksaka came to the house of the victim, B.G. Chamila Bandara Jayaratne on 20 July 2003 at around 4.30pm and took him away in order to extract a confession to recent alleged thefts.  Sergeant Pathnesiri reportedly struck the victim several blows to the face and the body. The victim saw his cousin, Upali, and a 14 year old boy Bandula Pathmakumara at this place. Two of the officers were in uniform. One policeman threatened to kill Upali if the victim did not confess. Then they were allegedly taken to the Ankumbura police station at about 6pm. The Inspector of Police Senevirathna hit the victim and kicked him in the face.  The victim was released but the next day (21 July)he was taken away again to a room. There were several officers present and the officer in charge and another officer hit the victim on the soles of his feet with a cricket stump, cane and pole. When he refused to confess he was hit further.  A polythene bag which had contained petrol was tied to his face. They reportedly threatened to burn and kill him. Then they put the victim's hands behind his back, tied his thumbs together and strung the victim up by his thumbs from a beam on the ceiling and continued beating.   Because of the extreme pain the victim informed who his friends were, confessed to the thefts and was made to state falsely to whom he had given the stolen items.  On 27 July, Upali, Saman, Salier, Bandula, and the victim were made to sign blank pages. Police officers obtained papers from a doctor at Ankumbura hospital but the victims were not allowed access to a doctor.   Then Salier and Upali were reportedly detained at Bogumbara prison hospital. The others were remanded in the prisons at Rajayagahavithiya. Later the victim learned that while he was in prison, his mother came, but she had not been allowed to see him.   On 30 July the victim was granted bail on ten thousand rupees surety. The next day, he recieved treatment in a hospital in Kandy for six days. The doctors told him that a nerve in his left hand had been stretched. His legs were swollen, his hands were numb, and he had headaches. A complaint was made to the hospital police. They asked the victim to go and make a complaint at the Ankumbura police station.   The International Secretariat of OMCT strongly condemns the Ankumbura police officers’ acts of torture perpetrated against B.G. Chamila Bandara Jayaratne . OMCT wishes to recall that Sri Lanka, as a State party to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, is bound to the provision that "No child shall be subjected to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment" (Art. 37 (a)). Furthermore, the Convention states that  "Every child deprived of liberty shall be treated with humanity and respect for the inherent dignity of the human person, and in a manner which takes into account the needs of persons of his or her age." (Art. 37 (c)).  The Convention further states that  " States Parties shall, in particular, ensure that every child alleged as or accused of having infringed the penal law has at least the following guarantees: (i)   To be presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law; (...) (iii)   To have the matter determined without delay by a competent, independent and impartial authority or judicial body in a fair hearing according to law, in the presence of legal or other appropriate assistance and, unless it is considered not to be in the best interest of the child, in particular, taking into account his or her age or situation, his or her parents or legal guardians; (iv)   Not to be compelled to give testimony or to confess guilt;" (Art. 40 para. 2 (b))  OMCT is deeply concerned by the lack of due diligence of Sri Lankan political authorities despite their awareness of a recent wave of allegations of police abuse and torture.  This is particularly disturbing in light of the fact that, under Sri Lankan law, torture is a crime punishable by a mandatory minimum sentence of seven years in prison.  As a result of the torture, AHRC reports that the victim cannot use his left arm. The police have reportedly falsely implicated him in the thefts. The date of the next hearing is 20 August 2003.
