The Observatory for the Protection of Human
Rights Defenders, a partnership of FIDH and the World Organisation Against Torture
(OMCT), has received new information and requests your urgent intervention in
the following situation in Belarus.
 
New
information:
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable
sources about the sentencing of Ms. Alena
Masliukova, member of Human Rights Centre “Viasna” in Svetlogorsk and Mr. Anatoly
Zmitrovich, an environmental activist. 
 
According to the information received, on
October 8 and 9, 2018, Mr. Anatoly Zmitrovich and Ms. Alena Masliukova were
respectively convicted by the Svetlogorsk District Court for the organisation
of the “Svetlogorsk - For Clean Air” flash-mob that took place on September 15,
2018, to protest against the damages caused by a bleached-pulp factory (see
background information below). Both of them were sentenced to a fine of 612,5
BYR (around 250 Euros), equivalent to two-thirds of the average monthly salary
in Belarus. They plan to appeal that decision. 
 
The Observatory recalls that the Belarusian
legislation violates the right to peaceful assembly by prohibiting citizens to
hold peaceful assemblies without authorisation. In Belarus, the authorities
routinely reject requests to hold peaceful assemblies related to most societal
issues, either without providing adequate reason or by imposing excessive
burdens on the organisers, such as requesting organisers to ensure first
medical aid during the event and to clean the venue after the protest. 
 
The Observatory strongly condemns the
sentencing of Ms. Alena Masliukova and Mr. Anatoly Zmitrovich which seems to be
only aimed at sanctioning their peaceful human rights activities and calls on
the authorities to quash this decision and drop all charges
against them. 
 
Background information: 
 
On September 24, 2018, Ms. Alena Masliukova and
Mr. Anatoly Zmitrovich appeared before the Svetlogorsk District Court on
charges of “taking part in an unauthorised mass event” (Part 1 of Article 23.34
of the Code of Administrative Offences). They faced up to 15 days of
administrative detention. 
 
The charges relate to a flash-mob which took place
on September 15, 2018 on a public square in Svetlogorsk to protest against the
environmental damage caused by a bleached-pulp factory. The flash-mob gathered
at least 150 people, many of them held green balloons and wore medical masks as
symbols of clean air. During the event, police officials warned the protesters
that the event was unauthorized and subject to sanctions under Article 23.34 of
the Code of Administrative Offenses.  
 
On September 14, 2018, Ms. Alena Masliukova was
summoned by the District Prosecutor A. Evseenko who threatened her of
prosecution in case of violation of the legislation on mass events, alleging
that she was involved in the organization of a mass protest of the following
day. Ms. Alena Masliukova denied every involvement in the organisation of the
event. 
 
On
September 15, 2018, Mr. Anatoly Zmitrovich filed a request before the District
Executive Committee of Svetlogorsk in order to organise a protest against the
factory. The request was denied, arguing that another event had already been
planned for that same day. Therefore, a group of activists decided to hold a
flash-mob instead.
 
Five days after the flash-mob, on September 20,
2018, Ms. Alena Masliukova and Mr. Anatoly Zmitrovich were summoned to the
Svetlogorsk District Police Department, where police officer Dmitri Shpak
charged them under Part 1 of Article 23.34. The two claimed that they had not
participated in any unauthorised mass event. None of the other flash-mob
participants are known to have been summoned. Ms. Alena Masliukova claims she
observed the event in her capacity as human rights defender while Mr. Anatoly
Zmitrovich links his prosecution with the fact that it was him who submitted
the application for authorisation to organise the protest that was subsequently
denied.
 
Actions requested:

Masliukova and Mr. Anatoly Zmitrovich, and put an end to any form of

to respect the exercise of the citizens' right to freedom of association and

Rights, in particular its Articles 21 and 22;

Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders adopted by the UN General
