Brief description of the situation:  The Observatory is gravely concerned at the persistence of attacks, threats and other forms of harassment against human rights defenders in Mexico, and particularly for the life and safety of Mr Plácido Camargo Ruíz, professor of primary education and an activist, member of the X section of the Sindicato Nacional de Trabajadores de la Educación (SNTE), and Ms Eufracia Altamirano Hernández, a well-known activist, member of the Asociación de Familiares de Detenidos Desaparecidos y Víctimas de Violaciones a los Derechos Humanos en México.(AFADEM).  The Observatory has been informed of the forced disappearance of Mr Plácido Camargo Ruíz, since the 16th of June 2000 in Mexico D.F. and according to the AFADEM and section IX of SNTE (Mexico D.F.) this occurred when Mr Camargo Ruíz was going to work. Up to now his whereabouts remain unknown in spite of an intense search in hospitals and prisons by friends and family members who moreover lodged a complaint on June 19th at the Centre for Support of Displaced or Absent Persons – CAPEA - of the General Justice Department of the Federal Department of Justice (the complaint was registered under the number: report 191).  Section IX of SNTE considers that the disappearance of Mr Camargo Ruíz could be attributable to a paramilitary group or agents of the Federal Judicial Police, as a reprisal for their activities during the teachers' strike between May and June 2000.They also maintain that other teachers, including Victor Pineda Enestrosa, Gregorio Alfonso Alvarado López and Modesto Patolzin M, have been detained as "disappeared" for political reasons without the authorities having revealed their whereabouts.   The Observatory has also been informed concerning the threats and harassment against Eufracia Altamirano Hernández, a member of the AFADEM branch in Atoyac de Alvarez, state of Guerrero. According to AFADEM the situation, which includes an unexplainable fire, on July 1st of part of her home, is motivated by her activities on behalf of human rights in the region of Tierra Caliente, Guerrero. These activities consisted especially of a struggle against impunity for violation of human rights, particularly forced disappearance, and the disclosing and teaching of human rights.  Action requested:  Write to the Mexican authorities urging them to:  i.	adopt urgent and effective measures in order to determine the whereabouts of Mr Plácido Camargo Ruíz, guarantee his personal safety in all circumstances and order his immediate release or bring him before a competent, ordinary tribunal which will examine the case against him, if such a case exists, in accordance with the rules and guarantees of due process;  ii.	take appropriate measures of protection in favour of Ms Eufracia Altamirano Hernández and guarantee her personal freedom, as well as her right to free exercise of her activities in favour of human rights;  iii.	carry out an immediate, thorough and impartial investigation into the facts mentioned above in order to clarify them, to determine those materially and intellectually responsible and impose upon them the sanctions provided by law;  iv.	ensure the implementation of the provisions of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders adopted by the General Assembly of the UN on December 9th 1998, in particular with reference to the right of every person "individually or in association with others to promote and to strive for the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels."
