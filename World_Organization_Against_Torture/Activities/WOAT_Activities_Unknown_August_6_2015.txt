The Observatory for the Protection of Human
Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the World Organisation Against Torture
(OMCT) and the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) requests your urgent intervention in the following
situation in The Philippines / United States of America.
Description of the situation:
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the restrictions on the
freedom of movement and harassment against Ms. Liza Largoza Maza, Chairperson of the International Women’s
Alliance and former representative of Gabriela Women’s Party.
According to the information received, on
July 9, 2015, at 11.15 a.m., Ms. Maza was barred from travelling to the US from
Manila's Ninoy Aquino International Airport. Ms. Maza had been invited to the
International People’s Tribunal to give an expert testimony on how two recent
bilateral security agreements between the US and the Philippines would violate
the sovereignty of the Philippines as well as the Filipino population’s rights.
As she was
about to board the plane, Ms. Laza was refused access. The airline ground staff
told her that it was due to an email from the Customs and Border Protection of
the US Department of Homeland Security. When she asked for a printed copy of
the email, the airline ground supervisor refused, saying that it could not be
disseminated to third parties.
Ms. Laza
went to the Philippine Bureau of Immigration to ask for an explanation and was
told that, as far as they were concerned, her travel papers were in order and
she was allowed to travel. She was then told to take her documents to the US
Embassy for evaluation. Ms. Maza has a valid 10-year US visa and has travelled
regularly to the US.
The
Observatory strongly condemns the restrictions on Ms. Liza Largoza Maza’s
freedom of movement and fears that she may be targeted because of her
legitimate human rights activities.
The
Observatory urges the US and the Philippine authorities to open an
investigation into the above-mentioned events and to refrain from further
restricting Ms. Maza’s right to freedom of movement.
Action requested:
Please write to the authorities in the US and the Philippines, urging
them to:
Conduct a proper, impartial, and independent investigation into the
above-mentioned events in order to determine whether Ms. Maza was barred
from travelling due to her legitimate human rights activities;
Put an end to all
forms of harassment, including restrictions on freedom of movement,
against Ms. Liza Largoza Maza and all human rights defenders in the
Philippines;
Comply with all the provisions
of the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by
the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially
regarding the following Articles:
-       
Article 1: “everyone has
the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to
strive for the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental
freedoms at the national and international levels”;
-       
Article 5(a): “For the
purpose of promoting and protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms,
everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, at the
national and international levels (...) To meet or assemble peacefully”
-       
Article 12.1:“everyone
has the right, individually and in association with others, to participate in
peaceful activities against violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms”;
-       
Article 12.2: “the State
shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent
authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against
any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse
discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his
or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present
Declaration;
Ensure in all
circumstances the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in
accordance with international human rights standards and international
instruments ratified by the Philippines.
