the Association for the Prevention of Torture (APT), the
International Federation of ACAT (FIACAT), the International

THE
FIGHT AGAINST TORTURE - AN AGENDA FOR CHANGE
TUESDAY
8 MARCH 2011, 15.00-16.30 • ROOM XXIV, PALAIS DES NATIONS


The
	event will provide an opportunity for the former and new Special
	Rapporteurs on torture to discuss some of the key challenges to the
	implementation of the mandate seen from a thematic and
	methodological perspective. During the event the incoming mandate
	holder, Prof Juan Mendez, will elaborate and discuss the key
	thematic issues that he plans to focus on and the methodology he
	intends to apply in his work with all stakeholders. This discussion
	will be informed by reflections from the former mandate holder, Prof
	Manfred Nowak, on some of the main challenges he experienced during
	the implementation of his mandate from a thematic and methodological
	point of view. The event will take a interactive format with
	presentations from the two panellists and interventions from the
	floor in two clusters focusing on thematic and methodological
	approaches.
