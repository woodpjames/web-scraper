Belarus

The Observatory for the Protection of
Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the International Federation for
Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), requests
your intervention in the following situation in Belarus.
Description of the situation:
The Observatory has been informed by
reliable sources of the arrest and alleged detention of Mr. Aleh Volchek,
Head of “Legal Aid to the Population”, an organisation that provided legal
assistance and was liquidated in 2003. The organisation recently published a
report about the trial of Mr. Ales Bialiatski, President of HRC Viasna
and FIDH Vice-President. Mr. Volchek's recent work focused not only on
political prisoners.
According to the information received, on
January 27, 2012, at around 3:35 pm, Mr. Aleh Volchek was arrested by the
police in the street in Minsk, not far from the boulevard Shevchenko, in
relation to charges of “petty hooliganism” under Article 17.1 of the
Administrative Code. The exact reasons of his detention are not known. 
As of issuing this Urgent Appeal, Mr. Aleh
Volchek remained detained in Maskouski District Police Department of Minsk. He
is due to appear before the Central District Court of Minsk on January 30,
2012.
The Observatory expresses its deepest
concern about the arrest of Mr. Aleh Volchek and calls for his immediate and
unconditional release since it seems to merely aim at sanctioning his human
rights activities.
Actions requested:
The Observatory urges the authorities of
Belarus to:
i.                    
Guarantee in all circumstances the
physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Aleh Volchek, as well as of all
human rights defenders in Belarus;ii.                  
Release Mr. Aleh Volchek immediately
and unconditionally since his detention is arbitrary;
iii.         Put an end to all forms of
harassment against him, including at the judicial level, and more generally
against all human rights defenders in the country; 
iv.                
Comply with all the provisions
of the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, in particular
with:
- its Article 1, which provides that
“everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to
promote and to strive for the protection and realization of human rights and
fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”,
- its Article 12.2, which states that “the
State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the
competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others,
against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse
discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his
or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present
Declaration”;
v.                  
More generally, ensure in all
circumstances the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in
accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with
international and regional human rights instruments ratified by Belarus.
