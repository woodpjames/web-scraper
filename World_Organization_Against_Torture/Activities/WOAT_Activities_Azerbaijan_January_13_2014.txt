The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of
the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation
Against Torture (OMCT), has received new information and requests your urgent
intervention in the following situation in Azerbaijan.
 
New information:
 
The
Observatory has been informed by the Human Rights Centre of Azerbaijan (HRCA)
that Mr. Ilham Amiraslanov, a human rights defender and member of the “Kur” Civil Society
Headquarter[1],
has been released on parole from prison.
 
According
to the information received, on December 9, 2013, Mr. Amiraslanov was
released from prison after
having served two-thirds of his two-year sentence passed on September 12, 2012
by the Sabirabad District Court (See background information).
 
The Observatory welcomes the early release of
Mr. Amiraslanov and calls on the Azerbaijani
authorities to put a stop to all forms of harassment, including at the judicial
level, against all human rights defenders in the country. In particular, the
Observatory recalls that Mr. Hilal Mammadov,
a minority rights defender and Editor-in-chief of the Tolishi-Sado (Voice
of Talysh) newspaper, has remained detained since June 21, 2012 and was
sentenced to five years in prison on September 27, 2013[2].
The Observatory also recalls that Mr. Anar
Mammadli, Chairman of the Azerbaijani Election Monitoring
and Democracy Studies Centre (EMDS), remains in remand
prison, pending investigation[3].
 
Background information[4]:
 
On June 8, 2012, Mr. Amiraslanov was arrested by
security agents from the Department for Combating Organised Crime (DCOC) of the
Ministry of Internal Affairs. He was subsequently charged with "illegal
possession of firearms and ammunition" under Article 228.1 of the
Azerbaijan Criminal Code. On September 12, 2012 he was sentenced to two years
in prison by the Sabirabad District Court and on January 25, 2013, the Court of
Appeal in Baku upheld the sentence.
 
Mr. Amiraslanov's trial and his detention were marred by
gross procedural irregularities and a blatant failure to adhere to established
principles guiding the conduct of fair trials. During his trial, defence
witnesses were barred from testifying while journalists were barred from
attending. 
 
While in detention, Mr. Amiraslanov was repeatedly
subjected to cruel, degrading and inhuman treatment in the form of severe
beatings and verbal abuse. The
Observatory recalls that Article 11 of the Convention against Torture
stipulates that “Each State Party shall keep under systematic review
interrogation rules, instructions, methods and practices as well as
arrangements for the custody and treatment of persons subjected to any form of
arrest, detention or imprisonment in any territory under its jurisdiction, with
a view to preventing any cases of torture”.
 
The Observatory recalls that Mr. Amiraslanov has
been active in securing the guarantee of the rights of victims of the May 2010
flooding of the Kur River and protests against corruption, inefficiency and
other irregularities in the delivery of assistance to them.
 
Action requested:
 
Please write to the authorities in Azerbaijan, urging them to:
 
i.       
Guarantee
in all circumstances the continued physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Amiraslanov;
 
ii.     
Provide
adequate and thorough medical and social rehabilitation to Mr. Amiraslanov;
 
iii.    
Put
an end to any kind of harassment - including at the judicial level - against Mr. Amiraslanov and more generally against all human rights defenders
in Azerbaijan;
 
iv.     
Release immediately and
unconditionally all human rights defenders who are currently detained in
Azerbaijan, including Messrs. Hilal Mammadov and Anar
Mammadli, as their detention is arbitrary since it only aims
at sanctioning their human rights activities;
 
v.      
Conform
with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by
the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its
Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in
association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and
realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and
international levels”, as well as its Article 12.2, which provides that the
State shall “take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the
competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others,
against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse
discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his
or her legitimate exercise of his or her rights”; 
 
vi.     
Ensure
in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in
accordance with international human rights standards and international
instruments ratified by Azerbaijan.
