The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a partnership of the
World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and the FIDH, requests your urgent
intervention in the following situation in Sudan.

 
Description of the situation:
 
The Observatory has been informed by the African Centre for Justice and Peace Studies (ACJPS) about the arbitrary detention of Messrs. Hashim Ali Ahmed and Osman Albagir Osman, two community leaders from Port Sudan, Red Sea state.  
 
According
to the information received, on December 11, 2017, Messrs. Hashim Ali Ahmed and
Osman Albagir Osman were summoned to National Intelligence and Security Services
(NISS) offices after leading a peaceful protest of the Bishareen tribe members
against activities of the Sudanese mining company “Abor Shirish” contracted by
the government to search for gold in a number of archaeological sites in
Halayib locality, Red Sea state. 
 
At
the NISS offices of Port Sudan, Messrs. Hashim Ali Ahmed and Osman Albagir
Osman were forced to record statements indicating that they would desist from
mobilising protests against the mining company, before being released the same
day. Despite these statements, they continued to protest against the mining
activities. 
 
On 17
December 2017, the two leaders were intercepted by
the NISS and arrested while they were travelling from Port Sudan to Halayib
locality, accompanied by a delegation of archaeologists from the Sudanese Antiquities Department. The community leaders were then taken to the
NISS offices in Port Sudan where they remained in detention until they were
transferred to Khartoum on December 29, 2017, where they are still being held
under NISS custody. 
 
They were held incommunicado without charge being brought against them, nor being granted access to their lawyers and families until January 7, 2018, when they had access to one family visit. However, the transfer from Port Sudan to Khartoum will hinder access of their families since Khartoum is approximately 800 kilometres from Port Sudan. They still have not had access to their lawyers.  
The
Observatory strongly condemns the arbitrary detention of Messrs. Hashim Ali
Ahmed and Osman Albagir Osman, as it clearly aimed at hindering their peaceful
and legitimate human rights activities, and express its upmost concern for the
use of incommunicado detention which significantly enhances vulnerability to
torture and ill-treatment. 
 
The
Observatory calls upon Sudanese authorities to immediately and unconditionally
release Messrs. Hashim Ali Ahmed and Osman Albagir Osman and in the meantime to
guarantee their physical and psychological integrity and their right to a fair
trial.
 
Actions requested:

     Albagir Osman;

     Osman Albagir Osman;

More generally, ensure in all
     circumstances the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in
