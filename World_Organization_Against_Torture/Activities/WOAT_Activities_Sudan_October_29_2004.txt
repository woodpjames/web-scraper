Brief Description of the Situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Sudan Organisation against Torture (SOAT), a member of the OMCT network, of the arrest of:  1.   Yagoub Abdella Yagoub, 18 years old 2.   Musa Ahmed Mohamed Kamees, 32 years old 3.   Hamid Abdel Majeed Ateam, 17 years old 4.   Mohamed Mahmoud Abdella Hassan, 15 years old  According to the information received, these two men and two minors from the Birgit tribe and resident in Janjonat, were arrested on 6 October 2004, by the Armed Forces and the Military Intelligence, from a place between Janjonat and Labanti villages, near Doumma, 12 km North of Nyala.   According to the information provided, they were initially taken to the military intelligence offices in Nyala and detained there for 4 days. They were then moved to Nyala Central (Wasat) police station and remained there for 7 days. Finally, the two men and two minors were moved to Nyala prison where they are currently being detained.   Also according to the information, while in the military intelligence offices in Nyala, they were subjected to torture in order them to confess their involvement with rebel group. They were beaten with sticks and kicked with boots on their stomach, heads and backs and all over their bodies.   All four are reportedly charged with joining the Sudan Liberation Army (SLA) and committing crimes against the state under articles 50 (Offences against the State, undermining the Constitutional System), 51 (Waging war against the state), 58 (Offences relating to Disciplinary Forces – Abetment of Mutiny), 107 (Screening or harbouring offenders) of the 1991 Penal Code, which carries the death penalty.  SOAT’s lawyers have visited the detainees in Nyala prison and submitted an application on 26 October 2004 to the Attorney General requesting a medical examination of the detainees.    The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned about the physical and psychological integrity of the detainees Yagoub Abdella Yagoub, Musa Ahmed Mohamed Kamees, Hamid Abdel Majeed Ateam, and Mohamed Mahmoud Abdella Hassan and urges the Sudanese authorities to ensure that they will undergo a fair trial, in which statements made as a result of torture will not be invoked as evidence against them. Concerning the cases of 17 year old Hamid Abdel Majeed Ateam and 15 year old Mohamed Mahmoud Abdella Hassan, OMCT recalls that Sudan, as a state party to the Convention of the Rights of the Child, is bound by the provisions that a child shall only be deprived of liberty “(…) as a measure of last resort and for the shortest appropriate period of time” (Art. 37 (b)), as well as the “guarantee to be presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law (i) and to have the matter determined without delay by a competent, independent and impartial authority or judicial body in a fair hearing according to law (iii)” (Art. 40, §2.(b)). Moreover under article 37(a), (b) of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, “no child shall be subjected to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment [and that] no child shall be deprived of his or her liberty unlawfully or arbitrarily.” OMCT calls on the authorities to launch prompt, thorough and impartial investigations into the circumstances of these events in order to find those responsible for any violations of human rights and to bring them to justice.
