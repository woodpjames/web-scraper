Dear Mr. President
 
We, 48 undersigned organizations from 24 countries,
strongly condemn the continuing wave of detentions and harassment of peaceful
protesters, journalists, human rights defenders, civil society activists,
anarchists and opposition party members in Belarus.
 
Most of the detentions and harassment are linked to
participation in peaceful protests demanding the cancellation of Presidential
Decree No. 3, the so-called “social parasite” legislation, which imposes a tax
on unemployed people in Belarus. Decree No. 3 obligates citizens to
work a specific number of days or pay a special duty to the State under threat
of arrest. This is contrary to Art. 41 of the Belarusian Constitution and
violates international human rights law.
 
According to reports from Belarusian and international
human rights organizations, as of 22 March 2017 more than 250 people have been
detained since 3 March 2017, including at least 31 journalists. At
least 110 people have been sentenced to 3-15 days of administrative arrest.
Many of them remain in detention, while others have been subject to different
forms of harassment.
 
We strongly condemn the fact that several detentions
of peaceful protesters at different places across Belarus have been carried out
with the excessive use of force by Belarusian security officers.
 
Several Belarusian organizations have announced a
demonstration that will take place in Minsk and in other cities in Belarus on
25 March 2017. We are deeply concerned about the physical and psychological
integrity of the participants of these protest marches.
 
As the president of Belarus we urge you:
 
- to respect the right to peaceful assembly and
expression
- to ensure that there are no obstructions to the
exercising of these rights in Belarus, including in relation to the planned
demonstration on 25 March 2017 in Minsk and in other cities across the country
- to guarantee in all circumstances the physical and
psychological integrity of all peaceful protesters at the demonstration on 25
March 2017 in Minsk as well as at all other peaceful demonstrations across
Belarus
- to refrain from the use of excessive force by
security officers on 25 March 2017 in Minsk as well as at all other peaceful
demonstrations across Belarus
- to ensure that journalists are able to fully exercise
their professional duties, including during 
peaceful demonstrations
- to immediately
and unconditionally release all protesters, journalists, human rights
defenders, civil society activists and opposition members who have been
detained in connection with the current wave of demonstrations solely for
peacefully exercising their right to freedom of assembly and expression 
- to refrain from preventively detaining journalists,
human rights defenders, civil society activists, anarchists and opposition
activists
- to immediately stop the persecution, harassment and
intimidation of those who exercise their right to freedom of assembly,
expression and association and ensure these rights to all Belarusian citizens
- to abolish Presidential Decree No. 3 since it
violates international human rights law
