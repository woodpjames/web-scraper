Brief description of the situation :  The Observatory has been informed by the Asian Human Rights Commission (AHRC) that on 30th November, Mr. Musliadi, coordinator of KaGEMPAR was kidnapped from his office in Lampriet by six men suspected to belong to the armed forces. His whereabouts still remains unknown.  KaGEMPAR is a coalition of students and youth groups based in West Aceh aimed at promoting human rights and providing humanitarian aid to human rights victims in the Aceh area which has been active in advocating human rights among students and the public. The coalition reports human rights violations committed by the Indonesian army in Aceh. The kidnapping of Mr. Musliadi occurs in a particularly tense moment as the GAM (Gerakan Aceh Merdeka – Free Aceh Mouvement), celebrates its 26th anniversary on December 4th and peace talks will be held in Geneva between GAM and the Indonesian government on December 9th.  Since 1976, the province of Aceh has been the scene of continuous fights between the GAM, who claims for its independence and the security forces sent by the State which have caused numerous victims among the civil population and serious human rights violations such as disappearances, extra judicial killings, and burnings. Several sources hold the Security forces responsible of the large majority of human rights abuses. Due to this tense situation, human rights organisations like KaGEMPAR, that are mobilizing to denounce the situation of impunity which prevails in the region, have become a major target of repression.  The Observatory expresses its serious concern for the safety of Mr. Musliadi.  The Observatory  fears that his kidnapping is linked to his involvement in human rights monitoring activities and aimed at dissuading him and his organisation to carry out their work.  Action requested:  Please write to the Indonesian authorities urging them to:  1.	Find the whereabouts of Mr. Musliadi,  guarantee his security and physical integrity in all circumstances and take all the measures to release him immediately   2.	Order an immediate investigation into this attack, in order to identify those responsible, bring them to trial and apply the penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions as provided by law; arrest, charge and bring to court the perpetrators of the attack;  3.	Put an end to all forms of harassment and threats all human rights defenders and their organisations in Indonesia;  4.
