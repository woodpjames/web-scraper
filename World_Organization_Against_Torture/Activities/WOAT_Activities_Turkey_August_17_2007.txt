Brief description of the situation: The Observatory has been informed by the Human Rights Association (Insan Haklari Dernegi - IHD) about the sentencing of three members of the Adana branch of the Association for criticising the “Return to Life” military operations of December 2000 and the prison conditions of Kurdish leader Abdullah Öcalan. According to the information received, on June 7, 2007, Mr. Ethem Acikalin, President of the IHD branch in Adana, Mr. Mustafa Bagcicek, Secretary General, and Mr. Hüseyin Beyaz, Financial Secretary, were sentenced by the Adana Criminal Court n°1 to two years and eight months’ imprisonment for “inciting hatred and hostility” and “praising crime and criminals” (Article 215 of the Criminal Code). On the same day, the three men appealed their sentence before the Appeal Court in Ankara (Yargitay). They will remain free until the decision of the court, which should take place within one year. The Observatory recalls that on December 19, 2000, the military had organised the “Return to life” military operations that had been launched simultaneously in 22 prisons all over Turkey in order to end two months of hunger strikes and “death fasts” carried out by hundreds of political prisoners, and which resulted in the death of 31 people, two of them soldiers. At that time, the hunger strikers were protesting against the State’s plan to transfer its prisoners from large wards to “F-type” prisons (characterised by small one- and three-person cells, where continued isolation leaves prisoners particularly vulnerable to torture and other forms of ill treatment). On December 18, 2005, Mr. Ethem Acikalin, Mr. Mustafa Bagcicek and Mr. Hüseyin Beyaz had organised a demonstration, protesting against these military operations and calling for the prosecution of those responsible for these violations. The second charge was brought after they criticised, in the press release issued at the occasion of the demonstration, Mr. Öcalan’s solitary confinement in Imrali Prison. Action requested: Please write to the authorities of Turkey urging them to :  Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Ethem Acikalin, Mr. Mustafa Bagcicek and Mr. Hüseyin Beyaz, as well as of all human rights defenders in Turkey; Ensure that their rights to a fair and impartial trial be guaranteed when appealing their sentences, so that the charges against them be dropped, as they are arbitrary; Put an end to acts of harassment against all human rights defenders in Turkey; Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on December 9, 1998, especially its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually or in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, its Article 5, which provides that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, [...] to meet or assemble peacefully”, its Article 6.b, which states that “everyone has the right [...] to freely to publish, impart or disseminate to others views, information and knowledge on all human rights and fundamental freedoms” and its Article 12.2 which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection  by the competent authorities of everyone, individually or in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”; Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by Turkey, including the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment and Punishment, which was ratified by Turkey in 1988.
