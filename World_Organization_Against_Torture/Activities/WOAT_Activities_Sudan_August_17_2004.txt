(See SDN 006/0704/OBS 062.)   Correction:  The Observatory has been informed by the Sudan Organization Against Torture (SOAT) that, contrary to the information issued in the appeal and based on SOAT’s information, the link between the arrest of Mr. Aba Zer Ahmed Abu Al Bashir and his submission, eight days earlier, of a written request to the Governor of Southern Darfur state to put an end to the conflict in the state, is not clearly established. Moreover, SOAT informed the Observatory that the ten peace activists and tribal leaders who submitted the written request were actually not arrested. Finally, Mr. Adel Abdullah Nasir Aldeain Saeed, cited in the July 30 appeal as still detained, was released on June 23, 2004.  The Observatory offers its apologies for any inconvenience that this misleading information may have caused.        The Observatory, a FIDH and OMCT venture, is dedicated to the protection of Human Rights Defenders and aims to offer them concrete support in their time of need.  The Observatory was the winner of the 1998 Human Rights Prize of the French Republic.
