Description of the situation: The Observatory has been informed by the Kenyan Independent Medico-Legal Unit (IMLU) that Dr. Walter Wekesa Nalianya, who participated in documenting human rights violations in Mount Elgon Hospital Kitale (Western Province of Kenya) in regard to Mount Elgon torture cases[1], was summoned by police early on 14 August 2008. According to the information received, Dr. Wekesa Nalianya, a registered doctor with the Medical Practitioners and Dentist Board (registration number A. 4018) practising at Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital, was summoned by police and taken to Kakamega’s Provincial Criminal Investigation Office (PCIO), where he is currently being interrogated. The police allege that Dr. Wekesa Nalianya is not registered under private practice and thus ought not to have documented the Mount Elgon torture allegations. Dr. Wekesa Nalianya reportedly documented human rights violations in Mount Elgon Hospital Kitale for the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights’ (KNCHR) report, which was released in May 2008. He has also actively collaborated with IMLU, a registered NGO working for the rights of torture victims in Kenya, on examining torture cases. The Observatory expresses its deep concern about the summoning and interrogation of Dr. Wekesa Nalianya and fears that these acts are only intended to intimidate and prevent him from carrying out his human rigths activities. The Observatory also recalls that according to Article 12.2 of the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 9, 1998, “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”. Actions required: Please write to the Kenyan authorities, urging them to:   Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Dr. Walter Wekesa Nalianya;  Release him immediately and unconditionally;  Put an end to all acts of harassment against Dr. Walter Wekesa Nalianya as well as against all human rights defenders in Kenya;   Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly on December 9, 1998, especially its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, as well as above-mentioned Article 12.2;  More generally, ensure in all circumstances the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international and regional human rights instruments ratified by Kenya.

OMCT had received information from IMLU and the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ), both members of OMCT SOS Torture Network, concerning torture and extra-judicial killings by the Kenyan Army and Police in the Mount Elgon District in the context of operations against the Sabaot Land Defence Force (SLDF), a guerrilla militia. In March 2008, the Kenyan Army was deployed in the Mount Elgon area to clamp down on the activities of the SLDF in an action called “Operation Okoa Maisha”. It has resulted in mass arrests and the subsequent prosecution of over 1200 persons.
