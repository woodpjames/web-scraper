Brief description of the situation: The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources of the existence of a death list issued by Zimbabwean secret services, which includes the names of several human rights defenders, journalists and political opponents, in particular Mr. Arnold Tsunga, executive director of Zimbabwe Lawyer for Human Rights (ZLHR), FIDH vice-president and a member of  the Zimbabwe Human Rights Association (ZimRights), Mr. Lovemore Madhuku, president of the National Constitutional Assembly (NCA), Mr. Raymond Majongwe, Secretary General of the Progressive Teachers’ Union of Zimbabwe, and Messrs. Gift Phiri and Wilf Nyarota, respectively journalist and editor of The Zimbabwean, an independent newspaper. According to the information received, Mr. Arnold Tsunga was informed of the existence of this list at the beginning of April 2007. The necessary verifications made since then show that it was issued by the Central Intelligence Organisation on March 22, 2007 and signed by Commander Eno. It specifies that “these persons pose a security risk” and indicates that the executions “fall under the purview of Zimbabwe Intelligence Corps (ZIC) and Zanu PF Security Hit Squad”. The Observatory is very concerned by these threats against Messrs. Tsunga, Madhuku, Majongwe, Phiri and Nyarota which emanate from the highest levels of the Zimbabwean State. These persons have already been seriously threatened and attacked in the past. In particular, Mr. Phiri was abducted and tortured in March 2007. The list also includes the names of political opponents, i.e. the name of Messrs. Morgan Tsvangirai, head of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC - main opposition party), who was also severely tortured in March 2007. The Observatory notes with great concern that these facts occur in the context of organised violence and torture against human rights defenders and political opponents in the run up to the 2008 elections and that part of the execution of this plan involves highly mechanised and mobile hit squad that have been set up to attack them. Actions required: Please write to the authorities of Zimbabwe urging them to:  Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Messrs. Arnold Tsunga, Lovemore Madhuku, Raymond Majongwe, Phiri and Nyarota, as well as all the persons mentioned on the list; Conduct a fair, impartial and independent inquiry into these threats, in order to bring the authors to justice and pronounce sentences proportional to the gravity of their crimes; Put an end to all acts of harassment against Messrs. Arnold Tsunga, Lovemore Madhuku, Raymond Majongwe, Phiri and Nyarota, as well as all other human rights defenders in Zimbabwe; Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels” and article 12.2, which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”; Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by Zimbabwe.
