The Observatory for the Protection 
of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the International Federation for 
Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), has 
received new information and requests your urgent intervention in the following 
situation in Kyrgyzstan.
New 
information:
The Observatory has been informed 
by reliable sources that on 
April 30, 2015, the Osh Regional Court nullified three search warrants 
previously issued by the Osh City Court, which had allowed the State Committee 
of National Security (SCNS) to search the Bir Duino premises in the city of Osh 
as well as both houses of human rights lawyers Messrs. Valerian Vakhitov 
and Khusanbay Saliev[1] (see background 
information). The searches took place on March 27, 2015 in violation of the 
Kyrgyz legislation on the practice of lawyers and in particular its Article 29, 
which provides that “any interference with a lawyer's work is prohibited, unless 
a lawsuit is filed against him” and clearly states that authors of such undue 
interference shall be prosecuted.
Still on April 
30, the Osh City Court, which was supposed to hear a complaint filed by Messrs. 
Vakhitov and Saliev against the SCNS on the basis of the same Article 29, 
refused to consider it. The Court argued that since the Osh Regional Court 
already ruled against the three search warrants, the complaint had been 
automatically dismissed.
A 
few weeks before these developments, another Kyrgyz lawyer faced judicial 
harassment. Indeed, on April 14, 2015, an investigator 
of the Department of Internal Affairs of Karakol City issued a decision ordering 
the removal of lawyer Nurkyz 
Asanova from the 
representation of her client, Mr. Ishen Abdrashev. The decision came after Ms. 
Asanova filed a lawsuit on behalf of her client against police officers, 
accusing them of acts of torture and forced labour. It is therefore feared that 
the removal decision is aimed at sanctioning her human rights activities as a 
lawyer.
The 
Observatory expresses its deepest concern over the continued harassment of human 
rights lawyers in Kyrgyzstan, and calls upon authorities in Kyrgyzstan to put an 
end to any act of harassment, including at the judicial level, against all human 
rights defenders in Kyrgyzstan.
Background 
information:
On March 27, 2015, at 4.20 pm, 
officers from the Osh Office of the SCNS searched the premises of the Osh office 
of Bir Duino. The Osh City court decision issuing the search warrant was taken 
on the basis of a criminal case filed against Mr. Umar Faruk[2], a US journalist, under 
Article 13 of the Penal Code on charges of “countering extremism activity by 
confiscating forbidden material of religious character”. 
On that occasion, the officers 
from the SCNS seized computers, material related to criminal cases and USB 
drives containing working documents on human rights issues. Four staff members 
were in the Bir Duino office at that moment. Subsequently, a number of 
colleagues, partners, human rights lawyers, as well as a representative of the 
Ombudsman office of the Osh region and a member of Parliament, Ms. Alnura 
Altinaeva, came on the spot, but were denied access to the premises.
SCNS officers also searched and 
seized work material at the place of residence of lawyers, Messrs. Valerian 
Vakhitov and Khusanbay Saliev.
The above-mentioned searches and 
confiscations were carried out on the basis of an illegal judicial decision. In 
addition, the seizure of material at the place of residence of Messrs. Vakhitov 
and Saliev violates Kyrgyz legislation guaranteeing the immunity of professional 
documents of lawyers.
On April 6 and 
8, 2015 the brother and father of Mr. Khusanbay Saliev, were summoned for 
questioning at the Department of the State Committee of National Security in the 
city of Osh. Both were questioned without legal basis for the second time since 
March 27, 2015. 
The Observatory 
further recalls that this is not the first time that Bir Duino and its 
representatives are facing harassment. In July and December 2013[3] already, unidentified 
individuals broke into the Bishkek office of Bir Duino to stole money as well as 
the video surveillance camera and five laptops which contained key data of the 
organisation. Bir Duino staff members and Director, Ms. Tolekan 
Ismailova, have also been judicially harassed and slandered on several 
occasions[4].
