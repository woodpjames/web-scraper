Brief description of the situation: The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources of the new death threats sent to Ms. Shirin Ebadi, lawyer and Nobel Peace Price winner in 2003. According to the information received, on April 5, 2008, Ms. Ebadi received an anonymous letter in her office, in which she was threatened to death. Ms. Ebadi immediately wrote to the police to denounce these threats and to recall that she has been receiving death threats for years. In this document, she added that she was convinced that this campaign against her was due to her activities in favour of human rights. Ms. Ebadi left Iran two days later and asked her lawyers not to express themselves publicly during one week, in order to see if the police would carry out an investigation. However, no investigation has yet been undertaken. The Observatory expresses its deep concern about these new death threats against Ms. Shirin Ebadi, as it seems to merely aim at sanctioning her human rights activities, and about the ongoing harsh repression of the Iranian authorities against human rights defenders in general. The Observatory further wishes to insist on the fact that Iran had committed to “uphold the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights” by presenting its candidacy to the Human Rights Council 2006 election and had insisted in this regard on the fact that the country had “continuously put great efforts into safeguarding the status and inherent dignity of the human person as well as the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms”. In order to ensure the continuation of these efforts, the Observatory urges the Islamic Republic of Iran to conform with international human rights standards. Actions requested: Please write to the authorities in Iran urging them to:   Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Ms. Shirin Ebadi;  Order a thorough and impartial investigation into the above-mentioned threats, in order to identify all those responsible, bring them before a civil competent and impartial tribunal and apply to them the penal sanctions provided by the law;  Put an end to any act of harassment against Ms. Shirin Ebadi and against all human rights defenders in Iran;  Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, Article 6.b, which provides that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others [...] freely to publish, impart or disseminate to others views, information and knowledge on all human rights and fundamental freedoms”, and Article 12.2, which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”;  More generally, ensure in all circumstances the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with international and regional human rights instruments ratified by Iran.
