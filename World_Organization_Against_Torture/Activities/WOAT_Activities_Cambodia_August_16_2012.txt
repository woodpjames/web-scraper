The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of
the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation
Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent intervention in the following
situation in Cambodia.
 
Description of the situation:
 
The
Observatory has been informed by reliable sources of a citation to appear in
court issued against Mr. Chan Soveth, Senior Investigator and Deputy
Head of the Monitoring Section of the Cambodian Human
Rights and Development Association (ADHOC).
 
According
to the information received, on August 9, 2012, the Phnom Penh Municipal Court
issued a citation summoning Mr. Soveth to appear before an investigating judge
on August 24, 2012.
 
Mr.
Soveth was charged with “providing assistance to the perpetrator” of a “crime”
under Article 544 of the Cambodian Criminal Code, and faces an imprisonment
sentence of one to three years and a fine of two million to six million Riels. 
 
Exact
details behind this charge have not yet been disclosed by the government, but
they appear to be connected to a long-standing land dispute in Kratie province.
On May 16, 2012, the government sent in hundreds of armed security personnel,
supported by helicopters, to evict villagers who were living in an area in
Kratie province marked for development by a Russian company. During the
eviction, Ms. Heng Chantha, a 14-year-old girl, was shot dead. Government
officials later justified the operation by claiming the villagers, some of whom
are members of the Independent Democrats Association, were part of a secession
movement. ADHOC released a statement on May 17 and condemned the killing of the
young girl[1].
It is believed that the charges against Mr. Soveth are linked to his sheltering
 of a land activist involved in this issue.
The court citation was signed on August 9, 2012, just eight days after Prime
Minister Hun Sen made accusatory references in a nationally televised speech to
an unnamed “human rights worker” for his role in providing assistance to
villagers in relation to this land dispute. 
 
The
Observatory recalls that ADHOC has been repeatedly harassed by the government
in recent years. In July 2012, armed police officers raided a training session
on land rights organised jointly by ADHOC and the Cambodian Centre for Human
Rights (CCHR) in Rattanakiri province[2].
Moreover, Mr. Soum Chankea, ADHOC’s Provincial Coordinator in Banteay Meanchey
province, faced spurious charges of defamation, which the court eventually
dropped in June 2012. Furthermore, in January 2011, Mr. Sam Chankea, ADHOC’s
coordinator in Kampong Chhnang province, was convicted of defamation, in
connection to a critical statement he made about land-grabbing by a Cambodian
company during an interview with Radio Free Asia in December 2009[3].
 
On
July 2012, independent radio station owner Mr. Mam Sonando was arrested and is
currently in pre-trial detention in Phnom Penh, facing charges of 'secession'
in relation to the same land dispute in Kratie[4].
The government has yet to present any credible evidence substantiating its
claims that a secessionist movement exists in Kratie.
 
The Observatory
expresses its deepest concern about these acts of judicial harassment of Mr.
Chan Soveth, since they seem to merely aim at hindering his human rights
activities, in a context of continued governmental harassment against human
rights defenders, including against other ADHOC members. The Observatory therefore
calls upon the Cambodian authorities to stop any judicial actions against Mr.
Chan Soveth aimed at curbing his legitimate human rights work and to put an end
to all acts of harassment against him as well as against all human rights
defenders in Cambodia.
 
Actions requested:
 
Please write to the
Cambodian authorities and ask them to:
 
i.   
Put
an end to all acts of harassment – including at the judicial level – against
Mr. Chan Soveth as well as against all human rights defenders and their
organisations in Cambodia;
 
ii.  
Guarantee
in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of all human rights defenders and their
organisations in Cambodia;
 
iii. Conform with the provisions of the
Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted on December 9, 1998 by the
United Nations General Assembly, and in particular :
-     
Article
1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually or in association
with others, to promote the protection and realization of human rights and
fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, 
-   
 and Article 12.2 which provides that “the State
shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent
authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against
any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination,
pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her
legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”.
 
iv. Ensure in all
circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance
with international human rights standards and international instruments
ratified by Cambodia.
