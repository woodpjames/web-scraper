July 15, 2010
The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), has received new information and requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in Zimbabwe.
New information:
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources, including the Zimbabwe Human Rights Association (ZimRights), about the release on bail of Mr. Farai Maguwu, Director of the Centre for Research and Development (CRD), who was arbitrarily detained since June 3, 2010 at the Harare remand prison.
According to the information received, on July 12, 2010, Harare High Court Judge Mawadze Gurainesu released Mr. Farai Maguwu on bail, despite the State’s argument that his release would compromise the results of the ongoing investigation. Instead, Judge Gurainesu agreed with Mr. Maguwu’s lawyer that the State is taking too long to investigate and therefore it would not be lawful to keep him in remand for allegations that are yet to be proven.
Mr. Farai Maguwu was granted bail on conditions of the payment of a 1,500 USD bail deposit, daily reporting to Mutare central police station, that he resides in his home in Mutare and that he does not travel more than 40 km from Mutare, except for the purpose of court hearing in Harare.
As of issuing this urgent appeal, the police investigation was still ongoing and Mr. Farai Maguwu’s trial date was yet to be set. If found guilty of the charges of “communicating and publishing falsehoods against the State with the intention to cause prejudice to the security or economic interests of the country” (Section 31 of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act), Mr. Maguwu would face up to 20 years’ imprisonment.
The Observatory welcomes Mr. Farai Maguwu’s release on bail and thanks all the persons, institutions and organisations who intervened in his favour. However, the Observatory remains concerned by the ongoing judicial harassment faced by Mr. Maguwu, which seems to merely aim at sanctioning his human rights activities, and calls upon the Zimbabwean authorities to put an immediate end to it.
Background information:
Mr. Farai Maguwu was arrested on June 3, 2010 in Mutare and accused of “communicating and publishing falsehoods against the State with the intention to cause prejudice to the security or economic interests of the country”. He appeared in court on June 7, 2010 and then on June 10, 2010, when the Harare Lower Court denied him bail for the first time.
Mr. Maguwu is accused of having handed over a CRD report on human rights violations that are taking place in the diamond-mining area of Chiadzwa to the Kimberley Process Monitor during his visit to Zimbabwe in May 2010[1], which he denies. The report includes cases of unlawful arrests and detentions, torture and extra-judicial executions allegedly perpetrated by the police, the army and security agents, in connection with diamond mining, whether legal or not. The CRD has played a central role in recording human rights abuses carried out by state security agents against local people in the Marange diamond fields, and has frequently made this information available to Kimberley Process participant governments and working groups. However, Kimberley Process participant countries have so far failed to reach consensus on suspending Zimbabwe from membership.
While in detention, Mr. Farai Maguwu has been denied access to the medication he was taking to cure a sore throat, chest infections and a fever he was suffering from. On June 11, 2010, without notifying his legal representatives or relatives, the Law and Order section of the police transferred Mr. Farai Maguwu from Harare remand prison to Matapi police station. He was returned to the Harare remand prison on the evening of June 13, 2010. When he asked for his medication, prison authorities stated that it was too late to resume the course and offered him substitute medication, which he declined out of suspicion.
On June 16, 2010, Mr. Maguwu's lawyer reported the facts to High Court Judge Justice Mr. Chinembiri Bhunu, who ordered Mr. Maguwu to be examined fortnightly by a medical practitioner of his own choice. On June 17, 2010, he was admitted at Avenues Clinic, where he underwent a throat surgery on June 18, 2010. On the same day, one of his guards, known as “Murigani”, put him into leg irons and chains as he was laying on his bed.
On June 21, 2010, the High Court of Justice dismissed an application filed by Mr. Farai Maguwu seeking his release on bail. He was further removed from the hospital where he was recovering from a throat surgery and sent back to prison in spite of his dire state.
On July 2, 2010, a Harare Magistrate denied Mr. Farai Maguwu bail, who was again remanded in custody until July 14 in order to allow the State time for further investigations.
On July 1, 2010, a police inspector had admitted before the court that the investigations were moving at a slow pace and that he had failed to interview a key State witness in the case against Mr. Maguwu.
