The Observatory for the Protection of
Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of FIDH and the World
Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), has received new information and requests
your urgent intervention in the following situation in
Egypt.
 
New information:
 
The Observatory has been
informed by reliable sources about the ongoing judicial harassment and the
restrictions to freedom of association faced by at least 37 Egyptian human
rights defenders and organisations, including the Cairo Institute for Human
Rights Studies (CIHRS) and the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR),
two member organisations of FIDH, the Arab Network for Human Rights Information
(ANHRI), the Hisham Mubarak Law Center (HMLC), Nazra for Feminist Studies, the
Egyptian Centre for the Right to Education (CRE), as well as the Arab
Center for the Independence of the Judiciary and the Legal Profession (ACIJLP)
and the Land Center for Human Rights (LCHR), two member organisations of OMCT.
 
According to information
received, on August 15, 2016, the Cairo Criminal Court in Zeinhom decided to
postpone to September 17 the ruling on the asset freeze order targeting 11
human rights defenders and family members within the framework of criminal case
No. 173/2011, known as the “civil society case” (see Background information).
The defendants include seven human rights defenders: Mr. Hossam Bahgat, founder
of EIPR, Mr. Gamal Eid, Director of ANHRI, Mr. Moustafa El Hassan,
Director of HMLC, Mr. Abdel Hafiz Tayel, Executive Director of CRE, Mr. Bahey
Eldin Hassan, Director of CIHRS, and two other CIHRS employees, as well as
Mr. Bahey Eldin Hassan and Mr. Gamal Eid’s respective wives and daughters. 
 
These developments are
the latest escalation in a campaign of judicial harassment launched by the
authorities in 2011 targeting civil society organisations and human rights
defenders in Egypt[1]. 
 
The Observatory urges the Egyptian authorities to immediately cease all
acts of harassment against human rights organisations, and to comply with its
Constitution (in particular Article 78 and Article 93 which respectively
recognise freedom of association and Egypt's compliance
with international human rights conventions ratified by Egypt) as well as its international legal
obligations (in particular Article 22 of the International Covenant on Civil
and Political Rights (ICCPR)) and its international commitment to respect
freedom of association in the framework of its Universal Periodic Review (UPR)[2].

 


 
Background information:
 
Since 2011, the Egyptian
Government has launched a judicial harassment campaign against civil society
organisations on the pretext that they received unauthorised foreign funding
under criminal case No. 173/2011, known as the “civil society case”.
 
The 2011 Government
Fact-Finding Committee report, which formed the basis of the first trial in
2012, listed 37 NGOs who could be targeted under this “civil society case”.
That list included ACIJLP, CIHRS, LCHR, the Egyptian Democratic Academy (EDA),
HMLC, ANHRI, EIPR, El Nadim Center for the Management and Rehabilitation of
Victims of Violence and Torture, the Egyptian Center for Economic and Social
Rights (ECESR), the Arab Penal Reform Organization, the Egyptian Center for the
Right to Education, El-Haq, the Egyptian Association for Community
Participation Enhancement (ACPE), Nazra for Feminist Studies, the Appropriate
Communications Technologies (ACT), among others.
 
The first set of
investigations targeted international and foreign NGOs. On June 4, 2013, the
North Cairo Criminal Court sentenced 43 Egyptian and foreign staff members of
five foreign civil society organisations to imprisonment ranging from one
(suspended) to five years of prison for “managing unlicensed branches” of their
organisations, “conducting research, political training, surveys, and workshops
without licenses”, “training political parties and groups” and “illegally receiving
foreign funding”. Though none of the defendants were forced to serve their
sentences either because they were abroad or in the case of the junior staff
had their sentences suspended, the court ordered the confiscation of their
funds and the closure of Egypt-based branches of Freedom House, the
International Republican Institute, the National Democratic Institute, the
International Centre for Journalists (ICFJ), and Konrad Adenauer Foundation. 
 
The second part of the case targets
Egyptian civil society organisations that have received foreign or
international funding. In July 2014, the Ministry of Social Solidarity (MoSS)
issued an ultimatum for Egyptian human rights organisations to register by late
2014 under Law 84/2002 or face closure[3].
 
In September 2014, President Al-Sisi
signed into law amendments to Article 78 of the Penal Code. These amendments
include the provision that receiving foreign funding for the purpose of
“harming national security” is punishable by life imprisonment.
 
In late 2014, the Investigating
Judge in charge of the case appointed a technical committee from the MoSS[4] to determine
whether Egyptian organisations under review operate as civic associations
without being registered as such under Law 84/2002, and to examine documents related
to their sources of funding. The committee first examined the EDA. It is noteworthy to note that despite the EDA's
registration in compliance with the ultimatum[5],
they are still being investigated. In January 2015, the judge issued
travel bans against Messrs. Hossam al-Din Ali, Chairman of the EDA, Ahmed
Ghoneim, Deputy, as well as Ms. Israa Abdel Fattah and Bassem
Samir, who previously worked in the same organisation.
 
On June 9, 2015, the Investigating Judge mandated the technical committee to visit the
Cairo office of the CIHRS in order to examine whether the CIHRS engages in
activities of civic associations under the provisions of Law 84/2002. The
committee requested the staff present in the office to provide documentation
relating to the administration of the NGO, such as its registration, founding
contract and statute, as well as the budgets, financial accounts, and funding
contracts for the past four years. One additional demand the staff were
instructed to comply with was to provide documentation that proved that the
CIHRS was not conducting NGO work. 
 
 
In July 2015, the HMLC
was also subjected to the same review.
 
In December 2015, the
ANHRI received a phone call from the technical committee, which asked to
conduct an inspection, but due to the absence of Mr. Gamal Eid, the visit was
postponed and eventually did not take place. 
 
In December 2015, the
Egyptian Center for the Right to Education was summoned by the Investigating
Judge for questioning.
 
On February 4, 2016,
Mr. Gamal Eid was informed of a
travel ban as he was attempting to travel outside Egypt. Mr. Hossam Bahgat was informed of a
similar ban on February 23, 2016; Mr. Mohamed Zaree, CIHRS Egypt Director, on
May 27, 2016; Ms. Hoda Abdel Wahab, ACIJLP
Executive Director, and Mr. Nasser Amin, ACIJLP President, on
June 20, 2016 and July 14, 2016 respectively; and Ms. Mozn Hassan, Founder and Executive Director of Nazra for Feminist
Studies, on June 27, 2016.
 
On March 13 and 14, 2016,
two staff members of CIHRS and three staff members of Nazra for Feminist
Studies were notified by telephone of a summons to appear on March 16 before
the Investigating Judge in Cairo within the framework of criminal case No.
173/2011. However, the two staff members of CIHRS refused to appear, as they
had not been properly notified in person in accordance with the law in force.
Two former staff members of the Andalus Institute for Tolerance and
Anti-Violence Studies and one accountant from the United Group were also
summoned within the same context.
 
On March 17, Messrs.
Hossam Bahgat and Gamal Eid were informed that the Investigative Judge had
ordered the freezing of their assets and that their case would be reviewed by
the Cairo Criminal Court in Zeinhom on March 24, 2016. The case was
subsequently adjourned to April 20, 2016, upon request from the Public
Prosecutor. 
 
On April 19, Mr. Bahey
eldin Hassan, two staff members of CIHRS, as well as Mr. Moustafa El Hassan,
HMLC Director, were informed at 9pm through a phone call from the Egyptian
police that they were summoned to appear before the Cairo Criminal Court in
Zeinhom on April 20, along with Messrs. Bahgat and Eid.
 
On April 20, the Cairo
Criminal Court in Zeinhom added seven defendants from three additional NGOs to
the “asset freeze order” initially targeting Messrs.
Hossam Bahgat and Gamal Eid. The additional
defendants are Mr. Bahey eldin Hassan, Mr. Moustafa El Hassan, Mr. Abdel Hafiz Tayel, two staff members of CIHRS, as well as of Mr.
Bahey eldin Hassan's wife and daughter and Mr. Gamal Eid's wife and daughter[6].

 
The hearing by the Cairo
Criminal Court in Zeinhom regarding the asset freeze order was postponed
several times by the prosecutors to review the evidence and formally summon the
new defendants. On May 23, 2016, it was again adjourned to July 17, 2016, and
then to August 15.

[1] The investigation started in September 2011, and the raid on NGOs
took place in December 2011. As the investigation has been ongoing for nearly
five years, the scope of the case remains unknown. For more information, please
see: http://www.cihrs.org/?p=720&lang=en
& http://www.cihrs.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/The-Complaint.pdf


[2] At the occasion of the UPR of Egypt in November 2014, the Egyptian
authorities accepted at least five recommendations on the protection of human
rights defenders, including a commitment to reforming the current NGO law with
a wide consultation of NGOs, and a commitment to guarantee the right to freedom
of association in accordance with international standards.


[3] The ultimatum was made public in July 2014, and in September 2014,
the deadline was pushed back to November 10, 2014.


[4] The committee is composed of Ministry of Social Solidarity officials
but they report to the Investigating Judge. 


[5] The EDA has been registered under the Associations
Law No. 84/2002 since September 2014.


[6] Mr. Bahgat attended the April-20 hearing, while the other defendants
were represented by their lawyers. No formal charges were confirmed on that
occasion.
