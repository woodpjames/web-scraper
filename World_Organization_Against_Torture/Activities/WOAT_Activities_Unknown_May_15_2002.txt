Brief description of the situation   The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by Red de Apoyo por la Justicia y la Paz  (Redepaz), that Luis Martínez, Marvin Rangel, and  Maiker Enrique Duno were subjected to ill-treatment, harassment and threats by several members of the Municipal Police of Sucre, in Caracas.  According to the information received, on April 30th, 2002, at around 11:30 a.m., 27-year old Luis Martínez, 20-year old Marvin Rangel, and 19-year old Maiker Enrique Duno were arrested in front of the Barrio 12 de octubre, in Petare, Caracas, by plainclothes policemen who belonged to the Municipal Police of Sucre.  The police ordered them to “stop” and after they were arrested, they were taken in white Jeep bearing no number plates to the headquarters of the Municipal Police of Sucre.  According to the report, when Luis Martínez;  Marvin Rangel, and Maiker Enrique Duno arrived to the station, they were taken to room where they found 10 plainclothes civilians waiting for them.  The policemen ordered them to kneel down and proceeded to beat them on the head, back, and thorax, punching and hitting them with cascos as well as kicking them in various parts of the body.  They were reportedly threatened with death if they filed a complaint against them.  This went on for several hours, and then they were described as “scourge of the neighbourhood” (“azotes de barrio”) and “truck thieves” (“ladrones de camionetas”)  According to the information received, after these events the aforementioned men continue to be harassed by the police officers who were involved in the incident.  According to the complaints, these policemen have repeatedly gone to the area where the three young men work and have stared at them threateningly.
