Mohamed Hussein and Mrs Nadia Mohamed Ahmed. Mrs.  Magda Ibrahim El Beh, part-time field worker of the Center, received  a six month suspended sentence.  This verdict puts an end to a case that started on 30 June 2000, when  Dr. Saad Eddin Ibrahim was arrested along with 27 employees of the  Center. Dr. Saad Eddin Ibrahim was charged under the Military Decree  No.4 of 1992, adopted within the framework of the State of Emergency  Law (1981) that prohibits the reception of foreign funds without  previous authorisation by the State, for having received funds from  the European Union without previous State authorization. He was also  charged with forgery of electoral cards, misappropriation of funds,  and disseminating false information abroad contrary to the interests  of Egypt.   He received a seven-year prison sentence by a State Security Court on  21 May 2001 along with his 27 co-defendants. He was then released on  7 February 2002 after the Court of Cassation broke the State Security  Court's decision and transferred the case to another Court. However  this new Court confirmed the sentence and he was again put in prison  on 22 July 2002, along with 3 co-defendants. He was finally released  upon a second decision of the Court of Cassation on 3rd December  2002, waiting for the final and definitive verdict pronounced today.  The Observatory sent observers to the different steps of the  proceedings. It considered that the charges brought against Dr.  Ibrahim were arbitrary, since they only aimed at sanctioning his  activity in favour of the defence of Human Rights and of democracy in  Egypt. This situation also raised grave concerns amongst national and  international human rights organisations, and was denounced by all  the actors of the international community, including the European  Union.   While welcoming this decision, the Observatory remains however  concerned about the legal provisions of the Egyptian legislation, as  regards freedom of association. The new law on associations adopted  in June 2002 is indeed very restrictive and includes the prohibition  to receive foreign funding without prior authorisation. These  restrictions are strengthened by the renewal of the State of  Emergency in February 2003 (and therefore of Military Decree No.4 of  1992) for a period of three years.  The Observatory therefore calls the Egyptian authorities to amend its  legislation so as to conform with international human rights  instruments ratified by Egypt as well as with the provisions of the  Declaration on Human Rights Defenders adopted by the UN General  Assembly in 1998.
