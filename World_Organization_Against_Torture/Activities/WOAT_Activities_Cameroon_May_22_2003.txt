Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT was informed by the Movement  for the Defence of Human Rights and Liberties (MDHRL) about the  neglect and maltreatment of "child-witches" in Cameroon. According to  the information received, "child-witches" were abandoned by their  parents placed in the care of the "Civic Re-education Centre" owned  by the Marabout Mal Bakary in the  Doualaré district in Maroua, where  they were maltreated and exploited. In fact, children in this centre  were forced, with chains at their feet, to break and pick up rocks in  the mountains many times per day and they suffered from maltreatment  performed on grounds of exorcism. Following their escape from the  centre during the night of  January 25th 2003, eight children were  found by their " master ", while five others were taken care of at  the MDHRL's headquarters, that is Hamadou Bachirou (12 years old),  Mohama Bladi (14 years old), Yaya Aboubakar (16 years old), Mouktar  Abba Boura (17 years old) et Ali Boukar (17 years old). The Attorney  General of  the  Republic has prosecuted the Marabout Mal Bakary, but  the situation remains unchanged and the children which were taken  back by the Centre still remain maltreated and exploited.     OMCT is very concerned about the fate of the eight children taken  back by their " master " and also about any other child who may  reside at the Centre. Moreover, OMCT is preoccupied by the lack of  adequate care for the five children who escaped and currently reside  at the MDDHL, and also by the lack of measures undertaken to  facilitate their return to their families. Finally, OMCT is alarmed  by the impunity of the Marabout Mal Bakary.   The phenomenon of the so-called " child-witches " is present  throughout Africa. It exists in Benin, in Nigeria, in Liberia, in  Angola, in South Africa and in Cameroon. In fact, difficult children  are sometimes considered by their parents or by their relatives as  having evil powers and they are then rejected, marginalized by the  society or placed in re-education centres. Some children end up in  police stations, in search of protection, while others are arrested  for theft or vagrancy.  The living conditions of these children are  precarious and they are often victims of abuse or maltreatment.   The International Secretariat of OMCT is alarmed by the problem of  the so-called " child-witches " in Africa and strongly supports the  principles contained in the Convention on the Rights of the Child  (signed and ratified by all African States), and particularly article  19 which requires that  "State Parties shall take all appropriate  legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to  protect the child from all forms of physical or mental violence,  injury or abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or  exploitation (…)" and article 39 which requires that "States Parties  shall take all appropriate measures to promote physical and  psychological recovery and social reintegration of a child victim of:  any form of neglect, exploitation, or abuse; torture or any other  form of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; or armed  conflicts."   OMCT recalls that the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of  the Child, ratified by Cameroon in 1997, contains article 21 which  requires that " States Parties (…) take all appropriate measures to  eliminate harmful social and cultural practices affecting the  welfare, dignity, normal growth and development of the child (…)."    Action requested   Please write to the authorities in Cameroon urging them to:  i.	intervene in the case of the five children residing at the MDHRL's  headquarters in order to provide them with shelter, health services  and adequate assistance in  view of their reintegration in families  and in society. ii.	free all children which are maltreated in the "Civic Re-education  Centre" owned by Mal Bakary and to ensure their social and family  reintegration. iii.	develop protection programmes for the so-called "child-witches"  in Cameroon. iv.	initiate judiciary proceedings against any person which commits  acts of torture, or cruel, inhuman and degrading treatments against  children on grounds of witchcraft.
