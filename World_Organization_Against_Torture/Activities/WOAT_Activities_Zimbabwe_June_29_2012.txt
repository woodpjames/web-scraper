Arbitrary arrests / Arbitrary detentions
Violations to freedom of peaceful assembly
Zimbabwe

The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights
Defenders, a joint programme of the International Federation for Human Rights
(FIDH) and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent
intervention in the following situation in Zimbabwe.
 
Description of the situation:
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources
about the repression of a peaceful demonstration organised by Women and Men of
Zimbabwe Arise (WOZA), a civic movement that defends women's rights and
freedoms in Zimbabwe. The clamp down led to the arrest and subsequent release of 101 of its
members, including Ms. Magodonga Mahlangu, one
of the leaders of WOZA.
 
According
to the information received, on June 27, 2012 in the morning, 101
members of WOZA were arrested in the centre of Bulawayo,
where protests were due to start at 11.00 a.m in ten different
locations. All were taken to Bulawayo Central Police Station, many of whom
handcuffed. Their lawyers were denied access to their clients on three
occasions.
 
The
101 were released without charges between 4.30 p.m. and 5.30 p.m. on the same day, in batches of 5 people so as to prevent any mass
protests. Ms. Magodonga Mahlangu was the last to be released at 5.30 p.m.
 
Previously,
on June
 26, 2012, eight members of the Zimbabwe
Human Rights Association (ZimRights) were also arrested in Bulawayo
as they were on their way back from a workshop to commemorate the 2012 United
Nations International Day in Respect of Victims of Torture. They were also
detained at Bulawayo Central Police Station for an hour, before being released
without charges.
 
On
the same day in Karoi, four other members of ZimRights were briefly detained
before being released without charges.
 
The Observatory expresses its deepest concern about
the increasing obstacles to freedom of assembly currently taking place in Zimbabwe.
 
The Observatory refers these cases to the United
Nations Special Rapporteurs on the situation of human rights defenders and on
freedoms of assembly and association.
 
Actions requested:
 
Please write to the authorities of Zimbabwe
asking them to:
 
i.        
Guarantee in all
circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Ms. Magodonga
Mahlangu, of the other WOZA and ZimRights members who were detained, as well as
all human rights defenders in the country;
 
ii.       Put an end to any kinds of harassment, including at the judicial level,
against WOZA and ZimRights members, as well as against all human rights
defenders in Zimbabwe; 
 
iii.      Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights
Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially:
1.      its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually
and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and
realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and
international levels”, 
2.      its Article 5 (a), which states that “everyone has the
2.right, individually and in association with others, at the national and
international levels (…) to meet or assemble
peacefully;
3.      and its Article
12.2, which provides that the State shall “take all necessary measures to
ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually
and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de
facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action
as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of his or her rights”; 
 
iv.     More generally, ensure in all circumstances the respect for human rights
and fundamental freedoms in accordance with in accordance with the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights and with international and regional human rights
instruments ratified by Zimbabwe.
