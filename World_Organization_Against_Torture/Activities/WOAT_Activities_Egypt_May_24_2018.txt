Abduction /
Incommunicado detention
Egypt
May 24, 2018
 
The Observatory for the Protection of
Human Rights Defenders, a partnership of FIDH and the World Organisation
Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent intervention in the following
situation in Egypt.
 
Description of the situation:
 
The
Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the abduction and
incommunicado detention of Mr. Wael
Abbas, journalist and human rights defender. He is the
author of the Misrdigital blog since
2006, in which he documents cases of corruption, harassment of women, police
brutality and discusses Egyptian society. 
 
According to the information received, on May 23, 2018 at 4:30 am, Mr.
Wael Abbas’ apartment was raided by heavily armed police personnel who did not
present any warrant. Mr. Wael Abbas posted a message on his Facebook account saying he was being
arrested. He was taken blindfolded to an unknown location after they seized
computers, telephones, some books and several other items that belong to him.
It is likely that Mr. Wael Abbas is detained in a state security facility. He
does not have access to his lawyer and family.
 
Although no official charges have been filed against him, a security
spokesman told the press that he would be accused of “joining a banned group”
and “publishing false news”.
 
This is not the first time that Mr. Wael Abbas is targeted by the
authorities for his human rights activities, as in the past years his Facebook account had been temporarily
taken down by Egyptian authorities, and his Twitter
account has been suspended since December 2017. In January 2018, Mr.
Wael Abbas reported that this suspension was
linked to accusations of being linked to ISIS pending against him.  
 
The Observatory strongly condemns the incommunicado detention of Mr.
Wael Abbas, which significantly enhances his vulnerability to ill-treatment, and
urges the Egyptian authorities to immediately disclose his whereabouts and
ensure he has unhindered access to his family and lawyers. 
 
The Observatory further urges the Egyptian authorities to immediately
and unconditionally release Mr. Wael Abbas as his detention is arbitrary and
clearly aims at punishing his peaceful and legitimate human rights activities.
 
The Observatory is particularly concerned as Mr. Wael Abbas is the third
human rights defenders to be arrested since May 11, 2018, as Ms. Amal Fathy[1]
and Mr. Haytham Mohamadein[2]
remain arbitrarily detained.
 
Actions requested:
 
Please
write to the authorities of Egypt asking them to:
 
i.       
Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and
psychological integrity of Messrs. Wael Abbas, Haytham
Mohamadein, Ms.
Amal Fathy and all human rights
defenders in Egypt;
 
ii.    Immediately and
unconditionally release Messrs. Wael Abbas, Haytham
Mohamadein, Ms.
Amal Fathy as their detention is
arbitrary and merely aimed at punishing them for their human rights activities;
 
iii.    Put an end to all acts
of harassment, including at the judicial level, Messrs.
Wael Abbas, Haytham Mohamadein, Ms. Amal Fathy and all human rights defenders in Egypt, and ensure that
they are able to carry out their activities without hindrance or fear of
reprisals; 
 
iv.    Conform with the
provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the
General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially Articles
1, 6(c) and 12.2; and
 
v.    More generally, ensure
in all circumstances the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in
accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with
international and regional human rights instruments ratified by Egypt.
