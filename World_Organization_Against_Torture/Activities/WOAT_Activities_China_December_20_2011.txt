Incommunicado detention / Health concern
People’s Republic of China
December 20, 2011
 
The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint 
programme of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World 
Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), has received new information and requests 
your urgent intervention on the following situation in the People’s Republic of China.
 
New information:
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the 
incommunicado detention of Mr. Gao Zhisheng, Director of the Beijing-based Shengzhi Law Office and a 
high-profile human rights defender in China, whose whereabouts have remained unknown since April 2010.
 
According to the information received, on December 16, 2011, a brief 
report by the State-run Xinhua News Agency stated that Mr. Gao Zhisheng had been "sent back to jail" by a 
Chinese court, six days before his five-year probation was due to expire (see 
background information). 
 
The whereabouts of Mr. Gao Zhisheng remain unknown, since the media 
report did not include any information about the jail to which he was sent. His 
health condition also remains unknown.
 
The Observatory strongly denounces the incommunicado detention of Mr. 
Gao Zhisheng, which merely aims at sanctioning his human rights activities, and 
fears for his health condition. Accordingly, the Observatory calls for his 
immediate and unconditional release.
 
Background information:
 
Mr. Gao Zhisheng, who has been under constant police surveillance, 
along with his family, since receiving a suspended sentence for “inciting 
subversion” in 2006, was last heard on April 20, 2010. He had only reappeared on March 28, 
2010 following a 14-month detention during which he had been subjected 
torture. The authorities subsequently denied that Mr. Gao was in custody and 
the police refused to register him as missing.
 
As a criminal defence lawyer, Mr. Gao has been involved in sensitive 
cases relative to human rights violations, such as torture of members of the 
Falun Gong and Christian house church leaders, as well as cases of arbitrary 
detention of petitioners seeking official accountability for acts of corruption 
and negligence.
 
Arrested without a warrant on August 15, 2006, Mr. Gao was sentenced 
on December 22, 2006 for “inciting the subversion of State power” to three 
year’s imprisonment, commuted into five years parole and to the privation of his 
political rights during one year. Following this sentencing, Mr. Gao was 
released and placed under house arrest.
 
On September 13, 2007, Mr. Gao wrote an open letter calling upon US 
Congressmen to express their concern about China’s human rights’ situation in 
the lead-up to the 2008 Olympic Games. On September 16, 2007, a group of police 
from the Security Unit of the Beijing Public Security Bureau (PSB) searched his 
flat and declared that a “supervision and modification” committee was to be 
formed in order to closely monitor his activities by requiring that some 
officials live in his flat for an undefined period. On September 22, 2007, Mr. 
Gao Zhisheng was driven away from his home by ten plainclothes State security 
protection officers. Early November 2007, Mr. Gao was brought back to his flat, 
in Beijing. He would have been beaten and subjected to ill-treatments while in 
detention.
 
Actions requested:
 
Please write to the authorities in the People’s Republic of China, 
urging them to:
 
i. Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological 
integrity of Mr. Gao Zhisheng;
 
ii. Disclose the whereabouts of Mr. Gao Zhisheng, and ensure his 
immediate release since his detention is arbitrary as it merely aims at 
sanctioning his human rights activities;
 
iii. Put an end to the harassment - including at the judicial level - 
against Mr. Gao Zhisheng as well as against all human rights defenders in the 
People’s Republic of China;
 
iv. Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights 
Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 
1998, especially its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, 
individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the 
protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the 
national and international levels”, and Article 12.2, which provides that “the 
State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the 
competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, 
against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse 
discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his 
or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present 
Declaration”;
 
v. Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and 
fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and 
international instruments ratified by the People’s Republic of 
China.
