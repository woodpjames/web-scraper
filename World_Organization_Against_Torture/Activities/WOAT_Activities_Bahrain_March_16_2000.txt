Brief description of the situation   The International Secretariat of OMCT has received information  from the Bahrain Human Rights Organisation, (BHRO), a  member of the network, regarding the arrest and arbitrary  detention of a number of children in February and March 2000.   According to the information received, the children include  Hassan Salman Al Laith, 16, Ali Ahmed Jaffar Al Laith,  16, Mohammed Hassan Maki, 16, Jaffar Mohammed  Abdul Rasul, 17 ( all were arrested on 10 March from Dar  Kulaib area), Hussain Ali Hassan Al Affia, 16 (arrested on  10 March from Shahrakkan area), Khadem Abdula Ali, 14,  Hussain Ahmed Abas, 14 and Hussain Ali, 14 (the latter  three were arrested on 7 March from Dair Area. They were  threatened and intimidated then released on the same day. They  had been arrested twice before and were accused of writing pro- democracy slogan).   On 20 February, one citizen, Ali Mansoor, 17, from Abo- Saiba, was snatched from his house.     These cases are part of the ongoing political unrest and the  widespread popular movement calling for political reforms and  the restoration of democracy.    On 26 August 1975, Amiri Act No. 14 was issued dissolving  the National Assembly. Subsequently, Amiri Act No. 4 /1975  was issued suspending Article 65 of the Constitution and other  articles relevant to the organization of parliamentary life. These  two Acts, which are still in force, constitute a violation of  Articles 65, 32/a, and 42 of the Constitution. The constitution  establishes that in such an event elections for a new assembly  must be held within two months. The ruling family has steadfastly  refused to do it, and this refusal is one major factor underlying  the current unrest.   These persons were arrested under the 1974 State Security  Law which allows for the detention of a person without charge  or trial for up to three years and sets a special court system "the  State Security Court", a procedure of which falls short of  International standards for fair trial.   The International Secretariat recalls that Bahrain is a party to the  Convention on the Rights of the Child and as such is obligated to  ensure the protection of all children against all forms of illegal or  arbitrary detention, as well as protect against torture, or other  cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.   Recalling previous appeals on Bahrain, involving frequent cases  of detention, OMCT is concerned about the physical and  psychological integrity of these persons.   Action requested   Please write to the authorities in Bahrain urging them to:   i.	take all necessary measures to guarantee the  physical and psychological integrity of the above- mentioned children and order their immediate  release in the absence of valid legal charges or, if  such charges exist, bring them before an impartial  and competent tribunal and guarantee their  procedural rights at  all times;   ii.	put an immediate end to the use of arbitrary or illegal  detention of children and abrogate 1974 State  Security Law and all national laws which are not in  compliance with international human rights standards;   iii.	guarantee the respect of human rights and the  fundamental freedoms throughout the country in  accordance with national laws and international  human rights standards, particularly the Convention  on the Rights of the Child.
