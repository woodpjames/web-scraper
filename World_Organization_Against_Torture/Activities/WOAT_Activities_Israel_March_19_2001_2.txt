Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel (PCATI), a member of the OMCT network, of the use of illegal methods of interrogation by General Security Service (GSS) interrogators in Israel.  According to the information received, GSS interrogators have allegedly tortured Mr Nasser Iyad during his detention in the interrogation units of the Ashkelon and the Petach Tikva detention centers. Mr Iyad, a 36 year old resident of Gaza suspected of security offenses, was arrested in the vicinity of Nesarim on January 29 2001 and is currently being held at the interrogation unit of the Ashkelon Detention Center.  According to sworn afidavits received through Iyad's lawyer, Nael Zahalke from the office of attorney Andre Rosenthal, illegal methods of interrogation had been employed against Iyad including: "Gambaz" sitting on a chair facing its back with his head hanging down to the floor for an extended period of time having been held down by one of the interrogators; choking; burns caused by a projector used for sleep prevention and to cause pain to the detainee's eyes; threats that the detainees father would be killed and notification that he was killed; intentional deprivation of food and drink; deprivation of sleep for 7 consecutive days; stamping on the detainee's foot manacles; slapping; intentional tightening of hand and foot manacles ; handcuffing to a chair and beatings.  The detailed description of the methods of interrogation and similar complaints received in recent months paint a dangerous picture of a return to the days before the 6.9.1999 High Court of Justice ruling prohibiting the use of torture during interrogation.   Action requested  Please write to the authorities in Israel urging them to:  1.	take all necessary measures to guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of Mr Nasser Iyad; 2.	order his immediate release in the absence of valid legal charges against him or, if such charges exist, bring him before an impartial and competent tribunal and guarantee his procedural rights at all times; 3.	guarantee an immediate investigation into the alleged torture of Nasser Iyad, identify those responsible, bring them before a civil competent and impartial tribunal and apply the penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions provided by law; 4.	ensure that Nasser Iyad receives appropriate medical assistance as a matter of urgency; 5.	guarantee full respect of the Israeli 6.9.1999 High Court of Justice ruling prohibiting the use of torture during interrogation as well as of the right not to be subjected to torture as guaranteed in the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment; 6.	in general guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
