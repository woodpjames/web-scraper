Niger: This 25 May
marks two months in detention of 26 activists and civil society members  
 10 organisations call on authorities to stop their prosecutions and
release them in order to ease the current tense situation  
 
 Two months after 26 civil society activists were arrested in peaceful
demonstrations against a new finance law in the capital, Niamey, Oxfam and Amnesty
International are joining with eight NGOs to call on the authorities of Niger
to ease the situation by releasing the detainees and bring an end to the prosecutions.
 
The civil society activists were indicted on March 25 2018 for
"organizing and participating in a prohibited demonstration",
"complicity in violence", "aggression" and
"destruction of property and are jailed in various prisons in the country.
The 26 arrested include three leaders of civil society organizations: Moussa
Tchangari, Alternative espace citoyen
(Alternative citizen spaces); Ali Idrissa, Rotab; and Nouhou Arzika, Mouvement pour la promotion de la
citoyenneté responsable (Movement for the Promotion of Responsible
Citizenship). Five other protesters including Ibrahim Diori (Alternative espace citoyen /Alternative
citizen spaces), Maïkoul Zodi (Tournons
la Page,) Abdourahamane Idé Hassane (Jeunesse
pour une mentalité nouvelle /Youth for a New Mentality) were later arrested
on April 15 and prosecuted for the same charges.
 
"This situation is of deep concern for international
human rights and development organizations who believe that widening the civic
space does not impinge on the government, but instead allow citizens to engage
in a constructive dialogue with the authorities,” said Adama Coulibaly, Oxfam West Africa Regional Director.  
"The right of civil society organizations to
engage in peaceful activities is protected by international law. These people
play a vital role in the protection and realization of human rights and
democracy. They should not be seen as a threat, but rather as actors of
dialogue with whom the State should engage . "
The organizations call on the authorities in Niger to release
immediately these activists and to put an end on procesutions against them. The
authorities should also enter without delay into a constructive dialogue with
civil society organizations about their right to protest on any matter of national
interest. 
"Instead of
deploying strategies to attack civil society activists and human rights defenders,
 the authorities in Niger should
recognize their legitimacy by respecting their work, providing them with the
necessary space for their activities, and protecting them against threats,”  said Samira
Daoud, Amnesty International Deputy
Regional Director  for  Wesst and Central Africa.
"In no case should Niger distinguish itself by
reducing the space of civil society in West Africa. It is high time to release
these detainees all arrested  in
connection with the 2018 finance law protests," said Melanie Sonhaye Kombate of the West African Human Rights Defenders
Network
