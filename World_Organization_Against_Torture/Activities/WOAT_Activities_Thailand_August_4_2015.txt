August 4, 2015
The Observatory for the Protection of Human
Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the World Organisation Against Torture
(OMCT) and the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) has received
new information and requests your urgent intervention
in the following situation in Thailand.
New information:
The Observatory has been informed by reliable
sources about a police summons issued against Mr. Baramee Chairat, a
coordinator of Thailand’s Assembly of the Poor, a grassroots people’s movement
that works for the protection and promotion of land rights.
According to the information received, on August
5, 2015 at 10.00 am, Mr. Baramee is due to report to the Samranrat Police
Station in Bangkok in response to a summons issued against him on July 3 on
charges of sedition under Article 116 of the Thai Criminal Code.
The summons does not provide any details
regarding the alleged actions that caused the summons. The Observatory fears
that authorities are targeting Mr. Baramee merely for observing a peaceful
protest held by 14 student activists at Bangkok’s Democracy Monument on June
25, 2015 (see background information), and providing accommodation for them.
The
Observatory expresses its deepest concern for the acts of judicial harassment
against Mr. Baramee as well as against the 14 students activists, as they seem
to only aim at sanctioning their legitimate human rights activities.
Accordingly,
the Observatory calls on the Thai authorities to put an end to any kind of
harassment against Mr. Baramee, refrain from threatening and harassing the 14
student activists, and repeal NCPO Order No. 3/2015, which
fails to comply with Thailand’s international legal obligations.
Background information:
On May 22,
2015, Thai police arrested student activists Messrs. Chatupat Boonyapatraksa,
Apiwat Suntararak, Payu Boonsopon, Panupong Srithananuwat,
Suvicha Tipangkorn, Supachai Pukrongploy, Wasant Sadesit,
who are also members of the Dao Din group, and Mr. Rangsiman Rome, Mr. Songtham
Kaewpanphruek, Mr. Rattapol Supasophon, Mr. Apisit Sapnapaphan,
Mr. Pakorn Areekul, Mr. Pornchai Yuanyee and Ms. Chonticha
Chaengreo, in connection with their participation into peaceful protests
held in Khon
Kaen and
in Bangkok to mark the first anniversary of the military coup.
On May 23,
2015, the seven students from Khon Kaen University were released on bail with charges by the Khon Kaen police of violating the Head of NCPO
Order No. 3/2015.
The seven student activists from various
universities in Bangkok, were also released without charges on the same date.
On June 24
and 25, 2015, the 14 student activists took part in peaceful rallies in Bangkok
calling for an end to military rule.
On June 26,
2015, police arrested the 14 student activists in execution of an arrest
warrant issued by the Bangkok Military Court related to the rally of June 25.
They were charged with violating National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO)
Order No. 3/2015 and Article 116 of the Thai Criminal Code (sedition).
At 0.30 am on June 27, 2015, the Bangkok
Military Court granted the remand in custody of the 14 student activists for 12
days. The 13 men were detained at the Bangkok Remand Prison and Ms. Chonticha Chaengreo was held at the Woman
Correctional Institution.
On July 7,
2015, the Bangkok Military Court rejected the police request for a 12-day
extension of the pre-trial detention of the 14 student activists. The student
activists were released without any conditions on the morning of July 8, 2015.
However, the
charges of violating
NCPO Order No. 3/2015, which bans gatherings of more than five people, and
Article 116 of the Thai Criminal Code (sedition)
have not been dropped. If found guilty of sedition, the student activists
could face up to seven years in prison. In addition, they face up to six months
in prison and a fine of up to 10,000 baht (EUR 282) if found guilty of
violating NCPO Order No. 3/2015.
