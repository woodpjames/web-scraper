At around 6:30 pm when they were returning to their hotel from Shailopropat Tourist Spot in a shared taxi, 8-10 people, led by BSOA leader HM Samrat, seized the taxi, pulled out two other passengers and  physically assaulted Hana and her friend, striking their faces and backs. According to Hana, the Detective Branch police who were ordered to provide her security were accompanying her all day; however, they disappeared during the time of the violent attack. The attackers stopped and left the two women after the group leader saw a local motorcyclist who recognised them.Hana Shams Ahmed has been a vocal advocate for women’s rights. The CHTC recently published a report on violence against indigenous women and girls in Chittagong Hill Tracts that found that impunity has been the single most important factor contributing to increased incidents of sexual and gender based violence in the CHT. Hana has also been active in the campaign for Kalpana Chakma, an indigenous women's rights activist who was abducted from her home in CHT in June 1996, allegedly by members of the Bangladesh Army.The Coalition notes with concern that this violent attack is part of a trend of increasing attacks on WHRDs due to the failure of authorities to take effective legal actions to protect human rights activists. CHTC members have been repeatedly targeted with intimidation and violence for carrying out their human rights work. Last month committee members of the CHTC were also attacked.We call on the Government of Bangladesh to:1.               Conduct  an immediate and transparent investigation into the attack on  Hana Shams Ahmed and bring all those responsible to justice;2.               Ensure the physical and psychological protection of the staff of CHTC and provide security to ensure they can continue their human rights work without constraint; and3.               Respect and protect human rights defenders and ensure they are able to conduct their legitimate work without fear of physical and psychological violence throughout Bangladesh. For more informationhttp://www.chtcommission.org/index.phphttp://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/2014/aug/26/cht-commission-official-injured-attackhttp://www.dhakatribune.com/law-rights/2014/aug/28/chtc-demands-probe-attack-officialNotes The Women Human Rights Defender International Coalition is a resource and advocacy network supporting women defenders worldwide.
