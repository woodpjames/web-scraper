Brief description of the situation:The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by ODHIKAR – A Coalition for Human Rights, member of the OMCT network, about the acid attack against Ms. Chandana Rani Mandol (32) at Outshahi village in Tongibari Upazila, Munshiganj district, Bangladesh.  According to the information received, on 11 February 2006, around midnight, a group of individuals – supposedly a gang – threw acid on Ms. Chandana Rani Mandol’s back as she was going to the toilet. She was rushed to Munshiganj hospital with severe acid burn and subsequently was shifted to the Acid Survivors Foundation (ASF), Dhaka, for better treatment.  After a case was filed with the Tongibari police station under the Acid Control Act, police arrested the wife and the brother of Mr. Monir Hossain, who lives in the same village, for their alleged involvement in the acid attack.  According to the information, Ms. Chandana Rani Mandol and her family have disputes with some of her neighbours, including Mr. Monir Hossain Sheikh, over a piece of land for the past four years. In particular, on 11 February 2006 at around 4.00 pm, a quarrel took place between Ms. Chandana Rani Mandol and both Mr. Monir Hossain’s wife and his brother regarding ongoing civil suits filed against each other (See Background information).  OMCT is concerned about the progress of the investigation into the acid attack against Ms. Chandana Rani Mando as the main accused persons are yet to be arrested.  OMCT recalls that the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women states in its article 4(c) that States should "exercise due diligence to prevent, investigate and, in accordance with national legislation, punish acts of violence against women, whether those acts are perpetrated by the State or by private persons." Background information:Two years ago, Ms. Chandana Rani Mando’s father-in-law Mr. Ramesh Kumar Mandol filed a case against Messrs. Monir Hossain and Amir Hossain who were trying to occupy the land where his family and relatives live. Since then they have been pressurising them to withdraw the case. The parties filed four cases so far over the land dispute. Out of these four cases three are pending in Munshiganj District Judge’s Court and one is pending in the High Court Division of the Supreme Court. Requested action:Please write to the authorities in Bangladesh urging them to: ensure Ms. Chandana Rani Mandol’s physical and psychological integrity, including her access to adequate medical treatment; i.	carry out a prompt, thorough and impartial investigation into the acid attack on Ms. Chandana Rani Mandol, in order to identify all those responsible and to bring them to justice and apply the penal and/or administrative sanctions as provided by law; ii.	more generally, ensure women the right to be free from discrimination, including violence, in line with the international laws and standards; iii.	guarantee the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
