Description of the situation: The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources of the attack upon the home of Mr. Sat Savuth, a well-known Cambodian human rights campaigner advocating land and forestry rights in Anlong Veng district’s Phat commune. According to the information received, on July 23, 2007, about 11:30 p.m., Mr. Savuth witnessed four assailants throw a home-made grenade at the front door of his home, in Oddar Meanchey province. Fortunately, Mr. Savuth and his family were not injured. Mr. Savuth has previously been the target of attacks relating to his denunciations of illegal logging. In 2005, he moved to Anlong province on the advice of human rights organisations for fear of his life after having been shot at by an unidentified gunman angered by his previous criticisms of government corruption in Tomring commune, Kampong Thom province. Mr. Savuth’s work on illegal logging in the Tomring commune appeared more recently in the report on Cambodia by environmental group Global Witness, entitled Cambodia’s Family Trees. This report has clearly upset the Cambodian Government, which has banned the publication and the diffusion of its contents in local print media[1]. Following these attacks against Mr. Savuth, local authorities have pledged to properly investigate this attack. However, as quoted in the Cambodia Daily on July 23, 2007, the Governor of Anlong Veng province would have already dismissed the idea that the attack was “politically motivated”. In view of the previous attempt to kill Mr. Savuth, the Observatory fears that the purpose of this recent attack was to kill him. This attack, which comes just weeks after the murder of another forestry and fisheries activist Mr. Seng Sarom, killed on July 4, 2007[2], confirms that human rights defenders in Cambodia are particularly at risk due to their efforts to help local communities protect their land and natural resources. The Observatory further recalls that according to the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on December 9, 1998, “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels” (Article 1) and that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration” (Article 12.2). Actions requested: Please write to the authorities in Cambodia urging them to:  Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of  Mr. Sat Savuth; Order a thorough and impartial investigation into the attack upon Mr. Sat Savuth, in order to identify those responsible, bring them to trial and apply the penal sanctions as provided by law; Put an end to all harassment against human rights defenders in Cambodia; Comply with the provisions of the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly on December 9, 1998, in particular the above-mentioned Articles 1 and 12(2); More generally, ensure in all circumstances the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with the international human rights instruments ratified by Cambodia.
