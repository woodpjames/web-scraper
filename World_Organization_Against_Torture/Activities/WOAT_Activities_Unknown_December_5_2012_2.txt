Forum on Business and Human Rights

Joint written intervention by the World Organisation Against Torture
(OMCT) and the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), in the
framework of their joint programme, the Observatory for the Protection of Human
Rights Defenders
 
December
4-5, 2012
 
The
World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and the International Federation for
Human Rights (FIDH), in the framework of the Observatory for the Protection of
Human Rights Defenders, welcome the opportunity to address the first annual UN
Forum on Business and Human Rights.
 
As
rightly pointed out by the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights Defenders, Ms.
Margaret Sekaggya, in a OHCHR press
release issued in April 2012 following the presentation of her last report to
the Human Rights Council, environmental and land rights defenders face a large
range of acts of criminalization and abuses when pointing out adverse impacts
of investment projects. Those include threats, violence, judicial harassment,
and even killings, as a consequence of their peaceful activities to defend the
right to live in a healthy environment, to protect natural resources and the
livelihood of their communities.
 
Theformer
Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General on Business and Human
Rights, Professor John Ruggie, also recommended
that 1) the legitimate and peaceful activities of human rights defenders should
not be obstructed, and2) that business enterprises, in their due diligence
efforts, should consult with “credible, independent resources including human
rights defenders”.
 
Humanrights
defenders, including those addressing environmental concerns, whose efforts
often intersect with both State and corporate activities, are at even greater
risk of business-related human rights abuses, as they often find themselves not
only vulnerable to abuses by State interests but also the interests of powerful
economic actors. Therefore, not only do States, including home governments of
corporations and host countries, have the responsibility to effectively protect
such defenders and fight against impunity for attacks and violations against
them, including by non-State actors, but enterprises also have the
responsibility to avoid any adverse impact of their activities
on
human rights defenders.
 
Accordingly,
the Observatory would like to make the following recommendations to this panel, audience and subsequent
readers of this comment:
 
1)
To States:
 
-      to
guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of all
human rights defenders, including those addressing land and environmental
concerns;
 
-      to
give full recognition to the legitimate role and important work they carry out
as well as to ensure that they are able to work effectively and without threat
of attack by State or non-State actors, including when they protest
against
adverse impact of investment projects on human rights;
 
-      to
combat impunity for attacks and violations against land and environmental human
rights defenders, committed both by State and non-State actors.
 
2)
To companies and multinational enterprises (MNEs):
 
-      to
respect the rights to freedoms of expression and assembly of those who speak out
or demonstrate against a company's activities; and refrain from retaliating (including
through litigation) against human rights defenders, including indigenous and
community leaders;
 
-      to
guarantee that human rights defenders, including indigenous and community
leaders, are adequately consulted and involved in decision-making process
related to the establishment of economic projects;
 
-      to
publicly support the legitimate activities of human rights defenders and speak
out to the relevant public authorities against restrictions on their
activities.
 
3)
To the UN Working Group on Business and Human Rights:
 
-      to
pressure States to fulfil their obligations to protect human rights defenders,
including those addressing land and environmental concerns, through tangible
measures and monitor the implementation of such measures;
 
-      to
take into account and to build on recommendations relating to the
criminalisation of activities of environmental and land human rights defenders
made by other UN procedures;
 
-      to
pay special attention to the actions of companies which contribute to the
criminalisation of the actions of human rights defenders.
