The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) has received new information and requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in Zimbabwe.
New information:
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the arbitrary arrest by a group of 20 officers of the Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) and subsequent release of Mr. Okay Machisa, Executive Director of the Zimbabwe Human Rights Association (ZIMRIGHTS).
According to the information received, on March 23, 2010, at 4 pm, Mr. Okay Machisa was arrested at the Gallery Delta of Harare, while he was checking on the preparation of a photo exhibition entitled “Reflections” scheduled to open on March 24, 2009. The exhibition is part of a national healing programme which aims at inciting reflections on the political violence that occurred in 2007. At around 3.45 pm, two truckloads of uniformed and plain clothes police had descended on the premises of the Gallery Delta in Central Harare and proceeded, without a warrant or justifiable cause, to remove the 65 photographs which formed the exhibition. During the raid, the 20 police officers acted in a threatening and intimidating manner towards Mr. Machisa, who was held in Harare Central Police Station, before being released at 6.30 pm, following the intervention of lawyers from Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights (ZLHR). The Officer Commanding Harare Central District advised that he had “not approved” the launch and gave Mr. Machisa seven days to provide “letters of consent from individuals and organisations” appearing in the photographs, failing which he threatened to launch unspecified criminal charges against Mr. Machisa.
On March 17 and 19, 2010, the police had interrogated Mr. Okay Machisa and Ms. Olivia Gumbo, ZIMRIGHTS National Programme Manager, about the objective and intents of the exhibition. On March 23, 2010, at 11am, the police took photos of the exhibition. Previously, ZIMRIGHTS had sent a notification letter for the exhibition to the police and had acquired an authorisation from the Harare High Court.
On March 24, 2010, at 3 pm, following an urgent chamber application filed by ZLHR's lawyers, the High Court ordered the police to return the photo exhibits to ZIMRIGHTS within an hour, with which the police complied.
The Observatory deeply condemns the arbitrary arrest of Mr. Okay Machisa and urges the Zimbabwe authorities to put an end to the continuing harassment against members of ZIMRIGHTS, which seem to merely aim at silencing them due to their human rights activities.
Background information:
On November 2009, several armed men waited at Mr. Machisa home’s gate as he returned from a meeting. They left after Mr. Machisa alerted the police and colleagues.
On February 16, 2010, Mr. Machisa received by email an anonymous message from a person identifying himself as Dzapasi Mumunda warning him to be careful with his work. The message said “Be careful my friend a number of people at my workplace have been assigned to bring you down. I refused to be involved. Be careful especially at your home”. 
On February 25, 2010, Messrs. Nunurai Jena, Netsai Kaitano and Jabilusa Tshuma and received different anonymous messages on their cell phones ordering them to put an end to their work on the constitution making process and threatening them with death. The messages also asked them about their motives to work within the association. All the messages were sent from the same number which is now unreachable. Mr. Okay Machisa also received a threatening message telling him to stay out of the country. The message said: “You enjoy flying in and out of the country demonizing your country, why don’t you go and stay there? They monitor, soon you will all stay out”. On March 2, 2010, ZIMRIGHTS filed a police report under number IR 030 117.
