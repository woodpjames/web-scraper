URGENT APPEAL - THE OBSERVATORY

Judicial harassment
Belarus
November 25, 2011
 
The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint 
programme of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World 
Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), has received new information and requests 
your urgent intervention in the following situation in 
Belarus.
 
New information:
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources of a new 
hearing planned for December 2, 2011 against Mr. Valiantsin Stefanovich, 
Vice-Chairman of the Human Rights Centre “Viasna”.
 
This case concerns the appeal lodged by Mr. Valiantsin Stefanovich 
against a ruling issued on October 19, 2011 requesting him to pay 4,727,330 Belarusian rubles 
(about 600 euros) in an administrative case opposing him to the tax inspection 
of Minsk Partyzanski District (see background information). Mr. Stepanovich was 
informed on November 23 of this next hearing date.
 
Another hearing already planned for December 2 concerns court 
proceedings aimed at collecting allegedly unpaid taxes, but also penalties, from 
Valiantsin Stefanovich.
 
Both hearings will be held at the Partyzanski district court 
of Minsk. 
 
The Observatory strongly denounces these acts of judicial harassment 
against Mr. Stefanovich, which seem to merely aim at sanctioning his human 
rights activities, and calls for the respect of fair trial standards at both 
hearings.
 
Background information:
 
On October 19, 2011, Mr. Stefanovich was requested to pay 
4,727,330 Belarusian rubles (about 600 euros) in the administrative case 
opposing him to the tax inspection of Minsk Partyzanski District. He was accused 
of having "understated the amount of his taxable income". Since the start of the 
proceedings, penalties have increased from 6 to 9 million rubles. The tax office 
wants him to pay 41 million rubles.
 
The Observatory recalls that the authorities have been hunting Mr. 
Valiantsin Stefanovich's resources over the past years. Since 2008, he has been 
asked on several occasions to provide his tax returns, including a tax form on 
the total income he received over 10 years (1998-2008), although he had already 
presented all those documents to the district tax 
inspection.
 
Actions requested :
 
Please write to the Belarusian authorities, urging them to 
:
 
i. Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological 
integrity of Mr. Valiantsin Stefanovich, as well as of all human rights defenders in 
Belarus;
 
ii. Put an end to any kind of harassment - including at the judicial 
level - against Mr. Valiantsin Stefanovich as well as against all other human 
rights defenders, and ensure his rights to a fair trial at both 
hearings;
 
iii. Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human 
Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 
December 9, 1998, especially:
- its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, 
individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the 
protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the 
national and international levels”,
- its Article 6 (b) and (c), which states that “Everyone has the 
right, individually and in association with others […] as provided for in human 
rights and other applicable international instruments, freely to publish, impart 
or disseminate to others views, information and knowledge on all human rights 
and fundamental freedoms and [...] to study, discuss, form and hold opinions on 
the observance, both in law and in practice, of all human rights and fundamental 
freedoms and, through these and other appropriate means, to draw public 
attention to those matters”.
- and its Article 12.2, which provides that “the State shall take all 
necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of 
everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, 
threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or 
any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of 
the rights referred to in the present Declaration” ;
 
Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental
