Lovemore Matombo and Wellington ChibebeNew information ZWE 002 / 0508 / OBS 075.2 Release on bail / Judicial proceedings Zimbabwe May 20, 2008 The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), has received new information and requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in Zimbabwe. New information: The Observatory has been informed by the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) about the release on bail of Messrs. Lovemore Matombo and Wellington Chibebe, respectively President and Secretary General of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU). According to the information received, on May 19, 2008, Zimbabwean High Court Judge Justice Ben Hlatshwayo released Messrs. Matombo and Chibebe on bail, for an amount of Z$20 billion each. They are facing charges of “inciting the public to rise against the Government and communicating falsehoods”, after they told workers gathered at Dzivaresekwa Stadium, on May 1, 2008, that people were being killed during the current wave of political violence in the country (See background information). However, as part of the conditions for granting bail, Justice Hlatshwayo said that the two were being forbidden to “address any political gathering until this matter is finalised”. They were also ordered to reside at their given home addresses and not to “interfere” with any State witnesses. The High Court Judge had heard the bail application on May 16, 2008, but deferred the verdict to May 19, 2008. The Observatory welcomes the release on bail of Messrs. Lovemore Matombo and Wellington Chibebe and wishes to thank all the persons, organisations, and institutions that intervened in their favour. Nevertheless, the Observatory expresses its concern at the conditions that were imposed on Messrs. Matombo and Chibebe’s release on bail. The Observatory further recalls that according to Article 1 of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”. Background information: On May 8, 2008, Messrs. Lovemore Motombo and Wellington Chibebe were both arrested in connection with May Day speeches, during which they spoke about the political crisis due to long postponement in the announcement of the election results and the ensuing wave of violent intimidation of opposition supporters. The police had been looking for them since then and on May 6, 2008, heavily armed police came to their homes. On May 7, 2008, they reported to the police station but were not taken in before the day after. They were charged with “inciting people to rise against the Government and reporting falsehoods about people being killed”. Subsequently, Messrs. Wellington Chibebe and Lovemore Matombo were refused bail despite the fact that they went willingly to the police station for questioning. According to the court order, they were supposed to remain in custody until May 23, 2008. Both men were then held at the Harare Remand Prison. On May 16, 2008, Mr. Raymond Majongwe, General Secretary of the Progressive Teachers’ Union of Zimbabwe (PTUZ) and a member of the General Council of the ZCTU, was apprehended by the police at the High Court of Zimbabwe in Harare while he was attending the bail hearing of Messrs. Matombo and Chibebe. He was later released without charge. Furthermore, the Observatory was informed that the High Court of Zimbabwe chose to reserve its judgment on the request of the two ZCTU leaders to post bail. Justice Ben Hlatshwayo said he needed time to weigh the need to protect the liberty of the accused and the protection of public order and safety and reserved judgment until May 19, 2008. Actions required: Please write to the authorities of Zimbabwe urging them to:   Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Messrs. Raymond Majongwe, Lovemore Motombo and Wellington Chibebe;  Put an end to all acts of harassment, including at the judicial level, against Messrs. Lovemore Motombo and Wellington Chibebe as well as against all human rights defenders in Zimbabwe;  Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its above-mentioned Article 1 and article 12.2, which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the [...] Declaration”;  Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by Zimbabwe.
