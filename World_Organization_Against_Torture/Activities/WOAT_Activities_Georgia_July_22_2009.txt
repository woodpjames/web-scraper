Brief description of the situation The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Human Rights Center (HRIDC), a member of OMCT SOS Network, about the denial of due process to Mr. Vakhtang Maisaia, a political scientist and military expert, who was arrested for espionage on 5 May 2009, and who is currently detained in Gldani Prison #8 in Tbilisi. OMCT fears that Mr. Maisaia may be at risk of torture and other ill-treatment. According to the information received, while Mr. Vakhtang Maisaia has had access to his lawyer since his arrest, the interrogation sessions have repeatedly taken place during night hours without the presence of his lawyer. In addition, Mr. Vakhtang Maisaia’s lawyer was reportedly only able to have access to his client’s case file on 17 May 2009 and then merely in a restricted way. According to the same information, during his interrogation at the Counter Intelligence Department, Mr. Vakhtang Maisaia was intimidated and threatened with physical violence, following which he allegedly signed a statement in which he pleads guilty as well as provides the names of two other individuals. Mr. Vakhtang Maisaia had later reportedly to confirm this statement while being again threatened with violence. He was further requested to collaborate with the Counter Intelligence Department failing which he would be sent to jail in harsh conditions. Mr. Vakhtang Maisaia reportedly refused such collaboration. OMCT is concerned for the safety of Mr. Vakhtang Maisaia and urges the authorities of Georgia to guarantee his physical and psychological integrity at all times in accordance with regional and international human rights law, in particular the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights, the UN Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). OMCT is further concerned that the authorities do not respect the rights of Mr. Vakhtang Maisaia guaranteed by the law of Georgia and international human rights standards.
