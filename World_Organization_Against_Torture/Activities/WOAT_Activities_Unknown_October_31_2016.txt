Geneva - Caracas, 31 October 2016 – Amidst a deepening political, social and economic
crisis, Venezuela’s human rights record will be scrutinized tomorrow for the second
time in the framework of the 26th session of the Universal Periodic
Review (UPR) Working Group.
This examination comes right when a number of human rights
organizations, including the World Organization Against Torture (OMCT) and COFAVIC, are
denouncing growing restrictions on individual and collective rights in the
country.
Tensions have risen a notch higher throughout Venezuela since the Government
declared the state of emergency on 13 May 2016, granting sweeping powers to the Executive, and blocked on 20 October 2016 the opposition’s signature
drive for a referendum to recall President Nicolás Maduro.   
On 26 October 2016, opposition-led rallies against the impeachment’s
suspension were met with excessive use of force by law enforcement and
pro-Government armed groups, with dozens of injured and 97 persons detained,
according to the Prosecutor’s Office. In 2014, following the protests that took
place from February to June, leaving 43 people dead and 878 injured, the
Committee Against Torture (CAT) said it was alarmed by “consistent reports of
acts of torture and ill-treatment inflicted on persons arrested during the
demonstrations, with acts including beatings, electric shocks, burns, choking,
sexual assaults and threats”. 
In light of this context and ahead of the upcoming UPR of Venezuela,
OMCT and COFAVIC submitted a joint report presenting key human rights concerns in the country. In particular, the
report highlights the current militarization of law enforcement, as obvious in
security operations such as the OLP, or “Operación Liberación y Protección del
Pueblo”, and regulations such as Resolution No. 8610, allowing the use of lethal
weapons to control protests; the increase of extrajudicial killings and
arbitrary arrests; as well as the total absence of convictions of
law-enforcement agents following acts of torture and ill-treatment committed in
the framework of the 2014 protests.
Among the recommendations set out in the
joint report, OMCT and COFAVIC call on UN Member States to urge Venezuela to:
- ensure that any allegations of torture, ill-treatment and
extrajudicial killing by law enforcement officers are investigated ex officio
in a prompt, thorough and impartial manner and the alleged perpetrators are
prosecuted, tried and punish with sentences commensurate with the gravity of
their acts;
- guarantee that the law enforcement bodies and related agencies working
on public safety have a strictly civilian and professional character at all
levels, as stipulated in article 332 of the State party’s Constitution, and
amend any legislation, regulations and plans that authorize the participation
of the military in the maintenance of public order, including the OLP and the Resolution
No. 8610; 
- remove barriers that facilitate impunity including the concealment of
the identity of law enforcement officers, the criminalization and
trivialization of victims and the modification of police reports;
- ensure that no individual or group is publicly discredited, threatened
or subjected to physical or other abuse for carrying out human rights work
including vis-à-vis the UN human rights bodies and the Inter-American Human
Rights System;
- ensure that all obstacles to women’s access to justice and protection
from violence are removed, strengthening the special courts dealing with
violence against women and ensuring victims’ access to protection measures
including shelters;
- ratify the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention Against Torture,
Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment;
- cooperate fully with UN Treaty Bodies, in particular the CAT, in the
implementation of their recommendations and decisions, and with Special
procedures, allowing outstanding requests for visits and encouraging the issuance
of standing invitations.
