Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by Al-Haq, a member of the OMCT network, of fears for the integrity of political prisoner Mr. Nasser Abu Khder in Israel. One month after his arrest by the Israeli Police on 21 February, 2001, Mr. Khder was transferred from Moscobia detention centre (Jerusalem) to Nafha prison (Negev), where he is being held in solitary confinement.  According to the information received, the Israeli authorities have so far prevented Mr. Khder’s wife from visiting him, although they did permit his children to see their father. According to his children, Khder told them that his life is in danger. Al-Haq reported that it is unsure at this moment what this means and is acutely concerned about Mr. Khder’s circumstances of confinement, particularly given that he suffers from a medical condition.  OMCT is gravely concerned about Mr. Khder’s physical and psychological integrity and his access to both medical treatment and his family.  Action requested  Please write to the authorities in Israel urging them to:  1.	take all necessary measures to guarantee Mr. Khder’s physical and psychological integrity; 2.	intervene with the appropriate authorities in order to secure that he be allowed to meet with his relatives and lawyer; 3.	intervene with the appropriate authorities in order to secure that the adequate medical assistance is provided as a matter of urgency to Mr. Khder; 4.	guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
