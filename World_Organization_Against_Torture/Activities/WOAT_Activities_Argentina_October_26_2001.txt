Description of the facts :  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by a reliable source that a peaceful demonstration by children of the Mapuche community was brutally repressed by riot police.  On 12 October 2001 some thirty policemen attacked about thirty children aged 6 to 17, to prevent them from painting slogans on the walls of the REPSOL-YPF petroleum company in Neuquén.  During the clashes which followed, several children were beaten with sticks and punched.  The children wanted to protest against the gradual contamination of the water tables in their region, which in turn was poisoning the Mapuche community.  The Mapuche community is settled in the Loma de la Lata zone.  This region contains the most important gas and petroleum deposits in South America.  According to information received, the REPSOL-YPF company which is exploiting these resources, is allegedly responsible for the contamination.  A study carried out by the under-secretary for Health in Neuquén indicates that the Mapuche living in the Loma de la Lata region, and particularly children and elderly people, are the victims of the high concentration of heaving metal, mainly lead, in their blood and their urine.  This is allegedly due to the fact that drinking water, plant matter and animals are all contaminated. According to information received, the children suffer problems of concentration, progressive loss of eyesight, painful joints and kidney complaints.  To fight against this problem, the Argentine justice system has ordered the Neuquén government to provide a daily supply of 250 litres of non contaminated water to each member of the community.  According to the information we have received, in actual fact they never receive they full entitlement of water.  The International Secretariat of OMCT expresses its deep concern about the situation of the Mapuche children, especially about their health and their physical integrity.  OMCT draws attention to the fact that by ratifying the Convention on the rights of the child, Argentina has recognised that "every child has an inherent right to life" and in particular, has undertaken "to ensure to the maximum extent possible the survival and development of the child." (Article 6).  Furthermore, Argentina has also recognised "the right of the child to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health and to facilities for the treatment of illness and rehabilitation of health" (Article 24 (1)).  Finally, according to Article 37, Argentina is bound to ensure that "no child shall be subjected to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment".  The International Secretariat of OMCT wishes to remind Argentina that in ratifying the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, it has also recognised "the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health".  To this end, Argentina has, in particular, given an undertaking to adopt the necessary steps for “the provision (…) for the healthy development of the child” (Article 12).  Action requested  We request you kindly to write to the Authorities in Argentina, urging them:  1.	to take all the necessary measures so as to guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of the Mapuche children;  ii.	to take all the necessary measures so that the Mapuche children enjoy a state of health that guarantees their survival and development;  iii.	to ensure that the rights contained in the Convention on the rights of the child are applied without discrimination against the Mapuche children  iv.	in general, to guarantee respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms in compliance with national laws and international standards, and particularly with the Convention on the rights of the child.
