The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of
the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and the International Federation
for Human Rights (FIDH), requests your urgent intervention in the following
situation in Cambodia.
 
Brief
description of the information:
 
The
Observatory has been informed by the Cambodian Center for Human Rights (CCHR) about
the arbitrary detention and judicial harassment of Mr. Ven Vorn, an Areng Valley environmental
activist and a community leader for the indigenous Chong minority in Koh Kong Province. 
According
to the information received, on October 7, 2015, at around
12.20pm, Mr. Ven Vorn was arrested and sent to Koh Kong provincial prison. The
arrest followed the decision of Investigating Judge Mr. Min Makara, who had
questioned Mr. Ven Vorn the same morning and charged him with “harvesting
timber products and/or non-timber forest products without a permit” (Article 98
of the Forestry Law) and “destruction of evidence” (Article 533 of the Criminal
Code). 
 
Both of
these charges relate to the construction by Mr. Vorn and a group of local
activists of a small visitor centre and community meeting place for local
activists involved in a campaign against the proposed construction of a hydropower
dam in the Areng Valley. The hydropower dam poses a threat to their land,
livelihood and the natural environment. For this project, Mr. Vorn and others
had purchased approximately 10 cubic metres of wood from a vendor in 2014, which
authorities claimed had been procured by the vendor through illegal logging.
 
On April 3,
2015, Mr. Ven Vorn was questioned at the Koh Kong provincial court in relation
to the same alleged illegal logging incident before being released on the same
day.
 
As of the issuing
of this Urgent Appeal, Mr. Ven Vorn remains in detention in Koh Kong provincial
prison.
 
Mr. Ven Vorn
has been targeted by the authorities in the past due to his human rights
activities. On September 2, 2015, he was among 17 people arrested outside Koh
Kong provincial court, where he was protesting for the release of three jailed
activists from the environmental NGO Mother Nature, namely Messrs. Sim Samnang, Tri Sovichea and Sun Mala,
who had also been involved in protests against the hydroelectric dam. They have
been charged with “threatening to destroy dredging barges”, and have been in
detention since August 17, 2015 in Koh Kong provincial prison.
 
The
Observatory strongly condemns the arbitrary detention of and judicial
harassment against Mr. Ven Vorn,
which only aims at sanctioning his legitimate human rights activities, and
calls on the Cambodian authorities to release him
immediately and unconditionally.
 
Actions
requested:
 
Please write
to the authorities of the Kingdom of Cambodia asking them to:
 
i. Guarantee
in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Messrs. Ven
Vorn, Sim Samnang, Tri Sovichea, and
Sun Mala as well as of all human rights defenders in Cambodia;
 
ii. Release Messrs. Ven Vorn, Sim Samnang, Tri Sovichea
and Sun Mala immediately and unconditionally since
their detention is arbitrary as it only aims at curtailing their human rights
activities;
 
iii.
Put an end to all forms of harassment, including at the judicial level,
against Messrs. Ven Vorn, Sim Samnang, Tri Sovichea and Sun Mala as well as of
all human rights defenders in the country so that they are able to carry out
their work without hindrance;
 
iv. Comply
with all the provisions of the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights
Defenders, adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 9, 1998, in
particular with its:
-       
Article 1, which states
that "everyone has the right, individually or collectively, to promote the
protection and fulfilment of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the
national and international levels", 
-       
as well as Article 12.2,
which provides that "the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure
the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually or in
association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto
or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a
consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the
present Declaration";
 
v. Guarantee
the respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with the
Universal Declaration on Human Rights and other international human rights
instruments signed or ratified by the Kingdom of Cambodia.
