The Observatory for the Protection of
Human Rights Defenders, a partnership of the World Organisation Against Torture
(OMCT) and FIDH, requests your urgent intervention in the following situation
in India.
 
Brief description of the situation:
 
The Observatory has been informed by
reliable sources about acts of intimidation and harassment against Ms. Salima Memcha, Thoubal District
Coordinator of the Extrajudicial Execution Victims’ Families Association, Manipur
(EEVFAM).
 
According to the information received, on April 7,
2018, at around 5am, a team of the Manipur police commando knocked loudly at
Ms. Salima Memcha’s gate. When she enquired about the reason for their visit, the
police unit gave no explanation and instead rushed inside her house, searching
every room and destroying personal property. One police officer reportedly threatened her, saying that “she
was the one they have been looking for months”. They also asked her information
about her family members, including her children. The search lasted about 30
minutes, after which police officers left the house. Before leaving, one of the
police officers took a picture of Ms. Memcha and threatened her with “dire
consequences”.
 
On the same day,
Ms. Memcha submitted a memorandum to the Director General of Manipur police,
asking for protection and his urgent intervention through the registration of a
First Information Report (FIR) against the police team involved in the raid on
her home.
 
Ms. Memcha was due to visit the Police Crime Investigation
Department (CID) branch office at Imphal that day, in connection with the case
of her husband, who was killed in an alleged encounter with Assam Rifles, an
Indian paramilitary force. Her husband’s case is part of 62 cases submitted by EEVFAM to the Supreme Court along with Writ Petition (Criminal) 129 of 2012[1]. However, due to concerns about her safety, Ms.
Memcha did not attend the meeting.
 
The
Observatory recalls that there have been other
recent incidents of violence, harassment, intimidation, and threats against
human rights defenders in Manipur by police and armed forces, including against
a member of EEVFAM and a legal representative of many of the victims involved
in EEVFAM’s 2012 petition to the Supreme Court of India, as well as against Ms. Ranjeeta
Sadokpam, a researcher with Human Rights Alert (HRA)[2].
 
The
Observatory strongly condemns the acts of harassment, intimidation, and threats
against Ms. Salima Memcha, which seem to be aimed at punishing
her for her peaceful and legitimate human rights activities as EEVFAM Thoubal District Coordinator.
 
The Observatory calls upon the Indian authorities to
put an end to all acts of harassment and intimidation against Ms. Salima Memcha, her family members, and all human
rights defenders who support the EEVFAM petition, and to undertake a prompt,
thorough and impartial investigation in the above-mentioned events.
 
Actions requested: 
 
Please write to
the authorities in India, urging them to:
 
i. Guarantee, in all circumstances, the
physical and psychological integrity of Ms. Salima Memcha, her family, and all
human rights defenders in India;
 
ii. Put an end to any
harassment against all human rights defenders in India, and ensure in all circumstances
that they are able to carry out their legitimate activities without any
hindrance and fear of reprisals;
 
iii. Conduct a prompt, independent, and thorough
investigation on the aforementioned acts of harassment and intimidation against
Ms. Salima Memcha in order to identify the
perpetrators, bring them before an independent tribunal, and sanction them as
provided by the law;
 
iv. Repeal the Armed Forces
Special Powers Act (AFSPA) without further delay;
 
v. Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration
on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United
Nations on December 9, 1998, in particular with Articles 1 and 12.2;
 
vi. Ensure in all circumstances respect for human
rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights
standards and international instruments ratified by India.
