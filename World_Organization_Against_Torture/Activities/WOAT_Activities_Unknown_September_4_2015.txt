Confronted with these challenges, and with a view to effectively address them, the report articulates a clear ask on the Commission to develop an internal fundamental rights strategy, in cooperation with the other institutions and in consultation with civil society (paragraphs 4 and 10). This overarching call encompasses and complements constructive recommendations relating to the use of existing fundamental rights and rule of law instruments (para. 8, 9, 11 and 12).Such leadership and recommendations from the European Parliament are extremely useful contributions to the ongoing institutional debates, at a time where political will, together with strategic thinking and effective action, are needed more than ever to ensure that the EU delivers on its promise to enforce respect for human rights and the rule of law at home, as well as abroad.The calls are consistent with, and reinforce previous calls made by the European Parliament, with the support of the EU Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA), the Council of Europe and civil society.We count on you to follow the steps of the LIBE Committee and endorse the Ferrara report. A strong and united parliamentary position is essential to sustain effective institutional models that can deliver on human rights at EU level.The European Parliament must continue to hold EU institutions and member states to account for their record on human rights. It must stand firm on its positions and remain a driving force for concerted and proactive EU action on human rights and the rule of law. Our organisations stand ready to assist with this task and will continue to push together for the development of an EU internal human rights strategy to guide this work.Yours sincerely,The Human Rights and Democracy Network (HRDN) working group on EU internal human rights policy,Amnesty InternationalAssociation pour la Prévention de la Torture (APT)CBMChurch and Society Commission of the CECCoalition for the ICC (CICC)European Network Against Racism (ENAR)Fédération Internationale de l’Action des Chrétiens pour l’Abolition de la Torture (FIACAT)FIDH (International Federation for Human Rights)Human Rights Watch (HRW)ILGA-Europe - the European Region of the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA)International Commission of Jurists (ICJ)International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims (IRCT)Open Society European Policy Institute (OSEPI)Quaker Council for European Affairs (QCEA)Terre des Hommes International Federation (TDHIF)Save the ChildrenSocial PlatformWorld Organisation Against Torture (OMCT)For further information, please contact:Natacha KazatchkineOpen Society European Policy InstituteCoordinator of the HRDN working group on EU internal human rights policyEmail: Natacha.kazatchkine@opensocietyfoundations.orgTel: 0032 25054644Visit the HRDN website: http://www.hrdn.euNote: This message was sent by E-mail from OSEPI on 3rd September 2015.
