New Information:  The Observatory has been informed by the Sudan Organization Against Torture (SOAT) of the arrest of Mr. Madawi Ibrahim Adam, Chairperson of the Sudan Social Development Organization (SUDO), a locally registered NGO created to promote sustainable development and human rights, which has been active in Darfur carrying out various workshops and providing assistance to internally displaced persons.  According to the information received, at 2 a.m. on January 24, 2005, Mr. Madawi was arrested at his family home in Kondoua village, North Kordofan, along with his friend, Mr. Salah Mohammed Abdalrahman, who was then visiting him. They were initially detained at the security forces headquarters in Umm Ruwaba city, where Mr. Madawi was reportedly interrogated. At 11 a.m., they were both transferred to the security forces offices in Al-Obied.  Moreover, according to SOAT, there has been no clarification on the motives of their detention, nor have they been charged with any offence so far.   The Observatory is deeply concerned by this new arbitrary detention of Mr. Madawi, which seems to be in connection with his activities in defence of human rights, and expresses its grave concern over the respect of his physical and psychological integrity, as well as that of Mr. Abdaldahman.   Background information:  Mr. Madawi Ibrahim Adam had been arrested on December 28, 2003, by the National Security Agency (NSA) at his house, in Omdurman, which was searched and allegedly damaged. Some documents were seized, in particular a project for the development of water stations in South Sudan. Mr. Madawi was then taken to his office in Khartoum, which was also searched, and his computer and other items were confiscated. Mr. Madawi remained in detention at an unknown location until information was given on January 3, 2004, on his transfer to Kober Prison. (See Observatory Urgent Appeal SDN 001 / 0104 / OBS 001).  On February 11, 2004, he was charged with crimes under the 1991 Sudanese Penal Code for undermining the constitutional system (article 50) and waging war against the State (article 51). All charges against him were dropped on August 4, 2004 and he was released on August 7.  The Observatory fears that these events were linked with the activities of SUDO. Indeed, one day prior to his arrest, Mr. Madawi had conducted a workshop on human rights education in Shendi. Also, on May 5, 2004, security forces in Zalingy arrested and detained another human rights activist of SUDO, Mr. Osman Adam Abdel Mawla, who works at the organisation’s Nyala branch (See Observatory Urgent Appeal SDN 003 / 0504 / OBS 035).   Action requested: Please write to the authorities of Sudan urging them to: i. guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Messrs. Madawi Ibrahim Adam and Salah Mohammed Abdalrahman, as well as that of all members of SUDO and human rights defenders in the country as a whole, and put an end to all acts of harassment against them;  ii. release Messrs. Madawi and Salah immediately, in the absence of any valid charges against them;  iii. conform with the provisions of the Declaration on Humans Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, in particular article 1, which states that "everyone has the right, individually or in association with others, to promote the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels"; article 12.2 which provides that "the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually or in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration.";  iv. ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in Sudan in accordance with international human rights standards.
