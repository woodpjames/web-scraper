AUDIO-VISUAL
TESTIMONIES - THE OBSERVATORY

 
Paris-Geneva, June 14, 2011. The Observatory for the Protection
of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the International Federation
for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT),
releases today a series of video testimonies on the situation of human rights
defenders in Belarus, Colombia, Kyrgyzstan, Turkey and the Democratic Republic
of Congo (DRC).
Harassment, arbitrary arrests and detentions, acts of
torture and ill-treatment, threats, etc. In 2011, a number of human rights
defenders are still facing serious hindrances to their activities.

The Observatory is developing audio-visual testimonies as a new tool to widen
the mobilisation on some specific cases, and to increase impact on the media
and public opinion. This new tool, more dynamic and “visually expressive”, also
aims at increasing the awareness of activists, national authorities, national,
regional and international institutions and agencies and their mechanisms.

situation of human rights defenders in Belarus, Colombia, Kyrgyzstan, Turkey

"Since its creation in
1997, the Observatory has not only been protecting human rights voices, it has
also aimed at bringing their messages to a wider audience. Such video
testimonies contain concrete recommendations to national authorities and the
international community that should be considered with utmost importance by the
authorities concerned and, more widely, by all "actors of change"",
FIDH President Souhayr Belhassen said today.
“Those testimonies from Belarus,
Colombia, Kyrgyzstan, Turkey and the DRC remind us that human rights defenders
from all over the world continue to face reprisals because of their vital work
to defend and protect human rights, and that we need to stay more vigilant than
ever to ensure they are able to carry out their peaceful activities without
hindrances and they remain a rampart against
arbitrariness and abuses”, added Eric Sottas, OMCT Secretary General.
