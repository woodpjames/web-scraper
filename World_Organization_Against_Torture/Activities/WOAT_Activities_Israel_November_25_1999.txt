Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat has been informed, by a reliable source, of the detention of Su'ad Hilmi Ghazal, 16 since her arrest by Israeli soldiers on December 13, 1998.     She was arrested, following a claim by a female settler from Shavei Shomron that Su'ad had tried to stab her.  She was subsequently taken to Kedumim settlement where she was allegedly beaten by Israeli settlers.  From there, she was taken to Ramle prison where she was interrogated and tortured.  She was held incommunicado for 27 days, 17 of which were in solitary confinement.  Following repeated appeals from the Palestinian Red Crescent, her family was able to visit her.  According to the information, Su'ad's lawyer, Khaled Quzmar, last visited her on November 4.  He reported that she has problems with her kidneys and has lost weight.  She has also gone on hunger strike in protest, for at least one month, accepting only one meal a day from her captors.
