New information:   The Observatory has been informed of some threats against the members of the Bahrain Center for Human Rights (BCHR), from the Bahraini authorities.  On September 30, 2004, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, Mr. Majeed Al-Alawi, in a statement published in Al-Wasat, a Bahraini newspaper, threatened the BCHR and its members, especially its president, Mr. Nabeel Rajab, to take punitive actions against the board members of the organization, if they would keep trying to breach the Ministry’s order of dissolution of the BCHR, campaigning for its rehabilitation and the release of its executive director, Mr. Al-khawaja, by corresponding with the media or other NGOs abroad.  Moreover, Mr. Al-Alawi declared that Mr. Nabeel Rajab was “sending messages abroad to create a chaotic atmosphere”, concerning the international campaign  the BCHR launched against its arbitrary dissolution and the arrest of Mr Al-Khawaja   Reminder of the facts :  On September 29, 2004, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, Mr. Majeed Al-Alawi, declared in a press release that he had issued an order of dissolution of the BCHR the night before, the order coming into force that same day. The official motive behind this decision is that the BCHR would have violated Law No. 21 of 1989 on Societies, without any other precision.   Moreover, the BCHR’s executive director, Mr. Abdul-Hadi Al-Khawaja, was arrested on September 26, 2004, after he had criticized the government’s policy during a symposium on economic rights in Bahrain, organized by BCHR on September 24. He was charged for « encouraging hate of the state » and « distributing falseness and rumors » on the basis of articles 165 and 168 of the Bahraini penal code and remanded in custody for 45 days in Howdh Aljaf detention center.   Following the symposium, a Committee composed of different governmental institutions was also created on September 26, by Mr. Al- Alawi, with the aim of « taking punitive and legal actions against the BCHR ».  The Observatory is very preoccupied by these threats, which constitute an intolerable step in the repression of human rights defenders activities, and in the denial of human rights and fundamental freedoms.  The Observatory is very concerned for the physical and psychological integrity of the Bahrain Center for Human Rights’ members, especially concerning Mr. Nabeel Rajab, as far as the Bahraini authorities could arrest him arbitrarily at any time.   Action requested:  Please write to the authorities of the Kingdom Bahrain urging them to:   i. Guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of the Bahrain Center for Human Rights’ members, and especially Mr Nabeel Rajab;  ii. release Mr. Al-Khawaja immediately and unconditionally and drop the charges against him, his detention and the charges against him being arbitrary;  iii. Rehabilitate the Bahrain Center for Human Rights (BCHR) and put an immediate end to any obstacles to its activities;  iv. Conform with the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders adopted by the UN General Assembly on 9 December 1998, in particular article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually or in association with others, to promote the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels,” and article 5(b), stating that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, at the national and international levels to form, join and participate in non-governmental organizations, associations or groups;”  v. Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with the Declaration and all other international human rights standards.
