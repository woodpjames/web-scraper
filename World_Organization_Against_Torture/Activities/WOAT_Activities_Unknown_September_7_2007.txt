According to the information received, on September 3, 2007, the wife of Mr. Mansour Osanloo, Ms. Parvaneh Osanloo, and his sister were briefly arrested in Tehran after they attempted to meet with Ms. Louise Arbour, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, who was at the time visiting Iran. They wanted to highlight the case of their husband and brother to the High Commissioner. Indeed, after talking with Ms. Shirin Ebadi, 2003 Nobel peace prize winner, who was due to meet with Ms. Arbour herself, the two were bundled into cars by plainclothes police officers. Relatives of a number of detained students who were also there to see the High Commissioner were arrested along with the two women. Following the incident, Ms. Ebadi protested vehemently and a few minutes later they were released. Background information: Mr. Mansour Osanloo was abducted on July 10, 2007 by unidentified assailants as he was leaving a public bus near his home at around 7 pm. According to witnesses, Mr. Osanloo’s assailants beat him severely, and continued to beat him as they took him away in a metallic grey Peugeot to an undisclosed location. Mr. Osanloo had apparently been followed all day by the unmarked Peugeot car. Such vehicles are well known as being associated with the Iranian Security Forces. On July 12, 2007, Mr. Osanloo’s arrest was acknowledged by the Revolutionary  Prosecutor Mortazavi. Since then, Mr. Osanloo was reportedly charged with “conspiring against national security”. The Observatory expresses its deep concern about these acts of intimidation against Mr. Osanloo’s relatives, as well as about his arbitrary detention, and fears it might be directly linked to his trade union activities. As a matter of fact, Mr. Osanloo and leaders of Sandikaye Sherkate Vahed are regularly subjected to acts of reprisals (See Observatory Annual Report 2006). Actions requested: Please write to the authorities in Iran urging them to:  Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Mansour Osanloo as well as of his relatives, in particular his wife Ms. Parvaneh Osanloo and his sister; Release Mr. Mansour Osanloo immediately and unconditionally as his detention is arbitrary; Put an end to all acts of harassment against all Iranian human rights defenders; Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, and Article 12.2, which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”; More generally, ensure in all circumstances the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with international and regional human rights instruments ratified by Iran.
