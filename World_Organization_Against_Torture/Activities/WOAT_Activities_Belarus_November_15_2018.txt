URGENT APPEAL - THE
OBSERVATORY

 
BLR 003 / 1118 / OBS 134
Judicial harassment
Belarus
November 15, 2018
 
The Observatory for the Protection of Human
Rights Defenders, a partnership of FIDH and the World Organisation Against
Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in
Belarus.
 
Description of the
situation:
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable
sources about the judicial harassment of Mr. Ales Burakou, a human
rights defender and journalist, editor of the human rights web platform “Human
rights in Mogilev” (the regional website of the Human Rights Center “Viasna”),
and member of the FIDH-affiliated organisation Human Rights Center “Viasna”
(HRC “Viasna”).
 
According to the information
received, on October 8, 2018, the Office for the economic crimes of the
Oktyabrsky Department of Internal Affairs of Mogilev (ROVD) launched an
investigation into Mr. Burakou’s activities as a human rights defender and
journalist under Article 193.1 of the Criminal Code, on suspicion of
“involvement in the activities of an unregistered organization”, the Human
Rights Center “Viasna”, putting pressure on him in an attempt to halt his human
rights-related journalism. The investigation alleges that Mr. Burakou’s
activities relate to the HRC “Viasna” and therefore violate Article 193.1 of the
Criminal Code, which was used in the past by the authorities to harass other
representatives of the HRC “Viasna”[1].
 
On November 8, Mr. Burakou was summoned to the
ROVD to provide explanations about his activities related to the web platform
“Human rights in Mogilev”, as well as to the HRC “Viasna” and it was through
the interrogating officer that Mr. Burakou was informed about the investigation
for the first time. Mr. Burakou refused to give self-incriminating statements,
invoking Article 27 of the the Constitution[2].
The ROVD official who interrogated Mr. Burakou, officer Mr. Pavel Kot,
threatened him and warned him to stay away from human rights journalism and “to
keep quiet”, otherwise he could face problems. Although Mr. Burakou was not
detained or charged, the officer threatened Mr. Burakou by telling him that
they “will meet again in the future”.
 
This is already the second attempt of the authorities
to put pressure on the human rights defender. In September 2018, the ROVD
conducted another investigation into Mr. Burakou’s activities related to the
same web platform. Mogilev’s authorities initiated the investigation after
receiving a complaint of the owners of the carbon plant “Omsk Carbon”, which
was criticised by Mr. Burakou for its damaging effect on the ecosystem of
Mogilev in an article published on HRC Viasna’s regional website. 
 
The Observatory condemns the judicial harassment
of Mr. Ales Burakou, as it seem to be only aimed at punishing him for his
legitimate human rights activities. The Observatory urges the authorities of
Belarus to end any act of harassment, including at the judicial level, against
him and all the human rights defenders in the country. 
 
Background information
 
In November 2003, the Supreme Court of the
Republic of Belarus abusively deregistered the HRC “Viasna”, which ultimately
led to a prohibition of its activities in Belarus. On August 7, 2004, the
United Nations (UN) Human Rights Committee recognised this step as a violation
of the right to freedom of association, which the Republic of Belarus must
ensure in accordance with its obligations under the International Covenant on
Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) (Decision No. 1296/2004). Accordingly, the
UN asked the Belarusian government to provide the founders of the organisation
with appropriate remedies, including the re-registration of the HRC “Viasna”.
The government failed to comply with the UN decision and HRC “Viasna” remains
de-registered as of today. 
 
On November 24, 2011, the Minsk Pervomaiski
District Court sentenced Mr. Ales Bialiatski, President of the HRC
“Viasna” and then FIDH Vice-President, to four and a half years of imprisonment under trumped-up charges of “tax evasion”[3].
 
Actions requested:
 
Please write to the
authorities of Belarus, urging them to:
 
i. Put an end to any form of harassment,
including at the judicial level, against Mr. Ales Burakou, HRC “Viasna”, as
well as all human rights defenders in Belarus;
 
ii. Guarantee in all circumstances the physical
and psychological integrity of Mr. Ales Burakou, the other members of HRC
“Viasna”, and all human rights defenders in Belarus;
 
iii. Comply with all their international obligations
to respect the exercise of the citizens’ right to freedom of association and
assembly, as established in the International Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights, in particular its Articles 21 and 22;
 
iv. Comply with the provisions of the United Nations
Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, in particular with its Articles 1, 2, 5
and 12.2;
 
v. Ensure in all circumstances respect for human
rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights
standards and international instruments ratified by Belarus.

193.1 of the Criminal Code of Belarus outlaws the activities of organisations
which have not been registered by the State. International and Belarusian human
rights organisations have repeatedly stated the unconstitutional nature of this
article and its incompatibility with international human rights norms. The same
opinion on Article 193.1 of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Belarus was
also issued by the European Commission for Democracy through Law (Venice
Commission at the Council of Europe).
