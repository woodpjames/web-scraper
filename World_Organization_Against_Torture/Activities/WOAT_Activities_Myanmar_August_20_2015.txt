August 20, 2015
The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of
the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation
Against Torture (OMCT), has received new information and requests your urgent
intervention in the following situation in Burma / Myanmar.
New
information: 
The
Observatory has been informed by reliable sources of the release of Ms. Su Su Nway, leader of the
Myanmar Farmers Union.
According
to the information received, on August 17, 2015, Ms. Su Su Nway was released from Pegu
Prison, Pegu Division, on time served, after Pegu Township Court sentenced her
to 15 days in prison with hard labour under Article 447 of the Criminal Code
(trespassing) for her involvement in helping farmers to seek the return of
their confiscated land. Ms. Su Su Nway had already spent over 20 days in police
custody while awaiting trial.
The Observatory
welcomes the release of Ms. Su Su Nway, and thanks all the individuals, institutions, and organisations that
intervened in her favour. 
However, the
Observatory strongly condemns the fact that Ms. Su Su Nway was handed a guilty
verdict in the first place and deeply regrets that she was arbitrarily detained
on trumped-up charges for over 20 days.
Background
information:
In early
June 2015, police in Intagaw, Pegu Township, Pegu
Division, informed Ms. Su Su Nway that
a local Army commander, Captain Hein Zaw, had filed charges against her for
trespassing. She had refused to answer the charge.
On
July 23, 2015, police in Intagaw arrested Ms. Su Su Nway after she had met with
farmers seeking the return of land that the military had confiscated from them
in Nyaunglebin Township in 2003. Ms. Su Su Nway was on her way back to Rangoon
when she was arrested.
The
same day, a court in Pegu Division charged Ms. Su Su Nway under Article 447 of
the Criminal Code (trespassing) and sent her to Pegu Prison. Ms. Su Su Nway
denied the charges and turned down bail, which had been granted by the court.
Ms. Su Su Nway had previously been detained on
various occasions between 2005 and 2007. She was eventually released along with
hundreds of other political prisoners during a presidential amnesty allowed on
October 12, 2011.
