Brief description of the situation: The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources of the attempt to ban the Association for Justice, Peace and Democracy (Associação Justiça, Paz e Democracia - AJPD), one of the most active human rights organisation in Angola. In particular, AJPD carries out human rights awareness activities, including human rights training for police officers. According to the information received, on September 4, 2008, the Association for Justice Peace and Democracy was informed by the Constitutional Court in Angola that a legal action had been initiated by the General Prosecutor in order to ban it. The legal basis of the action is that the founding documents of the organisation would “contain articles that are in contravention of the Angola Law of Associations”. AJPD has been given until September 19, 2008 to prepare its defence. This legal procedure intervenes in a context in which, on September 5, 2008, Angola held its first elections in 16 years. In June 2008, AJPD had called on the Angolan authorities not to unilaterally change the electoral law and extend the elections over two days, rather than one. Prior to the elections, AJPD had also put out statements condemning alleged electoral irregularities and vote-buying.  Moreover, the action against AJPD comes three months after the authorities officially closed the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Angola and almost two years after they banned the only human rights organisation operating in the Angolan Province of Cabinda at the time, Mpalabanda[1]. The Observatory expresses its deep concern about this attempt to ban AJPD, and recalls that in the run-up to the elections at the United Nations Human Rights Council in 2006, Angola had declared that it will “promote and protect human rights at the national level by: 1. Mainstreaming human rights throughout the society; 2. Promoting the rule of law, access to justice and reconciliation; […] 4. Promoting legislative measures in order to better harmonize the domestic legal order with Angolan international obligations in the field of human rights; 5. Continuing to support a constructive dialogue and increased cooperation with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights in Angola; […]”[2].  Accordingly, the Observatory urges the Angolan authorities to “take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of his or her rights”, in conformity with Article 12.2 of the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the UN General Assembly on December, 9, 1998. Background information: In 2007, the Director of the Angolan Government’s Technical Unit for the Coordination of Humanitarian Aid (UTCAH) had announced in a meeting with national and international NGOs based in Angola that the Government would soon cease the activities of NGOs without a social impact for the population or for the executive. He later accused four prominent human rights organisations - namely the AJPD, Mãos Livres, the Angolan branch of the Open Society Initiative of Southern Africa, and the Open Society Foundation -, as well as the local housing rights organisation SOS-Habitat, of alleging human rights violations to justify their activities while actually carrying out actions contrary to the law. He had also accused them of inciting people to react, even violently at times, against governmental institutions and authorities and threatened to ban them. Actions requested: Please write to the authorities in Angola, urging them to:   Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of all Angolan human rights defenders;  Ensure in all circumstances that AJPD members as well as all Angolan human rights defenders are able to carry out their work freely without any hindrances;  Put an end to the harassment against all human rights defenders in Angola;  Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, and the above-mentioned Article 12.2;  Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by Angola.
