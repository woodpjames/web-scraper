The Observatory has been alerted by several Egyptian Human Rights  and Civil Society Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO) that have  denounced a security directed orientation of the Egyptian government  that constitutes a violation of all constitutional rules and of the  human rights instruments ratified by the Egyptian government. This  situation occurred after two organizations proceeded to the  registration according to the new regulations and were eventually  denied the right to exist legally or the permission to receive  funding from abroad by the Ministry of Social Affairs.  For instance, the application of the New Woman Research Center was  rejected on the basis of a letter from the Security Directorate of  Giza addressed to the Giza Directorate of the Ministry of Social  Affairs and stating that "security authorities do not agree upon the  registration of the mentioned institution".   The Observatory condemns any form of pressure that would be exerted  by any security authority over the administration of the Ministry of  Social Affairs in order to prevent the registration of a new NGO.  A second organization, The Land Center for Human Rights applied in  the same way and did not receive any reply from the Ministry of  Social Affairs by the end of the 60 days period set in the law. This  organization will therefore be considered illegal within few days.  The Observatory also recalls that, regarding the restrictions on  freedom of association, the law 84 of June 2002 goes further than the  previous law enacted in 1999 and that the Constitutional High Court  had declared unconstitutional in June 2000. Thus, concerning the  restriction of civil activity, the Observatory believes that the  purpose of the Law 84 of 2002 will indeed amount to impose State  authority on civil society through usurping the will of NGO members  and imposing penalties on the activities of voluntary civil society.  Furthermore, the law contains wide powers allowing the Minister of  Social Affairs to dissolve NGOs at its own discretion; the two cases  mentioned above show that the refusal from the Ministry of Social  Affairs is not motivated and could be considered as arbitrary  decisions. Therefore, the Observatory claims that any case of NGO  disbanding should come before a regular court and that such a court  should be the only competent organ to examine any case where an NGO  contravenes the law.  The Observatory calls for the amendment of the current law and urges  the government to uphold the rights and freedoms contained in the  international covenants, in particular the freedom of association  guaranteed in article 20 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  of 1948 as well as article 22 of International Covenant on civil and  political rights of 1966, ratified by Egypt in 1982 and article 8 of  the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders of 1998.  The Observatory reaffirms the concerns it has already mentioned in  its Annual report of 2002 and several letters sent to the highest  authorities and will refer this matter to Mrs. Hina Jilani, Special  Representative of the UN Secretary General on Human Rights Defenders,  who already reported on the issues raised by the present law related  to Non-Governmental Organizations during the last session of the UN  Commission on Human Rights.  Yours respectfully,                                 Sidiki KABA, President of the FIDH                                                                 Eric SOTTAS, Director of the OMCT
