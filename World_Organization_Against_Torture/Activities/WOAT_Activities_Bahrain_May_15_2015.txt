The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights
Defenders, a joint programme of the International Federation for Human Rights
(FIDH) and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), has received new
information and requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in
Bahrain.
New information:
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources
about the sentencing and continued arbitrary detention of Mr. Nabeel Rajab, President
of the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights (BCHR), FIDH Deputy Secretary General
and a member of the Advisory Committee of Human Rights Watch’s Middle East
Division.
According to the information received, on May 14,
2015, the Bahrain Criminal Court of Appeal upheld the six-month prison sentence
issued by a lower court on January 20, 2015 against Mr. Rajab on charges of
“insulting public institutions and the army” via Twitter (the “terrorism tweet”
case). 
Mr. Rajab currently remains in solitary
confinement in Isa Town Police Station. The Observatory recalls that
Mr. Rajab faces additional charges in two other cases.
The Observatory denounces the new sentencing and
continued arbitrary detention of Mr. Nabeel Rajab, and calls for his
immediate and unconditional release, as he is targeted solely for his human
rights activities.
The Observatory, more generally, urges the Bahraini
authorities to put an end to all acts of harassment against Mr. Rajab, and
to comply with relevant international human rights standards and instruments,
in particular the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of 1966,
and the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the UN General Assembly
on December 9, 1998.
Background information:
Mr. Rajab has faced continuous judicial
harassment for his legitimate human rights work since his first arrest in June
2012. Mr. Rajab was sentenced to three months imprisonment for allegedly
libelling the residents of Al Muharraq via several tweets posted on his twitter
account. On August 23, 2012, Mr. Nabeel Rajab was acquitted by the Higher
Appeal Court.
On August 16, 2012, the Lower Criminal Court sentenced
Mr. Nabeel Rajab to three years of imprisonment in relation to three cases
related to his participation in peaceful gatherings in favour of fundamental
freedoms and democracy. In December 2012, the Appeals Court reduced the
sentence to two years of imprisonment. Mr. Nabeel Rajab completed his
sentence and was released in May 2014.
On October 1, 2014, Mr. Nabeel Rajab was summoned
and remanded in detention by the General Directorate of Anti-corruption and
Economic and Electronic Security of the Criminal Investigation Department for
“insulting a public institution” via Twitter. The case is related to a tweet he published in
September 2014, in which he criticised the military institutions for generating
extremist ideologies (the “terrorism tweet” case). On October 9, 2014,
Mr. Nabeel Rajab was informed that the Ministry of Defence had filed a
complaint regarding the same tweet. On November 2, 2014, the Third Lower
Criminal Court ordered Mr. Rajab’s release but barred him from leaving the
country.
On January 20, 2015, the Third Lower Criminal Court
sentenced Mr. Nabeel Rajab to six months imprisonment on the charges of
“insulting public institutions and the army” via Twitter pursuant to Article
216 of the Bahraini Penal Code. Mr. Nabeel Rajab's lawyers appealed the
sentence. Appeal hearings were held by the Bahrain Criminal Court of Appeal on
February 11, March 4 and 15, April 5 and May 4. 
In 2015, other criminal charges have been brought
against Mr. Rajab. On February 26, 2015, Mr. Rajab was summoned for
investigations in a different case for charges of “inciting hatred towards the
regime” in relation to a speech he made in February 2011 during a funeral (the
“funeral speech case”). To date, the police investigation is ongoing.
On April 2, 2015, at 4:00 pm, over twenty police cars
surrounded Mr. Rajab’s house and policemen arrested him on charges of
“spreading false news”. The arrest relates to a tweet from Mr. Rajab
denouncing the torture of detainees at Jaw Prison. Mr. Rajab was then sent
to the General Directorate of Anti Corruption Economic and Electronic Security
to be interrogated and placed in detention in solitary confinement in Isa Town
Police Station. On April 3, 2015, Mr. Rajab was interrogated in the
presence of his lawyers by the Criminal Investigations Department (CID)
regarding two new charges brought against him. The first charge is “insulting a
statutory body” (Article 216 of the Bahraini Criminal Code) referring to the
Ministry of Interior in relation to tweets he posted denouncing the torture of
detainees at Jaw Prison (the “Jaw torture tweets” case). The second charge is
“disseminating false rumours in time of war” (Article 133 of the Bahraini
Criminal Code) in relation to tweets he published about the Saudi-Arabia led
coalition air strikes in Yemen (the “Yemen tweets” case). If sentenced on the
second charge, Mr. Rajab could be facing up to 10 years imprisonment.
Mr. Rajab refused to sign the police minutes of the investigations. On
April 4, 2015, Mr. Rajab was brought before the Public Prosecution, in the
presence of his lawyers. The Prosecution ordered seven days detention pending
investigation. On April 5, 2015, security police confiscated all electronics
devices belonging to Mr. Rajab and members of his family.
On April 11, 2015, the prosecution ordered an
additional fifteen days in detention for Mr. Rajab. On April 26, 2015, the
Public Prosecution officially charged Mr. Rajab with “disseminating false
news in time of war, which may undermine preparations and war operations”, as
well as with “openly discrediting a statutory entity”. The Public Prosecution
subsequently extended his detention for an additional fifteen days, pending the
reception of a report currently prepared by the Ministry of Interior regarding
the items seized from Mr. Rajab’s house after his arrest, when the
security forces raided his house and seized mobile phones, laptops and other
electronic devices. On May 11, the Bahraini High Court extended Nabeel Rajab´s
preventive detention for 15 days.
