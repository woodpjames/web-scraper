Milano, Head of the Business Unit for Luzon of AsiaPro Multipurpose Cooperative, at the Office of the Prosecutor, in Pasing City.The latter accused Mr. Bacalso and Mr. Fortaleza of distributing libelous materials to the public allegedly containing malicious and defamatory statements during a protest held on April 25, 2014. Also, Mr. Milano blamed the group of obstructing the flow of traffic and blocking the pedestrians due to Nagkaisa’s activity. Further, Mr. Milano stated that the public affairs were disturbed due to the loud speaker system used in the protest.The Observatory strongly condemns the judicial harassment of Mr. Edcil Bacalso, and Mr. Wilson Fortaleza, and calls on the Philippines authorities to immediately and unconditionally close the case and drop the charges brought against them, as their intended goal seems to be the sanctioning of and obstructing to their human rights activities and weaken their campaign against exploitation of workers.Background information:Based on Nagkaisa’s statement, AsiaPro is a supplier of contractual workers of several large corporations[2] that hides under the guise of a cooperative to evade compliance to labor laws and violate labor rights of its members and employees due to their non-payment of wages and other mandatory benefits such as the Social Security System.In March, 2014, despite the Supreme Court already ruled that AsiaPro must comply with core labor standards and other labor-related laws (G.R. No. 172101), AsiaPro was able to discontinue, through a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO), a labour union certification election in Galeo Equipment and Mining Company[3]. A total of 285 Galeo workers had already voted by the time when the balloting was stopped. Another 275 Galeo workers were unable to cast ballots and were disenfranchised due to the TRO.The election standoff arose from an attempt by the AsiaPro manpower cooperative to prevent the unionization efforts at Galeo.  Asiapro is claiming that the Galeo workers are their members and thus exempt from unionization. Galeo workers did not even know that they were members of Asiapro.On April 25, 2014, at 9:30am in San Rafael Street, Barangay Kapitolyo, Pasig City, Nagkaisa led a peaceful rally outside the building, where the AsiaPro central office is located, to protest against AsiaPro anti-human rights practices.The activity was attended by around 200 participants coming from various labor groups including the Partido ng Manggagawa, Associated Labor Unions-Trade Union Congress of the Philippines (ALU-TUCP), SENTRO, Bukluran ng Manggagawang Pilipino (BMP), and the Philippine Airlines Employees Association (PALEA). Equipped with sound system, flags, streamers, banners, and position papers, the demonstrators only criticize AsiaPro for their activities.Actions requested:Please write to the Philippines authorities urging them to:i.      Guarantee, in all circumstances, the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Edcil Bacalso and Mr. Wilson Fortaleza, as well as all human rights defenders in The Philippines;ii.     Put an end to all acts of harassment, including at the judicial level, against Mr. Edcil Bacalso and Mr. Wilson Fortaleza, as well as against all human rights defenders in the Philippines, and ensure in all circumstances that they are able to carry out their work without hindrances;iii.   Comply with all the provisions of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted on December 9, 1998 by the United Nations General Assembly, in particular:-        its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually or in association with others, to promote the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”,-        its Article 6.a, which states that "everyone has the right individually and in association with others to know, seek, obtain, receive and hold information about all human rights and fundamental freedoms, including having access to information as to how those rights and freedoms are given effect in domestic legislative, judicial or administrative systems",-        Article 12.1, which foresees that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to participate in peaceful activities against violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms”,-        and its Article 12.2 which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration.”iv.   Guarantee the respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and other international human rights instruments ratified by the Philippines.Addresses:·       H.E.
