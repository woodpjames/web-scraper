Obstacles to freedom of association
Israel / Occupied Palestinian Territory
February 1, 2010
The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in Israel.
Description of the situation
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the adoption of a new visa policy for international non governmental organisations (INGOs) humanitarian workers, which bans them from obtaining a legal status to exercise a professional activity in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT).
According to the information received, in December 2009, the Israeli Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) announced the implementation of a new visa policy, which consists in stopping to grant “B1” visas to INGO humanitarian workers[1]. A “B1” visa allows its holder to legally work in the Israeli-controlled areas, i.e. Israel, the OPT and East Jerusalem.
Henceforth, since autumn 2009, INGOs employees have been issued a “B2” tourist visa, which bears the explicit mention “NOT PERMITTED TO WORK” in the Israeli-controlled areas. Humanitarian INGO workers are therefore no longer be allowed to exercise in Israel, the OPT and East Jerusalem.
This new visa regime will affect between 140 and 150 INGOs that operate among the Palestinian population. Only 12 organisations, including the Red Cross and several Christian organisations active in the West Bank prior to 1967 and therefore registered with the Jordanian authorities, will not be submitted to this new regulation.
The Observatory firmly denounces this new visa regime, which directly deprives some human rights defenders from carrying through their activities in Israel and the OPT and will probably result in the closing down of the INGOs offices located in East Jerusalem[2].
Accordingly, the Observatory calls upon the Israeli authorities to revoke this new restrictive visa regime, so as to ensure international INGOs staff are provided with visas that clearly allow them to work and guarantee their unfettered access and movement within the entire OPT, as well as protect their ability to enter, exit and operate in all the Israeli-controlled areas.
The Observatory recalls that the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders provides for the necessity to create an environment where human rights defenders can operate without any hindrance.
Actions requested:
Please write to the authorities in Israel urging them to:

 Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of all human rights defenders in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory;
 Ensure free and unfettered access, movement and activities of humanitarian workers within all the Israeli-controlled areas;
 Put an end to any kind of harassment - including administrative - against all human rights defenders in Israel and the OPT and ensure in all circumstances that they are able to carry out their work without unjustified hindrances;
 Comply with the provisions of the Fourth 1949 Geneva Convention, recognised as norms of customary international law, in particular Article 55, which states “[...] the Occupying Power has the duty of ensuring the food and medical supplies of the population; it should, in particular, bring in the necessary foodstuffs, medical stores and other articles if the resources of the occupied territory are inadequate [...]”. as well as Article 59, which states that “if the whole or part of the population of an occupied territory is inadequately supplied, the Occupying Power shall agree to relief schemes on behalf of the said population, and shall facilitate them by all the means at its disposal […]”;
 Comply with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly on December 9, 1998, in particular Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, and Article 12(2), which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually or in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the [...] Declaration”;
 More generally, ensure in all circumstances the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms throughout the country and the OPT in accordance with international human rights instruments ratified by Israel.

[1] A policy change was forthcoming since July 2009. In August 2009, a number of INGO workers found that their application had been submitted to a "special committee", and received a tourist visa.
[2] Jerusalem being considered by the Israeli authorities to be a sovereign part of Israel, and East Jerusalem being recognised by the international community as an occupied territory, humanitarian INGO workers will therefore no longer be allowed to exercise neither in Jerusalem nor to deliver support or services to the Palestinian community of East Jerusalem.
