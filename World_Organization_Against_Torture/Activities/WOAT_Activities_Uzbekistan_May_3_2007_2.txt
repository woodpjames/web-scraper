New information: The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the sentencing of Mrs. Gulbahor Turayeva, a forensic expert, a member of Anima-kor, a non-governmental organisation working to protect the rights of medical doctors and their patients, as well as a human rights activist from Andijan. According to the information received, on April 18, 2007, the trial of Mrs. Gulbahor Turayeva for “attempting to overthrow the constitutional system”, “slander” and “producing and spreading materials threatening public order” began before the Andijan Regional Court. On April 24, 2007, the Court sentenced Mrs. Gulbahor Turayeva to six years in prison. The Observatory is deeply concerned about the sentencing of Mrs. Gulbahor Turayeva and fears for her physical and psychological integrity. The Observatory considers her detention, which appears to be aimed at sanctioning her human rights activities, as arbitrary. Background information: On January 14, 2006, Mrs. Gulbahor Turayeva was arrested at the Dustlik checkpoint, on the Kyrgyz-Uzbek border, as she was returning home with her son from a day-long trip to the Kyrgyz city of Osh. Uzbek border guards searched Mrs. Turayeva’s luggage, and found several books, including materials on human rights and books by leaders of the Uzbek opposition. Mrs. Turayeva was immediately arrested, on the ground that the books would be banned literature. Straight after her arrest, Mrs. Turayeva’s apartment was searched by secret services, which failed to produce anything suspicious. On January 16, 2006, Mrs. Turayeva was brought to the National Security Service of Andijan for a more thorough investigation. Since then, Mrs. Turayeva was detained at the National Security Service’s detention centre. Actions required: Please write to the Uzbek authorities urging them to:  Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mrs. Gulbahor Turayeva; Release Mrs. Gulbahor Turayeva immediately and unconditionally since her detention is arbitrary; Put an end to all acts of harassment against Mrs. Gulbahor Turayeva as well as all other human rights defenders in Uzbekistan; Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels” and article 12.2, which states that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”; Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by Uzbekistan.
