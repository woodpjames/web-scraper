57th session that took place from 18 April to 13 May 2016, the UNCAT
considered the reports submitted by France, Tunisia, Saudi Arabia, the
Philippines, Turkey and Israel. In accordance
with Article 19 of the Convention, State parties must every four years submit a
report to the CAT on measures taken to implement the Convention. These reports
are reviewed in public sessions, in which the respective State party has a constructive dialogue
about its report with the CAT experts. The day before the review of the report,
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that have submitted an alternative report
have the opportunity to meet for a private NGO briefing with the CAT to raise
and discuss their concerns. At the end of each session, the CAT publishes its “Concluding
Observations” with recommendations for each State reviewed, including issues
for follow up within one year.Please click here for the e-bulletin: http://www.omct.org/files/2016/05/23772/e_bulletin_57th_session_23mai.pdf
