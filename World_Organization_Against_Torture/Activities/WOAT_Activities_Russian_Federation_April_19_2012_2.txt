allegations of torture and ill-treatment/ Harsh conditions of detention/ Lack

The
International Secretariat of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) has received new information and requests
your URGENT intervention in the following situation in the Russian Federation.
New information
The International Secretariat
of OMCT has been informed by the Russian-Chechen Friendship Society (RCFS), a
member of OMCT SOS-Torture Network, about persistent allegations of torture and
other forms of ill-treatment suffered by Mr. Zubajr Isaevich Zubajraev, a 33-year-old Chechen, who
is currently detained under strict regime in penitentiary colony of Minusinsk, FKU UP -288/T, in the region of
Krasnojarsk. He would be in poor health due to torture, harsh prison conditions
and denial of adequate medical care. 
According to the information
received, after the court ruling in May 2009 (see below), Mr. Zubajr Isaevich Zubajraev was transferred to
several prisons, including to SIZO-1 prison in Krasnojarsk city, where he was
detained from July 2011 to September 2011. There, he was regularly beaten up by
four guards. In September 2011, Mr. Zubajr Isaevich Zubajraev was transferred
by train from SIZO-1 in Krasnojarsk to the penitentiary colony in Minusinsk. During
the transfer, he was allegedly beaten by the guards.
According to the most recent
information, Mr. Zubajr Isaevich Zubajraev is very skinny and unable to walk or
sit because of the pain. Mr. Zubajr Isaevich Zubajraev would be also regularly
beaten by the guards of Minusinsk penitentiary colony and detained in a very
humid cell with lack of fresh air. OMCT has also been informed that his lawyers
were denied access to him mid-April on the ground that “he did not want to see
them”. 
The
OMCT International Secretariat is seriously concerned about the physical and
psychological integrity of Mr. Zubajr Isaevich Zubajraev and about the persistent
allegations of torture and other forms of ill-treatment (see background information)[1].

OMCT
therefore reiterates its calls on the competent Russian authorities to
guarantee his safety at all times, and to ensure that he is promptly examined
by independent doctors and receives adequate medical care, in accordance, inter alia, with the recommendations of
the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading
Treatment or Punishment and the UN Body of Principles
for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment.
OMCT recalls that
the Russian Federation is legally bound to effectively ensure the physical and
psychological integrity of all persons deprived of liberty in accordance with
regional and international human rights law, and in particular, the European
Convention on Human Rights, the recommendations of the European Committee for
the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
Punishment, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the UN
Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of
Detention or Imprisonment. In line with their obligations under the
aforementioned treaties, it is also incumbent on the Russian authorities to
consider seriously any allegations of torture and ill-treatment, and to
undertake a thorough and impartial investigation in this regard.
Background information
In
August 2007, Mr. Zubajr Isaevich Zubajraev was
sentenced to five years in prison and sent to prison colony IAR- 154/25 in
Frolovo, Volgograd region, where he was allegedly tortured by prison colony officers
throughout the period he was held there. The acts of torture included severe
beatings, also with full plastic bottles, electroshocks, injection of unknown
substances, nailing to the ground and having to stand in the snow with bear
feet. On several occasions he was also placed in a punishment cell. 
Following
complaints about Mr. Zubajr Isaevich Zubajraev’s situation, he was reportedly
admitted to the prison hospital (penitentiary colonyЯР-154/15 also known
as LIU-125 prison hospital) in February 2008. However, according to the
information submitted, instead of receiving adequate medical care and
treatment, he was again subjected to torture and other forms of ill-treatment,
including beatings, allegedly by the chief of the penitentiary colony and his deputy. Mr. Zubajr
Isaevich Zubajraev was also reportedly threatened with psychiatric internment. 
In
November 2008, the Volgograd regional prosecutor inspected the prison hospital but reportedly found
no fault with the prison authorities. 
According
to the same information received, on 23 April 2009, Mr. Zubajr Isaevich Zubajraev’s
lawyer saw numerous signs of beatings on his body when
he came to visit him, including numerous bruises in the area of the chest, on
the shoulders and on the low part of the back. The lawyer stated that he
immediately demanded that a doctor and a chief of the LIU-15 be called, which
was refused by the penitentiary administration. Mr. Zubajraev said he had been beaten twice, on 10 and 12 April 2009.
Subsequently, a closed court hearing took
place on 12 May 2009 at the request of
the prison administration in order to consider whether to place Mr. Zubajr
Isaevich Zubajraev in stricter conditions of imprisonment. The prison administration justified this hearing on the basis of two
claims: firstly, Mr. Zubajraev was accused of having kept “banned”
pain-killers, which is contested by Mr. Zubajraev’s lawyer,
and secondly, he would have quarrelled with another inmate, although the latter
did not file any report or complaint about the alleged quarrel. Furthermore,
OMCT recalls that this hearing occurred on the same day as the hearing of one
of Mr. Zubajraev’s lawyer, Ms. Elena
Maglevannaya, who was being prosecuted by the administration of
Volgograd prison colony LIU-15 for “honour and business reputation protection”
(Article 152 of the Russian Civil Code)[2].
Following the court ruling, Mr.
Zubajr Isaevich Zubajraev was reportedly taken from
LIU-15 prison hospital in Volgograd, to
various detention places. On 21 May 2009, he was reportedly
brought to the hospital ward of SIZO-1 in Ekaterinburg (which is located on the
way to Krasnojarsk) after he was allegedly
severely beaten in the train convoy.
