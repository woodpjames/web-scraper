Description of the situation: The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the obstacles to the freedom of movement imposed on Mr. Danial Saoud, President of the Committees for the Defence of Democratic Freedoms and Human Rights (CDF). According to the information received, Mr. Danial Saoud was prevented from leaving Syria and from travelling to Geneva, Switzerland, where he was supposed to take part in the Seminar that is currently organised by OMCT from June 29 to July 3, 2009 and which is entitled “Addressing the economic, social and cultural root causes of violence through the UN Special Procedures System”. The Observatory denounces these obstacles to the freedom of movement imposed on Mr. Danial Saoud, and strongly condemns harassment faced by human rights defenders in Syria, which only aims at muzzling their freedom of expression and sanctioning their human rights activities. Obstacles to freedom of movement are indeed common practices in Syria. In 2008, more than 400 travel bans would have been issued by the authorities, including more than 100 against human rights defenders, preventing them from leaving Syria to attend workshops and human rights seminar abroad. Travel ban is an additional tool to silence Syrian human rights defenders and aims at restricting the right to travel based on the Emergency Law since the end of the 1960s. Since 2006, it has become a systematic policy by Syrian authorities that reached its climax in September 2008, when security agencies drafted extensive lists, which included individuals who had participated in general political and human rights activity. Actions requested: Please write to the authorities of Syria, urging them to:   Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Danial Saoud;  Put an end to any obstacle to his freedom of movement as well as of all human rights defenders in Syria, and ensure in all circumstances that Syrian human rights defenders are able to carry out their work without unjustified hindrances;  Comply with all the provisions of the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, in particular with its Article 1, which provides that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, its Article 5 (c), which states that “for the purpose of promoting and protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms, everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, at national and international levels (...) to communicate with non-governmental or intergovernmental organizations”, its Article 6 (b) regarding the right “to freely publish, impart or disseminate to others views, information and knowledge on all human rights and fundamental freedoms”, as well as with Article 12.2 (“the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”);  More generally, ensure in all circumstances the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with international and regional human rights instruments ratified by the Syrian Arab Republic.
