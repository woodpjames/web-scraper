Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Palestinian Society for the Protection for Human Rights (LAW), a member of the OMCT network, of the excessive use of force by Israeli occupying forces in the demolition of houses in the Palestinian Territories.   According to information gathered by LAW, an estimated 30 heavily armed soldiers arrived in the neighbourhoods of Mares Al Mithqah, Ra’s Al Labad and Harab Odeh at 3:30 am on 25th April 2000, forced the residents out of their houses, seized their IDs, registered their numbers and then tore down the houses and the tents.  In his affidavit, Mahmoud Hamdan, 60, retired, stated that he, his wife, his daughter Dima (27), his son Samed (10), his other son Rida (10), his daughter in law, Kifaya, and her children, Guram (3) and Tha’er (7), were sleeping in their tent when the soldiers arrived. They woke the residents and ordered them to leave the tent. They also tried to confiscate the power generator. Hamdan said, “We refused to leave the tent and my son Rida prevented them from taking the generator away. They ran towards him and beat him until he fell to the floor. A military doctor was summoned to examine him, and he asked the soldiers to refrain from attacking him. A few minutes later, a group security personnel in civilian clothing appeared; the soldiers pulled the young Palestinian boy and told the group that they could beat him. His sister Dima tried to save her brother but she was beaten with the butt of a rifle by one of the soldiers. Amid the confusion, the tent was torn down.  Action requested  Please write to the authorities in Israel urging them to:  i.	take all necessary measures to guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of all inhabitants in the occupied territories; ii.	guarantee an immediate investigation into the circumstances of these events, identify those responsible, bring them before a civil competent and impartial tribunal and apply the penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions provided by law; iii.	guarantee adequate restitution, compensation and rehabilitation to all injured people; iv.	guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
