Brief description of the situation: The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources of the sentencing of 66 year-old Mr. Novruzali Mammadov, a fervent defender of the cultural rights of the Talysh people, an ethnic minority living in the south of Azerbaijan, Head of the Talysh Cultural Center, Editor in chief of the Tolishi Sedo newspaper, and Department Head of the Linguistics Institute of the Science Academy. According to the information received, on June 24, 2008, the Grave Crime Court sentenced Mr. Novruzali Mammadov to ten years in prison for high treason (Article 274 of the Criminal Code the Azerbaijan Republic). The Court argued that Mr. Mammadov had collected “information necessary for the establishment of an administrative autonomy in the territories of Azerbaijan compactly populated by Talyshes”, and had spread a negative image of Azerbaijan abroad through appeals submitted to international organisations relating to “violations of the human rights of Talyshes”. During the trial, Mr. Mammadov pleaded not guilty, and informed the members of the Court of the physical and psychological torture he had been subjected to while in detention (including beating, food and water deprivation, night interrogation and threats to his family). However, these allegations of torture were all rejected by the Court. The verdict was reportedly announced in an empty room in absence of Mr. Mammadov’s attorney, after a closed trial. It is believed he was falsely accused and sentenced because of his activity protecting the right of the Talysh ethnic minority. Mr. Mammadov is currently detained at the pre-trial prison, waiting for his appeal to be heard. On February 2, 2007, Mr. Novruzali Mammadov had been called to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, where he was kept for several days without explanations, underwent beating and interrogated due to his participation at a scientific conference in Iran in 2004. On February 3, 2007, Mr. Mammadov was released but detained again on the same day. The Yasamal District Court then sentenced him to 15 days of imprisonment (administrative punishment) for his “resistance to legal demands of police officers”, although Article 30 of the Administrative Code provides that citizens who are over 65 years old shall not be sentenced to administrative punishment such as custodial placement. Mr. Novruzali Mammadov was subsequently detained at the Investigation Isolation Centre of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, where he allegedly underwent physical and psychological pressure for 15 days to force him to confess the acts of “espionage” in favour of Iran. Mr. Mammadov was not provided with an attorney during these 15 days and his relatives did know anything about his whereabouts. On February 17, 2007, he had been accused of high treason for espionage under Article 274 of the Criminal Code. He had been arbitrarily detained since then. Following the issuance of its June-24 decision, the Court clarified the sentencing for high-treason, on these terms:  “appealing to international organizations due to violation of human rights of Talysh people in order to damage Azerbaijan’s image” (such argument was presented neither during the investigation nor during the trial); “propaganda of the Talysh language, culture and art”; “passing necessary information to Iran” (neither the bill of particulars, nor the verdict, investigation and the court managed to prove that Mr. Mammadov passed information to Iran); “finding people in Azerbaijan who have necessary information for Iran and link them with special services of Iran” (this accusation was proved neither during investigation nor in court)”; “having taken the position of the chief-editor of the Talishi Sedo newspaper in 1998 to use the newspaper for anti-Azerbaijani activity and create an administrative autonomy in the future” (the newspaper was not published until 2001 and has never been meant to foster anti-Azerbaijani activities); “sending young Talysh people for getting religious education outside Azerbaijan (no facts and no name of Azerbaijani citizens who would have gone abroad on recommendation of Mr. Mammadov were provided during the investigation and the trial); “appealing to the management of the Public TV for opening a programme in Talysh language, and appealing to the Ministry of Justice for registering the Talysh Cultural Centre and the Tolishi Sedo newspaper” (this was groundlessly considered to be espionage in favour of Iran in the verdict); “cooperating with linguist colleagues from the USA, Canada, Britain, Germany, and research on the contemporary Talysh language by conducting social surveys, trips, etc.” (this purely scientific activity was also considered to be a criminal offence); “helping Talysh people to get a job within executive and legislative branches so that they use their connections for creating Talish administrative autonomy in future” (no specific fact or evidence was provided); “receipting of $15.000 from Iran’s special services in order to publish a newspaper” (this fact of money reception was not proved either).  The Observatory wishes to insist on the fact that these “clarifications” were issued without proofs, and are based exclusively on the self-confessions of a journalist of Tolishi Sedo, Mr. Elman Quliyev, who was also arrested and sentenced for six years in prison. The Observatory fears that these confessions were obtained through torture and ill-treatment. The Observatory was further informed that while Mr. Mammadov was in prison, his family has undergone pressure from the Ministries of National Security and Internal Affairs[1]. Further pressure is being exerted against members of the “Committee for the Defence of Mr. Mammadov’s Rights”. The Observatory expresses its utmost concern over this blatantly unfair decision and over these worrying acts of torture and ill-treatment, and recalls that under the terms of the Declaration of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe for enhanced protection of human rights defenders, adopted on February 6, 2008, member-States are required to “create an environment conductive to human rights defenders, to take effective measures to protect, promote, and respect them, to ensure their access to effective remedies, to take action to prevent attacks and harassment against them, and to ensure their effective access to the European Court of Human Rights”. The Observatory also points out that in the run-up to the elections at the United Nations Human Rights Council in 2006, Azerbaijan had declared that “protection and promotion of human rights [were] a priority of its internal and foreign policy agenda” and “that the rule of law, democracy and protection and promotion of human rights and main freedoms [were] key pillars for the national development”[2]. Accordingly, the Observatory urges the authorities to “take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of his or her rights”, in conformity with Article 12.2 of the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the UN General Assembly on December, 9, 1998. Actions requested: Please write to the authorities in Azerbaijan, urging them to:   Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Novruzali Mammadov;  Release Mr. Novruzali Mammadov immediately and unconditionally since his detention is arbitrary as it only aims at sanctioning his human rights activities;  Order a thorough and impartial investigation into the above-mentioned acts of torture and ill-treatment against Mr. Novruzali Mammadov and his relatives in order to identify all those responsible, bring them before a civil competent and impartial tribunal and apply to them the penal sanctions provided by the law;  Guarantee that adequate reparation is provided to Mr. Novruzali Mammadov;  Put an end to the harassment against all human rights defenders in Azerbaijan;  Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, and the above-mentioned Article 12.2;  Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by Azerbaijan.
