Brief description of the situation:The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by the Informal Sector Service Centre  (INSEC), a member of the OMCT network, about the extra-judicial execution of Mr. Dayaram Pariyar (22), a member of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), Branch Office of Janakpur, and Mr. Ram Chandra Yadav (55), an active cadre of the Rashtriya Prajatantra Party (RPP - National Democratic Party) by policemen on 24 and 28 March 2006.  According to the information received, on March 24, 2006, a group of Maoists came in a vehicle and attacked Mujeliya District Police Office, Dhanusha district (Janakpur). A policeman was killed on the spot and another one was shot injured on his leg. He then tried to escape, but the Maoists followed him, and caught him. Although the police officer requested the Maoists not to kill him, they shot him dead. Other policemen ran and plunged into a pond to save their life.  Half an hour after this incident, security forces from Janakpurdham went to the place and brought the dead bodies and other policemen to Janakpurdham. At 6.30 pm, security forces in a vehicle came from Janakpur Railway Station side towards Janakchowk. They were in position to attack. The vehicle stopped at Dhanusagar, ten meters far from the Janakchowk and all the policemen got down and made one round of blank fire. Right at the moment one of the policeman came forward and started indiscriminate firing resulting in the death of Mr. Ram Chandra Yadav, who was sitting north-east of the Janakchowk, and in the deadly injuring of Mr. Dayaram Pariyar.  After the incident, two policemen, who were standing at the northern side, made three rounds of blank fire, 15 meters from the spot where the incident took place.  Immediately, Mr. Dayaram Pariyar was taken to the Janakpur zonal hospital with the help of local people. He was admitted to the Teaching Hospital in Maharajgunj, Katmandu, on the following day.
