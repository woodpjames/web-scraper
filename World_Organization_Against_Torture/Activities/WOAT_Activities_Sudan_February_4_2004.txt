Brief description of the situation:  The Observatory has been informed by the Sudan Organization Against Torture (SOAT) of the arrest and detention of Mr. Salih Mahmoud Osman, a member of SOAT’s lawyers network.  Mr. Osman was arrested on February 1, 2004, at 11:00 pm at his home in Wad-Madani, capital of the Central Region in Sudan. He is currently being held at the National Security Agency (NSA) offices in Wad Madani and is reportedly being interrogated. Mr. Osman has not being charged with any offence.   At the time of his arrest, Mr. Osman was suffering from jaundice. Because of Mr. Osman’s poor health, his wife has been allowed to bring him food. However, she has reportedly been denied the right to visit him.   Mr. Osman is a well known lawyer and writer. Over the past year, he has provided free legal aid to hundreds of victims of human rights abuses in Darfur and has also provided legal representation to those facing capital or severe punishment (amputation and cross amputation) in the Darfur region.  The Observatory recalls that the members of SOAT—as well as many other human rights defenders in the country—have been the victims of human rights violations in the past. On January 5, 2004, members of the National Security Agency (NSA) arrested Mr. Waiel Taha, student and active member of the SOAT student network, and another student, Mr. Yousif Fat'h Al Rahman, outside Khartoum University Student Union Building. Both of them were released after being tortured while in detention.
