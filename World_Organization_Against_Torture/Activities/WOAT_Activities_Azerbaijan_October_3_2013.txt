The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the
World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and the International Federation for
Human Rights (FIDH), has received new information and requests your urgent
intervention in the following situation in Azerbaijan.
 
New information:
 
The
Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the sentencing to five years in prison of Mr. Hilal Mammadov,
a minority rights defender and
Editor-in-chief of the Tolishi-Sado (Voice of Talysh) newspaper[1]
who has been detained since June 21, 2012. 
 
According to the information received, on
September 27, 2013, Mr. Hilal Mammadov was sentenced to five years
in prison in a semi-closed trial at the Baku Grave Crimes Court. He was convicted of "illegal selling
of drugs", "high treason" and "incitement to national,
racial, social and religious hatred and hostility", under Articles 234.4.3,
274 and 283 of the Criminal Code of Azerbaijan
respectively. 
 
As
of October 2, 2013, Mr. Hilal
Mammadov remained detained at the Baku Investigation Isolator.
 
The
Observatory firmly condemns the conviction of Mr. Hilal Mammadov, and considers
it as another attempt to silence his efforts to report human rights violations
and defend minority rights in his country. 
 
The Observatory therefore reiterates its calls on the
Azerbaijani authorities to immediately
and unconditionally drop all charges against Mr. Mammadov and release him, as such practices seem to merely aim at sanctioning his human rights activities.
 
Background information:
 
On June 21, 2012, Mr.
Hilal Mammadov was arrested in relation to a criminal case opened against him
by the Nasimi District Police under Article 234.4.3 of the Criminal CodeThe
authorities alleged having seized five grams of heroin from him and about 30
grams at his place of residence. On June 22, 2012, the Nasimi District Court
sentenced Mr. Mammadov to three months of pre-trial detention.
 
On the same day, Mr.
Mammadov met with his lawyer, who discovered and photographed injuries on his
leg, and subsequently lodged a complaint for torture.
 
On July 4, 2012, the
accusations of illegal possession of drugs were contradicted by a joint
statement of the Interior Ministry and Prosecutor
General of Azerbaijan, which stated that Mr. Mammadov was in reality arrested
on the basis of information about his supposed “cooperation with the
intelligence agency of a foreign country”, “activities against the security and
territorial integrity of Azerbaijan”, as well as “incitement of national,
racial and religious hatred”. According to the authors of the statement, Mr.
Mammadov supposedly became an agent of foreign secret services 20 years ago.
 
On July 4, 2012, new
trumped-up charges were brought against Mr. Mammadov under Articles 274 and
283.2.2 of the Criminal Code. The investigators confiscated as evidence a
notebook computer as well as drives containing information. The criminal case
launched against him by the Nasimi District Prosecutor’s Office was transferred
to the Grave Crimes Investigation Department, under the General Prosecutor’s
Office.
 
On
July 31, 2012, the Nasimi District Court of Baku City denied the complaint that
Mr. Mammadov had filed to denounce acts of torture and ill-treatment he had suffered.
On August 29, 2012, the Nasimi District Court
further rejected the appeal that Mr. Mammadov's lawyers had filed against the
July-31 decision. On August 27, 2012, the Deputy General Prosecutor refused as
well to open proceedings on the complaint lodged against the acts of torture
and ill-treatment Mr. Mammadov suffered during the first days of his detention.
 
Again, on November 8, 2012, the Sabail District Court
rejected a complaint filed by Mr. Mammadov and based on a forensic examination,
denouncing the acts of torture and ill-treatment he suffered in the framework
of his arrest. This decision was upheld by a higher tribunal on November 19,
2012.
 
In September 2012, the
Baku Appeals Court denied him provisional release.
 
Furthermore, on November 26, 28 and 29, 2012, Mr. Mammadov was
beaten and injured by his
mentally ill cell mate in a Kurdakhani prison. As his cell mate's behaviour was
aggressive, Mr. Mammadov's lawyers requested on several occasions before the
attack to remove him from the cell, but their requests were all ignored. On
November 29, his cell mate was eventually transferred to the medical unit of
the prison hospital for treatment.
 
On December 21, 2012, the criminal case file on
Mr. Mammadov was transferred to the Court on Grave Crimes for trial. During the
first hearing, on January 9, 2013, Mr. Hilal Mammadov's lawyer submitted two
motions requesting the audio- and video-tape of the hearing, and that his
client be allowed to sit outside of the court cage, together with his lawyer.
However, both motions were rejected.
 
Action requested:
 
Please write to the authorities in Azerbaijan, urging them to:
 
i.       
Guarantee
in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Hilal
Mammadov as well as of all human rights defenders in Azerbaijan;

those responsible, bring them before an independent tribunal, and apply them

an end to any kind of harassment - including at the judicial level - against
Mr. Hilal Mammadov and more generally against all human rights defenders in
Azerbaijan;
 
v.

of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international
levels”, as well as its Article 12.2, which provides that the State shall “take
all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of
everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence,
threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or
any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise
of his or her rights”;
