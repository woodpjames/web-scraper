OMCT is also concerned that the villagers may be subjected to further harassment and violence should they continue to contest the legality of the aquafarm. Finally, OMCT expresses its concern that pollution from this aquafarm is compromising the villagers’ full enjoyment of their economic, social and cultural rights, and specifically those to an adequate standard of living and the highest attainable standard of health.
