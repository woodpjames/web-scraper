Judicial harassment

April 11, 2012
 
The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint 
programme of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World 
Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), has received new information and requests 
your urgent intervention in the following situation in Turkey.
 
New information:
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the 
release on bail of Mr. Ragıp Zarakolu, Honorary Board Member and Founder of the Human Rights Association 
(İnsan Haklari Derneği - İHD), 
Director of the Belge Publishing House 
and Chairman of the Publishers 
Association Freedom to Publish Committee of Turkey, and the ongoing arbitrary 
detention of Ms. Büşra Ersanlı, a lecturer at the Marmara 
University (Istanbul) Faculty of Political Sciences and International 
Relations who has been engaged with NGOs for political rights of the 
women.
 
According to the information received, on April 10, 2012, the 
İstanbul Heavy Penal Court No. 15 ordered the release on bail of Mr. Ragıp 
Zarakolu. 
 
The Observatory recalls that the latter had been arrested in Istanbul 
on October 28, 2011, together with Ms. Büşra Ersanlı, as part of a vast 
anti-terrorist operation intended to dismantle part of an alleged terrorist network - the 
Kurdish Communities Union (KCK) - that in fact targeted more than 193 peaceful activists who are not related to any terrorist activities for their opinion on the Kurdish issue (See background information). 

 
As of issuing this Urgent Appeal, Ms. Ersanlı remains detained at 
the Bakırköy closed prison for females.
 
On April 3, 2012, the court accepted the indictment order and set 
July 2, 2012 at the Silivri Prison Complex for the first hearing of the case. 
Mr. Zarakolu now faces up to 15 years of prison on charges of “knowingly and 
willingly helping an organised criminal group” under Article 220/7 of the 
Turkish Penal Code (TPC) and Ms. Ersanlı up to 22 and a half years of prison on 
charges of “belonging to a criminal organisation” under Article 314 of the TPC. 

 
The Observatory welcomes the release on bail of Mr. Ragıp Zarakolu 
and thanks all the persons, institutions and organisations who intervened in his 
favour. However, it denounces the ongoing arbitrary detention of Ms. 
Büşra Ersanlı as well as the judicial harassment against the two 
human rights defenders, and calls upon the Turkish authorities to put an end to 
the continuing harassment against them, which seems to only aim at sanctioning their human rights 
activities.
 
The Observatory further recalls that several İHD members remain today 
in pre-trial detention, notably Mr. Muharrem Erbey, İHD General Vice 
Chairperson and Chairperson of its Diyarbakir Province branch who had been 
detained since December 2009, Mr. Arslan Özdemir and Ms. Roza 
Erdede, İHD members in Diyarbakır, as well as lawyers, trade unionists, 
journalists and members of associations of families of victims of abusive 
anti-terrorism policies. Dozens of other human rights defenders also remain in 
provisional release pending the outcome of criminal trials on alleged terrorism 
charges. 
 
Background information:
 
On October 28, 2011, Mr. Ragıp Zarakolu and Ms. Büşra Ersanlı were both 
arrested in Istanbul as part of a vast operation that targeted more than 48 
activists, mostly Kurdish political activists and particularly members of the 
Peace and Democracy Party (BDP). On November 1, 2011, the two were officially 
charged with “being a member of an illegal organisation”, namely the KCK - an 
organisation said to be the “urban branch” of the armed Kurdistan Workers Party 
(PKK) - under Article 314 of the TPC by İstanbul Heavy Penal Court No. 
14.

which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the 
protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in
