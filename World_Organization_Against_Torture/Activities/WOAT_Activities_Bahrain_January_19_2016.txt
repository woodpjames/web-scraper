The World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), together with IFEX members and other groups from around the 
world urge the government of Bahrain to respect the rights of 
internationally renowned interfaith leader and human rights advocate. We, the undersigned civil society groups working to promote and 
defend freedom of expression worldwide, write to you to condemn the 
ongoing harassment of human rights defenders in Bahrain and call on you 
to drop all charges pending against Sheikh Maytham Al-Salman. 

Sheikh Maytham is an internationally respected interfaith leader and
human rights advocate. His work focuses on defending religious freedom 
and countering violent extremism while supporting the right to freedom 
of expression in accordance with international human rights standards. 
In October of 2015, Sheikh Maytham was honoured for his work with the 
Interfaith Communities for Justice and Peace “Advocate for Peace” award.

Bahraini authorities have harassed Sheikh Maytham on numerous occasions, including two separate incidents in 2015 when he was detained for his human rights activities. He was most recently summoned in connection to the content of a speech he gave on 27 December, the anniversary of the arrest of prisoner of conscience Sheikh Ali Salman, in which he drew attention to the violations of international fair trial standards that took place.

After being interrogated at the General Directorate of Criminal 
Investigations (CID) Sheikh Maytham was accused of “expressing views 
regarding a case still in court” and “inciting hatred against the 
regime”. The levelling of such accusations is part of an ongoing effort 
to silence human rights defenders through restrictive measures aimed at 
punishing those who speak out on political or social issues. 

These measures are in violation of Article 19 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which Bahrain has been a
signatory to since 2006. It also contradicts the obligations of the 
state to protect human rights defenders, as derived from their 
obligation to protect all human rights under Article 2 of the ICCPR.

Rather than ensure their protection, Bahrain has made a habit out of
persecuting dissidents and activists. Sheikh Maytham joins other 
high-profile individuals like BCHR President Nabeel Rajab, activist Zainab al-Khawaja and human rights defender Naji Fateel that have been targeted for their work and denied their right to freedom of opinion and expression. 

The undersigned call on the Government of Bahrain to allow the 
important work of Sheikh Maytham and others who bring human rights 
violations to light to be conducted unimpeded, as provided for under the
ICCPR and other relevant international human rights standards by taking
the following steps:
Drop all pending charges against Sheikh Maytham Al-Salman for exercising his right to freedom of speech;Release all prisoners who have been convicted for their political opinions; andFully comply with the recommendations of the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry (BICI); particularly those that ensure the right to freedom of expression, opinion and assembly are respected.Signed,
