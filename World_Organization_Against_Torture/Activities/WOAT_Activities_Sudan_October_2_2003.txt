Brief description of the situation  The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by a Sudanese Organisation against Torture, a member of the OMCT network, of the arrest, detention and concerns for the personal integrity of Osman Ahmed Fagharay, a Beja tribe member, in Sudan.  According to the information received, on Saturday, September 28th, 2003, the National Security Agency (NSA) arrested 54-year-old Osman Ahmed Fagharay, who is a member of the Beja tribe. He was arrested at an unknown location and then taken to his house in Shambat Alaradi, Khartoum North. He changed clothes and informed his family that he was under arrest by the security agents. At 8 p.m. he was permitted to call his family and informed them that he was well. He told them that he was being questioned at the NSA offices and would likely be released on the same day or early the next day. Mr. Fagharay has not yet been released. Furthermore, Mr. Fagharay suffers from diabetes and does not have his medication with him. Reports indicate that Mr. Fagharay’s son has taken him his medicine, but it is unclear as yet whether the security forces have allowed it to be delivered to him.  Mr. Fagharay is a retired Police Chief from Al a’Mra’ar, one of the clans belonging to the Beja tribe in eastern Sudan, and a former administrator of the Red Sea province during the late 1980s. He was arrested following his participation in a symposium at Alnilain University, which was organised by the Beja Students Association, where he criticised the health, economic and food security policies in the Red Sea province and demanded action by the government.   The International Secretariat of OMCT is concerned for Mr. Fagharay’s physical and psychological integrity, given his medical condition and the risk that he runs of being subjected to ill-treatment or potentially torture while in detention. OMCT therefore urges the authorities to guarantee his integrity at all times and ensure that Mr. Fagharay has immediate access to appropriate medical assistance, notably his medication. Furthermore, OMCT calls on the authorities to immediately release him in the absence of valid legal charges that are consistent with international law and standards.   Action requested  Please write to the authorities in Sudan urging them to:  i.	take all necessary measures to guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Fagharay; ii.	guarantee his immediate access to appropriate medical assistance, notably medication for diabetes; iii.	order his immediate release in the absence of legal charges that are consistent with international law and standards, or, if such charges exist, bring him before an impartial and competent tribunal and guarantee his procedural rights at all times; iv.	guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights standards.
