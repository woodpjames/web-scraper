Rights Defenders in Cambodia: A Call For Support

In 2014, human rights defenders
in Cambodia continue to be the target of intimidation, arbitrary arrests
and spurious criminal charges, particularly when their activism relates to
land and labour rights. This side event will present the perspective
and outlook of human rights defenders with a view to explore ways for the
international community to support the protection of human rights
defenders in Cambodia.
During the side event the documentary "The
Rights of Others" will be screened.
