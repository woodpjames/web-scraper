The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a partnership of FIDH
and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent
intervention in the following situation in Myanmar.
 
Description of the situation:
 
The
Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the killing of Mr. O Moo, a member of both the Mutraw
Emergency Assistance Team (MEAT)[1]
and Karen National Union (KNU). Mr. O Moo was an ethnic Karen community leader who
actively advocated for the right of Karen, including land rights and forest management.
 
According
to the information received, on April 5, 2018, Mr. O Moo was fatally shot by Tatmadaw
[Myanmar army] soldiers while he was riding a motorbike with a soldier from the armed
ethnic group Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA). Mr. O Moo was on his way home in Ler Mu Plaw Village, Papun Township,
Karen State, after providing humanitarian aid to villagers displaced by renewed
hostilities between the army and the KNLA. It was reported that despite several
attempts villagers were not able to retrieve Mr. O Moo’s body as they came
under fire when they returned to the place where he was killed.
 
The
Observatory condemns in the strongest terms the killing of Mr. O Moo and urges
the Burmese authorities to carry out a thorough, impartial, and transparent
investigation into his murder without undue delay and to hold those responsible
accountable.
 
The
Observatory expresses its utmost concern over ongoing deadly attacks against
human rights defenders in Myanmar[2]
and reiterates its call upon the Burmese authorities to adopt effective
measures to ensure the protection of human rights defenders in the country and
to ensure proper investigations into these killings.
 
Actions requested:
 
Please
write to the authorities in Myanmar asking them to:
 
i. Guarantee in all circumstances the
physical and psychological integrity of all
human rights defenders in Myanmar;
 
ii.
Carry out an immediate, thorough, impartial, and transparent investigation into
the murder of Mr. O Moo in order to identify all those responsible, bring them
before an independent tribunal, and sanction them as provided by the law;
 
iii.
Put an end to all acts of harassment against all human rights defenders in Myanmar,
and ensure that they are able to
carry out their activities without hindrance;
 
iv.
Comply with all the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders,
adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on December 9, 1998, in
particular with its Articles 1 and 12.2;

Since early March 2018, the Burmese army has been launching
its military offensive in Mutraw (Hpapun) District against the Karen National
Liberation Army (KNLA)’s 5th Brigade, Ler Mu Plaw area. This has caused an
outbreak of fighting between the KNLA and the Burmese army. As a consequence,
over 2,300 local villagers were forced to flee from their homes. To help the
displaced villagers, a number of Karen community organisations and local groups
have established the Mutraw Emergency Assistance Team with the mission to
provide humanitarian support to the displaced villagers.
