		Judicial harassment

Cameroon
		May 3, 2018

		 

		The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a 
partnership of World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and FIDH, has 
received new information and requests your urgent intervention in the 
following situation in Cameroon. 

		 

New information:

		 

		The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources of the ongoing 
judicial harassment against Mr. Musa Usman Ndamba, 
National Vice President of the Mbororo Social and Cultural Development 
Association (MBOSCUDA)[1] 
.

		 

		According to the information received, on April 27, 2018, the 60th hearing 
in the trial against Mr. Musa Usman Ndamba which opened in 2013, was held 
before the Bamenda Court of First Instance. Mr. Usa Usman Ndamba’s is 
being tried on charges of “propagation of false information”, 
“false oath”, “false report” and “defamation 
of character”, under section 113, 166, 304(1) and 305(1) of the 
Criminal Code of Cameroon and which are punishable by a prison sentence of 
up to 5 years and a fine of up to 2 million FCFA (approximatively 3000 
euros). These charges follow a complaint filed by Mr. Baba Ahmadou Danpullo, 
a billionaire businessman, cattle rancher, tea plantation owner and a member 
of the Central Committee of the ruling Cameroon People’s Democratic 
Movement (CPDM) party (see background information).

		 

		During the hearing, Barrister Joseph Akong, who was responsible in May 
2013 for notarising the affidavit on the basis of which Mr. Ndamba is being 
charged, appeared as a court witnessed and informed the court that Mr. 
Ndamba was not the person for whom he notarised the affidavit, and that he 
had only met Mr. Ndamba during the preliminary investigation of the case. 
This was the last hearing of the trial and the judgment is expected to be 
rendered on May 11, 2018.

		 

		The Observatory recalls that the alleged defamatory statements contained 
in the affidavit are not signed by the defender but by another individual 
named Mr. Musa Adamu. According to the plaintiff, Mr. Ndamba is the author 
of these statements, and he intentionally changed his name in order to 
escape prosecution. However, Mr. Ndamba was able to provide evidence that he 
had never changed his name in the form of an expired identity card dated 
July 20, 2000. 

		 

		The Observatory fears that the ongoing judicial harassment against Mr. 
Ndamba comes in as a retaliation to his human rights activities, in 
particular as MBOSCUDA’s National Vice President. Moreover, these acts 
of harassment are not isolated, as the Observatory has reported several 
cases of judicial harassment against leaders of civil society organisations 
denouncing the government’s corruption and opposing land grabbing in 
Cameroon. Many of these acts are linked to cases of land acquisition by 
Mr. Baba Ahmadou Danpullo 
[2].

		 

		The Observatory expresses its deepest concerns about those acts of 
harassment, and fears that they have increased after MBOSCUDA and its 
members submitted in early May 2013 a report in the framework of the United 
Nations Human Rights Council Universal Periodic Review (UPR) of Cameroon in 
Geneva, outlining the various obstacles faced by the Mbororo community[3].

		 

		The Observatory strongly condemns these acts, and urges Cameroonian 
authorities to put an end to all forms of harassment, including at the 
judicial level, against Mr. Ndamba and all human rights defenders in 
Cameroon so that they are able to carry out their legitimate and peaceful 
human rights activities without any hindrance or fear of reprisals.

		 

		The Observatory further urges the Cameroonian authorities to ensure that, 
until all charges are dropped, all judicial proceedings are carried out in 
full compliance with his right to a fair trial, as protected under 
international law, including his right to be tried within a reasonable 
time.


Background information: 


		On May 10, 2013, Mr. Musa Usman Ndamba was summoned to appear 
before the Court of First Instance in Bamenda, North Western Cameroon, 
following a complaint brought by Mr. Baba Ahmadou Danpullo for 
“propagating false information liable to injure public 
authorities”, “being a party in a judicial proceeding on oath 
and making false declarations”, “making a false report against 
Baba Ahmadou Danpullo liable to lead to his prosecution” and 
“injuring the reputation of Baba Ahmadou Danpullo by imputation of 
unprovable facts”. 

		 

		These charges stem from a false affidavit which the plaintiff alleged was 
signed by Mr. Musa Usman Ndamba.

		 

		During the hearing, Mr. Ndamba refuted all the allegations and pleaded not 
guilty. Mr. Ndamba was bailed, pending another hearing scheduled on May 27, 
2013. On that day, as the landowner failed to appear in court, the matter 
was adjourned to June 28, 2013, and the judge warned that he would award 
costs against the landowner should he fail again to attend court. 
Subsequently, in May 2014 the court dismissed the charges against Mr. Ndamba 
for lack of a diligent prosecution. 

		 

		On July 29, 2016, Mr. Baba Ahmadou Danpullo accused M. Ndamba of 
“propagation of false information, false oath, false report and 
defamation of character” based on the same affidavit and evidence as 
the case in 2013. Subsequently, the trial was adjourned several times in 
absence of the plaintiff. 

		 

		On December 18, 2017, the trial of Mr. Ndamba was adjourned for the 
fifty-fifth time.
 

		On February 23, 2018, the trial against Mr. Musa Usman Ndamba was resumed 
for the 57th time. The plaintiff Mr. Baba Ahmadou 
Danpullo was not present at the hearing and was represented by Mr. Sama 
Francis Asanga, a senior official from the opposition Social Democratic 
Party (SDF), close family member of the party leader Mr. John Fru Ndi and 
former President of the Cameroon Bar Association. On March 2, 2018, the 
Bamenda Court of First Instance presided by Magistrate Babila Tibet 
adjourned the next hearing to March 16, 2018.

		 

		On April 13, 2018, the plaintiff Mr. Baba Ahmadou Danpullo, was not 
present  at the hearing and was represented by Mr. Sama Francis Asanga, 
a senior  official of the opposition Social Democratic Party (SDF), 
close family member of the party leader Mr John Fru Ndi and former President 
of the Cameroon Bar Association.

		 

		On March 16, 2018, the trial was adjourned to April 6, 2018, because of 
the absence of the plaintiff’s witnesses. On April 6, 2018, the trial 
went ahead with one of the plaintiff’s and was adjourned again to 
April 13, 2018.
