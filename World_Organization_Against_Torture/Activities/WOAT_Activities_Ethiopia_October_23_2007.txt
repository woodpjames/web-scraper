According to the information received, Messrs. Anteneh Getnet, a member of the ETA Addis Ababa Regional Council, Meqcha Mengistu, local ETA chairperson in the East Gojjam area as well as a member of the ETA Committee responsible for the implementation of an HIV/AIDS education programme (EFAIDS), and Woldie Dana, another ETA leader, were arrested in May and June 2007[1]. In addition, Mrs. Wibit Legamo, the wife of Mr. Woldia Dana, and Mr. Berrhanu Aba-Debissa, another ETA member, were arrested in August 2007. They are all still being held in detention at the Kaliti Prison, in Addis Ababa, and would have been denied bail. In addition, they are reportedly due to appear in court on November 27, 28 and 29, 2007. They were allegedly accused of being members of the Ethiopian People’s Patriotic Front (EPPF), an armed opposition group. The Observatory fears for the physical and psychological integrity of Messrs. Anteneh Getnet, Meqcha Mengistu, Woldie Dana, Berrhanu Aba-Debissa and Mrs. Wibit Legamo as they are at risk of being subjected to torture or ill-treatment while in detention, and fears that the accusation against them might only aim at discrediting and sanctioning their activity in favour of human rights in Ethiopia. The Observatory indeed recalls that ETA members have been harassed and repressed for many years (see 2006 Annual Report of the Observatory). Background information: In December 2006, Messrs. Anteneh Getnet, Meqcha Mengistu and Woldie Dana, along with Mr. Tilahun Ayalew, another ETA official, had already been arrested[2], before being released in March 2007. They had also been accused of being members of the EPPF but a court had ruled on March 22, 2007 that it had found no evidence to support the charge. On May 28, 2007, Mr. Tilahun Ayalew went into hiding on hearing that government security agents were coming to arrest him. The agents arrested his wife instead, but released her the following day. Arrested in December 2006, without a warrant, he was transferred to the Addis Ababa Police Commission on December 26, 2006. On December 28, 2006, an Addis Ababa court ordered his release but the police rearrested him and he remained in detention until he was released on March 22, 2007. As a result of the torture he now has difficulty walking. Messrs. Anteneh Getnet and Meqcha Mengistu also reported that they were tortured during their previous detention, and claimed that they were coerced into signing false confessions that they had links with the EPPF. The court rejected these “confessions”, but did not investigate their allegations of torture. Actions requested: Please write to the authorities in Ethiopia, urging them to:  Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Messrs. Anteneh Getnet, Meqcha Mengistu, Woldie Dana, Berrhanu Aba-Debissa and Mrs. Wibit Legamo; Release them immediately and unconditionally as their detention is arbitrary as it merely aims at sanctioning their trade union activities; Put an end to all acts of harassment against all human rights defenders in Ethiopia; Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, especially its Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, and Article 12.2, which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”; Ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by Ethiopia.
