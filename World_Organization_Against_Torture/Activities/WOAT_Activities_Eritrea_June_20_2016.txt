To Permanent Representatives of
Members and Observer States of the
UN Human Rights Council Geneva, 20 June 2016
RE: Addressing human rights
violations in Eritrea and the UN Commission of Inquiry’s findings 
Your Excellency,
We, the undersigned civil society
organisations (CSOs), write to express our grave concern about the Eritrean
Government’s continued and egregious violations of human rights. We urge your
delegation to co-sponsor a resolution
renewing the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the human rights situation in
Eritrea and supporting the establishment of robust accountability mechanisms to
facilitate access to justice to the victims of human rights violations and
crimes against humanity in Eritrea during the 32nd session of
the United Nations Human Rights Council (UN HRC).  
The mandate of the UN
Commission of Inquiry (CoI) was established at the 26th session of
the UN HRC with a view to assess human rights violations documented by the
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Eritrea. [1]
The CoI’s mandate was extended at the 29th session and instructed to
“investigate systematic, widespread and gross violations of human rights in Eritrea
with a view to ensuring accountability, including where these violations may
amount to crimes against humanity.”[2]
On 8 June 2016, the CoI released
its second report, which states that “there are reasonable grounds to believe
that crimes against humanity have been committed in Eritrea since 1991,” and
that Eritrean government officials are responsible for crimes of enslavement,
imprisonment, enforced disappearance, torture, other inhumane acts,
persecution, rape and murder. [3]
The CoI further found that
there has been no change in Eritrea’s national service policy since the CoI’s establishment
in 2014, which includes the use of conscripts to carry out non-military work,
including for State-owned and other enterprises. The CoI secured evidence that
reprisals, including extrajudicial executions, for evasion of conscription
remain rampant. Most recently, on 3 April 2016, armed forces opened fire in the
centre of the capital Asmara, killing an unconfirmed number of young conscripts,
who were being transferred from Tessney to Massawa, and attempted to visit
their families while in Asmara. 
According to the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, an estimated 5,000 Eritreans flee the
country every month as a result of the dire human rights situation, some risking
their lives to escape to Europe despite the dangers and obstacles they face in
obtaining asylum.
Since June 2014, the
Eritrean Ministry of Information has refused to cooperate with the CoI while
publicly claiming that the CoI’s research constitutes a “campaign of unwarranted witch-hunting of Eritrea by an entity which
has clearly opted to instrumentalise human rights to serve political agendas.”[4]
In June 2015, the UN HRC’s President condemned attacks and intimidation perpetrated
against members of the CoI during their mission to Geneva.[5]
In light of the lack of adequate national mechanisms to address the CoI
findings and the Government of Eritrea’s claim that the report’s findings are “extreme and unfounded charges with
no solid and legal evidence to support its conclusion,”[6] it is incumbent upon the international community,
including the UN HRC, to facilitate access to justice for the victims of the
Eritrean Government’s grave and systematic violations of international human
rights law, including those amounting to crimes against humanity.
Therefore, we respectfully
request your delegation to co-sponsor a resolution during the 32nd
UN HRC session that:
-       Renews the mandate of the Special
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Eritrea for one year; provides
the mandate holder with the necessary human and financial resources; and
includes in her mandate the promotion of and reporting on the implementation of
the CoI’s recommendations; 
 
-       Supports the establishment
of a structure by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human
Rights with a protection and promotion mandate, to assist in ensuring
accountability for human rights violations in Eritrea, especially where such
violations amount to crimes against humanity;
 
-       Requests the High Commissioner for
Human Rights to report regularly on the situation of human rights in Eritrea;
and
 
-       Transmits the report of the CoI to
the UN General Assembly, the UN Security Council, and the UN Secretary-General.
 
Sincerely,
Amnesty
