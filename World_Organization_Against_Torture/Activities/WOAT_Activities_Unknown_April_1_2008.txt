An important objective for OMCT is to build partnerships with NGOs to work together on these issues over the long term. The seminar, in particular, will seek to:  help NGOs understand the various      ways violations of economic, social and cultural rights are linked to      violence and how acting on those root causes can reduce violence; help NGOs to develop their own      capacity to address the economic, social and cultural root causes of      violence; identify how action on the root      causes of violence could relate to the specific circumstances of the      participants’ countries; discuss proposals for  interventions (complaints)      presented by participants; discuss proposals from      participants for including in alternative reports to UN Treaty bodies and      in submissions to other institutions (for example the European Union) of      information on the link between the denial of economic, social and      cultural rights and torture along with recommendations for specific      action; and identify new and emerging issues      for attention.
