Description of the situation:  The Observatory has been informed by the Zimbabwe Human Rights Association (ZimRights) of new acts of repression against ZimRights members during the past week.  According to the information received, Ms. Sheba Phiri, ZimRights' Deputy National Chairperson, was arbitrarily arrested by plain clothes police on April 28, 2004, and detained at Bulawayo Central Police station. Police ransacked and searched every room of Ms. Phiri's apartment without a search warrant. The police took away reports, files and documents concerning ZimRights’ activities. Ms. Phiri is also an active member of Amnesty International and the National Constitutional Assembly (NCA), a collective of independent NGOs dedicated to the promotion of democracy and the rule of law in Zimbabwe. Documents related to the work of these organizations were also confiscated.  Ms. Phiri was arrested together with Mr. Felix Mafa (a member of Post-Independence Survivors Trust (PIST), an NGO that provides assistance to the victims of the "Gukurahundi" massacres of the early 1980s in Matabeleland and the Midlands provinces), Mr. Goden Moyo (an NCA member), Mr. Reggie Moyo (a member of Bulawayo Agenda, a pro-democracy Group in Bulawoyo), and two other persons.  All were detained and interrogated, and then released two hours later. The police informed the detainees that they could be summoned in the future.  Moreover, ZimRights Regional Officer in Masvingo, Ms Mabel Sikhosana, was arrested on April 27, 2004, and temporarily detained by Masvingo Police Officers for allegedly organizing a meeting without informing responsible authorities. However, according to the information received, Ms Mabel  has not organised any meeting.  The Observatory fears that these events are linked to the peaceful march in favour of democracy and constitutional reform that took place in Harare on April 28. Reportedly, Zimbabwean authorities often arrest and detain people whom they suspect will take part in peaceful demonstrations. During the April 28 march, NCA activists were attacked by the Zimbabwe Republic Police with baton sticks and riot gear. On the same day, 27 NCA activists from Mutare, who were on their way to the march, were - briefly detained on a Harare bound commuter train, interrogated and later released. No charges were brought against them.  In a separate incident on April 23, 2004, the house of Mr Arnold Tsunga, ZimRights National Chairman and Director of Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights (ZLHR), was broken into and computer diskettes and publications concerning ZimRights were stolen. However, no other valuables were stolen. Mr. Tsunga lodged a complaint with the local police in Harare and was told that an investigation would be  opened.  According to ZimRights, between January and April 2004, the ZimRights legal department received over 275 reports concerning acts of intimidation against opposition supporters, human rights defenders and activists at the hands of police, youths and militia groups that have been established in communities  around the country  to repress dissent.   The Observatory is deeply concerned over the persistence of such acts of repression against human rights defenders and civil society in Zimbabwe (see 2003 Observatory Annual Report, Observatory Evaluation Report "2003: Systematic repression of human rights defenders in Zimbabwe", February 2004 and joint Observatory/ZimRights Report “Onslaught Against Human Rights Defenders”, February 2003).  The Observatory notes that these acts of repression are in total disregard of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 9, 1998, in particular Article 5a which states that "[f]or the purpose of promoting and protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms, everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, at the national and international levels (…) [t]o meet or assemble peacefully", as well as article 12.2 which provides that "[t]he State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration".  Actions requested:  Please write to the authorities of Zimbabwe urging them to:  i.	end all forms of repression against ZimRights activists and all human rights defenders in Zimbabwe;  ii.	guarantee in all circumstances that human rights defenders and organisations are able to carry out their human rights work, including to demonstrate peacefully;  iii.	ensure an impartial and independent investigation into the search of Mr. Arnold Tsunga’s house, identify those responsible, bring them before a civil, competent and impartial tribunal and apply the penal and/or administrative sanctions provided by law;  iv.	ensure the implementation of the provisions on the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders adopted by the UN general Assembly on December 9, 1998, in particular article 1 which states that "[e]very person has the right, individually or collectively, to promote the protection and fulfilment of human rights and fundamental liberties at the national and international level", as well as articles 5a and 12.2 mentioned above;  v.	guarantee the respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and other international instruments  ratified by Zimbabwe.
