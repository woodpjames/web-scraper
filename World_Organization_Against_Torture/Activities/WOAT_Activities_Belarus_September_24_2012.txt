Administrative harassment
Belarus
September 24, 2012
 
The
Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of
the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation
Against Torture (OMCT), has received new information and requests your urgent
intervention in the following situation in Belarus.
 
New information:
 
The
Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the ongoing harassment
of Ms. Tatsiana Revyaka, Board member of the Human Rights Centre
“Viasna” and member of the Belarusian Human Rights House in exile.
 
According to the information received, on September
18, 2012, Ms. Revyaka received a notification from the Tax Inspection of Minsk
Pershamaiski District stating that she was “obliged to submit a declaration
of income and property not later than October 3, 2012 for the period of
2004-2010, in pursuance of Article 12 of the Law of the Republic of
Belarus 'On Declaration of Income and Property by Individuals'”.
 
The
Observatory strongly condemns this new act of harassment against Ms. Revyaka
(see background information), which is part of a more general campaign of
harassment against members of Viasna, since it seems to merely aim at impeding
their legitimate human rights activities.
 
The
Observatory is all the more concerned at this latest development, that the
authorities have been increasing tax-related harassment against some human
rights defenders in Belarus, by depicting them as tax offenders. In 2011, they
also adopted a set of provisions intended to facilitate the criminalisation of
legitimate human rights activities in the country in a context where the right
to freedom of association is regularly trampled. Tax-related harassment has
particularly intensified after Mr. Ales Bialiatski, Vice-President of
the FIDH and President of Viasna, was sentenced to four and a half years'
imprisonment and to heavy fines under abusive charges of alleged large-scale
tax fraud. 
 
Background information:
 
On August 17, 2012, Ms. Revyaka was summoned to the
KGB “as a person knowledgeable about the circumstances relevant to the national
security of the Republic of Belarus”. KGB officers interrogated her about a
publication on Viasna's website on August 15, 2012, titled “Mahiliou KGB
interferes with electoral process”. The officers showed her a printout from the
website charter97.org containing the same reprinted information under the
heading “Mogilev KGB terrorises collectors of signatures”. The officers also
inquired on the source of the information and its authors and asked her whether
she had checked the date mentioned in the article, arguing that publishing such
information without confirming it would discredit the state security of
Belarus. As a result, Ms. Revyaka was warned over the publication of unchecked
information on Viasna's website. However, despite these verbal criticisms, the
interrogators allegedly told Ms. Revyaka that the KGB had no legal motives to
open judicial proceedings against her.
 
The
said publication described how a KGB officer in Mogilev broke into the
apartment of Mr. Uladislau Yaroshau, a collector of signatures and student at
the Mogilev State University of Arkady Kuliashou, and tried to learn about how
much money he received for collecting signatures, and who managed the process.
He threatened to dismiss Mr. Yaroshau from the university for his work in the
team of an opposition candidate and proposed to him to cooperate with the KGB.
