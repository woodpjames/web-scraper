Brief description of the situation:The Observatory has been informed by the Forum of Conscience (FOC) about the death of Mr. Harry Yansaneh, former Acting Editor of the independent newspaper For di people, member of the Sierra Leone Chapter of Amnesty International and of the National League for Human Rights.  According to the information received, on May 10, 2005, Mr. Harry Yansaneh was beaten in his office in Freetown by a group of allegedly hired thugs and family members of Mrs. Fatmata Hassan, a Member of Parliament for the ruling Sierra Leone People’s Party (SLPP), a newly appointed member of the Parliament of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), as well as landlady of the building housing For di people. The group reportedly threatened to kill Mr. Yansaneh, and violently beat him, which resulted in excessive bleeding. They also vandalised the equipment of For di people when they sought to forcibly evict the newspaper from the office it had occupied over the last ten years. These events reportedly took place because of the criticism of the government the newspaper had regularly made.  On May 11, 2005, Mr. Yansaneh received medical treatment from the police doctor, but his health deteriorated a few weeks after. In early June he was admitted for eight days at the Cupid Hospital, in Freetown, and again on July 18, 2005, where he died on July 28, 2005. Although the official report on the reason for his death has not been made public yet, Mr. Harry Yansaneh reportedly died of kidney problems, probably due to complications from injuries sustained from his beating.  After his assault, Mr. Harry Yansaneh made a formal report to the Central Police Station in Freetown, and about a week after these events the Sierra Leone Association of journalist (SLAJ) made a formal complaint to the Ombudsman of Sierra Leone, Mr. Francis Gabidon, who referred the matter to the Speaker of Parliament for speedy investigation and appropriate actions. However, either the police or authorities failed to take necessary actions, although according to laws of Sierra Leone, the matter should have already been brought to Court.  According to the information received, on August 1, 2005, Mrs. Fatmata Hassan was invited by the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) of the Sierra Leone Police to make a statement on the circumstances surrounding Mr. Harry Yansaneh’s death, after which she was given police bail. According to the Law Officers Act of 1965 section 2 subsection 9, the Police had to inform the Attorney General before inviting the Parliamentarian.   Actions requested:Please write to the authorities of Sierra Leone and ask them to: i. Conduct a fair, impartial and independent inquiry into Mr. Harry Yansaneh’s death, in order to identify the perpetrators, bring them to justice and pronounce sentences proportional to the gravity of their crime;  ii. Ensure that Mr. Harry Yansaneh’s family receives adequate compensation;  iii. Guarantee under all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of all human rights defenders in Sierra Leone;  iv. Comply with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, in particular its article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually or in association with others, to promote the protection and realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels”, its article 9.3 (a), which provides that everyone has the right “to complain about the policies and actions of individual officials and governmental bodies with regard to violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms, by petition or other appropriate means, to competent domestic judicial, administrative or legislative authorities or any other competent authority provided for by the legal system of the State, which should render their decision on the complaint without undue delay”, and its article 12.2, which states that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”;  v.
