The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights
Defenders, a joint programme of the International Federation for Human Rights
(FIDH) and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), requests your urgent
intervention in the following situation in Bahrain.
Description of the situation:
The Observatory has been informed by reliable sources
about the judicial harassment and restrictions to freedom of movement Mr. Maytham Al Salman, a
human rights defender well known for his work promoting peaceful inter-faith dialogue, freedom of expression
and countering incitement to violence and discrimination. He is also an adviser
to the Columbia University's project “Global Freedom of Expression”[1]. 
According to information received, on August 8, 2015, Mr. Maytham Al
Salman was arrested in Manama airport upon his return to Bahrain after
attending a United Nations (UN) conference on hate-speech. He was held at the
Criminal Investigations Directorate (CID), Economic Crimes
Unit, for 12 hours, from where he was allowed to call his
family, but was denied access to a lawyer. He was charged with “inciting hatred
against the regime” (art. 165 of the Penal Code) and “disseminating false news”
(art. 168 of the Penal Code), and a travel ban was issued against him. He was
released later on the same day.
The charges against Mr. Al Salman are believed to be
related to some tweets that were published in Al Wasat newspaper on
August 2, calling on fighting all
forms of discrimination and denouncing violence and extremism in Bahrain[2].
The Observatory expresses its deepest concern about
the judicial harassment and restrictions to freedom of movement against Mr.
Maytham Al Salman, which seem to merely aim at sanctioning his human rights
activities. 
The Observatory calls for the unequivocal lift of his
travel ban, the dropping of all charges against him, and the end of all
harassment against him as well as against all human rights defenders in the
country.
The Observatory more generally recalls that similar
charges and travel bans have been widely used to target human rights defenders
in Bahrain[3].
Actions requested:
Please write to the authorities of Bahrain urging them
to: 
i.   
Immediately
drop all charges against Mr. Maytham Al Salman, as well as against all
criminalised human rights defenders in Bahrain;
ii.  
Immediately
revoke the travel ban against Mr. Maytham Al Salman, in order to
guarantee his freedom of movement;
iii. Put an end to any kind of harassment, including at
judicial level, against
Mr. Maytham Al Salman and all human rights defenders in Bahrain;
iv. Guarantee
in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Maytham Al
Salman; 
v.  
Conform with the
provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the
General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1998, in particular its:
- Article 1, which provides that “everyone has the right, individually
and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and
realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and
international levels”; 
- Article 6.c, which stipulates that everyone has the right [...] “to
study, discuss, form and hold opinions on the observance, both in law and in
practice, of all human rights and fundamental freedoms and, through these and
other appropriate means, to draw public attention to those matters”;
- as well as Article 12.2, which provides that “the State shall take all
necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of
everyone, individually or in association with others, against any violence,
threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or
any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise
of the rights referred to in the present Declaration”; 
vi.

[2]      The
tweets, written in Arabic, read as follows (unofficial translation): “National
responsibility calls on us to claim the consolidation of equal citizenship, to
fight against all forms of discrimination and to denounce violence and
extremism in Bahrain”. “Pejorative epithets against certain groups found
on some media and religious platforms perpetuate hostility in Bahrain. Anyone
hostile to Sunnis because they are Sunni, or Shiites because they are Shiite
cannot make any claim to good citizenship, which is grounded on civil
coexistence and the acceptance of diversity”. Mr. Al Salman also stated that
“monitoring speech and religious media platforms that call for hatred
against certain groups is of extreme importance to study the causes of the
perpetration of racism in Bahrain” and that “seriously resisting
national division and the promotion of hatred among citizens constitutes both a
national and a religious duty. And a must for Bahrain and the region”. For
