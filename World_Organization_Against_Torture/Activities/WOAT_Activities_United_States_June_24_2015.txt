Last December, the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence 
released the summary, findings and conclusions of its four-year 
investigation into the Detention and Interrogation Program operated by 
the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Since then, the international 
human rights community has reiterated the call for full transparency 
about and accountability for this unlawful program, in which systematic 
human rights violations, including the crimes under international law of
 torture and enforced disappearance were committed. Last March, more 
than 20 human rights groups called on the Council to take action and 
demand that the United States fulfill its international human rights 
obligations on truth, accountability and remedy, including by appointing
 a special prosecutor to conduct a comprehensive and credible criminal 
investigation of alleged serious crimes described in the report and to 
establish a special fund to compensate victims.
Last month, during the United States’ UPR session, a significant 
number of Member-States joined civil society’s call and raised the issue
 of accountability and reparations for the use of torture and other 
human rights violations in the context of U.S. counter-terrorism 
policies and practices.
They also emphasized the need to end indefinite detention and close 
the Guantánamo detention facility, one of the remaining examples of the 
unlawful actions taken in the name of national security since the 
attacks of 11 September 2001. Delivering justice for the victims and 
ending indefinite detention in Guantánamo are both issues that still 
require more decisive and urgent action from the Obama administration.
On 26 June, the world will mark the International Day in Support of 
Victims of Torture. The U.S. government was a strong supporter of the 
adoption of the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman 
or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (UNCAT), which is commemorated 
every year on this day. The United States is also a generous contributor
 to the U.N. Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture. But the U.S.’s 
failure to hold accountable those responsible for the CIA program of 
torture and enforced disappearance, to ensure the victims’ rights to 
truth and reparations, and to take other actions to ensure 
non-repetition of these heinous crimes leaves the U.S. in violation of 
its own obligations under UNCAT and other international instruments and 
is a serious blow to the international human rights system, in general, 
and to the global effort to eradicate torture and enforced 
disappearance, in particular.
During its next session, the Council will adopt the Working Group 
report on the U.S. UPR. We call on the Council to send a strong message 
against impunity for torture and enforced disappearances and demand that
 the United States take measures to meet the full spectrum of its 
obligations under international law to ensure accountability, 
transparency, reparations and non-repetition, including declassification
 of the full Senate report on the CIA detention program, independent 
comprehensive criminal investigation, and the issuing of apologies and 
compensation to victims of enforced disappearance, torture or other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.
Continued impunity is a dark chapter in the history of the United 
States that threatens to undermine the universally-recognized 
prohibition against torture and other abusive treatment, and sends the 
dangerous message to U.S. and foreign officials that there will be no 
consequences for future abuses. Other governments implicated in the CIA 
torture program must also be held accountable and are obligated to 
conduct independent investigations, hold perpetrators accountable, and 
provide effective remedies to victims of torture, enforced disappearance
 and other human rights violations.
We know from the experiences of civil society groups and survivors of
 torture around the world that the struggle for accountability for human
 rights violations and the search for truth can be a long and difficult 
journey. Yet the United States has much to gain from rejecting impunity,
 returning to the rule of law, and providing adequate redress to the 
dozens and dozens of people it so brutally abused.
We hope the United States will follow that path.
