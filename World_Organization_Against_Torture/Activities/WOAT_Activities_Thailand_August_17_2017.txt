The Observatory for the Protection of Human
Rights Defenders, a partnership of FIDH and the World Organisation Against
Torture (OMCT), has received new information and requests your urgent
intervention in the following situation in Thailand.
 
New information:
 
The Observatory has been informed by reliable
sources about the sentence against student and pro-democracy activist Mr. Jatuphat Boonpattaraksa (aka Pai), a
member of the Dao Din group[1]
and the New Democracy Movement (NDM)[2].
 
According to the information received, on August 15, 2017,
following a closed-door hearing, the Khon Kaen Provincial Court sentenced Mr.
Jatuphat to five years in prison under Article 112 of the Criminal Code
(lèse-majesté)[3]
for sharing on his Facebook page a profile of Thai King Maha Vajiralongkorn
Bodindradebayavarangkun, published on the British
Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) Thai language service’s website (see
background information).
 
The court reduced the sentence to two years and
six months in consideration of Mr. Jatuphat’s guilty plea[4].

 
Mr. Jatuphat has been arbitrarily detained in
Khon Kaen Prison since December 22, 2016 and denied bail on numerous occasions.
Furthermore, to date, Mr. Jatuphat is still facing several charges in other
ongoing cases (see background information).
 
The Observatory noted that, to date, Mr. Jatuphat is
the only individual who has been arrested and charged among the approximately
3,000 web users who shared the BBC
profile of the Thai King on Facebook. It is believed that the charges against
him are aimed at punishing him for his legitimate human rights activities and
silencing dissident critical voices in Thailand.
 
The Observatory condemns the conviction,
imprisonment, and ongoing judicial harassment of Mr. Jatuphat and urges the
Thai authorities to immediately release him and drop all charges against him. 
 
Background information:
 
On December 3, 2016, Mr. Jatuphat Boonpattaraksa
was arrested for sharing on Facebook a profile of Thai King Maha Vajiralongkorn
Bodindradebayavarangkun, published on the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) Thai language service’s
website on December 2, 2016. 
 
The following day, Mr. Jatuphat was released on
a 400,000 Thai baht (approx. 10,620 Euros) bail. 
 
However, on December 22, 2016, the Khon Kaen
Provincial Court approved a police request to revoke Mr. Jatuphat’s bail after
he posted a sarcastic Facebook message that read: “The economy is poor so they
[the authorities] took my bail money”. Since then, Mr. Jatuphat has been
detained in Khon Kaen Provincial Correctional Institution.
 
The Observatory was also informed about abusive
cavity searches to which Mr. Jatuphat has been subjected on several occasions
after returning to Khon Kaen Provincial Correctional Institution from court
hearings.
 
Mr. Jatuphat
has faced arrest and legal action on numerous occasions in connection with his
participation in peaceful pro-democracy activities. On November 19, 2014, Mr.
Jatuphat and four other student activists were arrested by police and
subsequently detained by the military for several hours for staging a silent
protest and flashing a defiant three-finger salute while junta head General
Prayuth Chan-ocha was delivering a speech during an official visit to Khon
Kaen.
 
On May 22,
2015, police arrested Mr. Jatuphat along with six fellow members of the ‘Dao
Din’ group for staging a peaceful anti-junta demonstration to mark the one-year
anniversary of the military coup at Khon Kaen Democracy Monument. All seven
were released on bail the next day after being charged with violating National
Council for Peace and Order (NCPO) Order 3/2015, which bans political
gatherings of more than four people. If convicted by a military court, they
could face prison terms of up to six months or a 10,000 Thai baht (approx. 265
Euros) fine.
 
On June 26,
2015, police arrested Mr. Jatuphat along with 13 other student activists for an
anti-junta peaceful demonstration at Bangkok’s Democracy Monument a day
earlier. The 14 activists were released
by the Bangkok Military Court on July 8, 2015 after being charged with violating NCPO Order 3/2015
and Article 116 of the Criminal Code (‘sedition’).
If convicted under Article 116, Mr. Jatuphat faces up to seven years in prison.
 
Mr. Jatuphat
is facing additional charges under NCPO Order 3/2015 for organizing a public
discussion on Thailand’s 2017 constitution at Khon Kaen University on July 31,
2016.
 
On August 6, 2016, Mr. Jatuphat was arrested in
Chaiyaphum Province for distributing leaflets that urged voters to reject the
junta-backed constitution in the August 7, 2016 referendum. He was released on
August 19, 2016, after being charged with violating Article 61 of the 2016
Referendum Act. If convicted, he could face up to 10 years in prison, a fine of
up to 200,000 baht (approx. 5,310 Euros), and the revocation of his voting
rights for a period of up to 10 years.
 
To date, all the above mentioned cases are
ongoing and Mr. Jatuphat is still facing all the above mentioned charges.
 
Actions requested:
 
Please write
to the Thai authorities asking them to:
 
i. Guarantee in all circumstances the
physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Jatuphat Boonpattaraksa, as well as that of all
human rights defenders in Thailand;
 
ii. Immediately
and unconditionally release Mr. Jatuphat Boonpattaraksa as his detention is
arbitrary since it only seems to aim at punishing him for his human rights
activities;
 
iii. Put
an end to any kind of harassment – including at the judicial level – against
Mr. Jatuphat Boonpattaraksa, as well as all other human rights defenders in
Thailand;
 
iv. Conform with the provisions of the UN Declaration on
Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations
on December 9, 1998, in particular with its Articles 1, 6, 9, and 12.2;
 
v. Ensure in all circumstances respect
for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international
human rights standards and international instruments ratified by Thailand.
