CC Violence against Women / Child Concern Lack of due diligence by police   The International Secretariat of OMCT request your URGENT  intervention in the following situation in Sri Lanka.  New Information  The International Secretariat of OMCT has received new information  from the Asian Human Rights Commission, a member of the OMCT network,  about the lack of due diligence by the police in the investigation in  the case of a 16-year-old girl who has been a victim of a gang rape  in Kengalle Digana, Kandy, Sri Lanka.   According to the new information received, none of the alleged  perpetrators have been arrested. David Kaiser and his uncle  Ravinathan, two of the alleged perpetrators, have left the country  before the police raided their house. The investigation in this case  has not been completed by the police. Moreover, despite the report of  the case to the National Human Rights Commission by the victim,  allegedly no investigation has been conducted. OMCT expresses its grave concern over the lack of willingness by the  police to conduct an adequate investigation into the crime. OMCT  would like to remind the authorities of Sri Lanka that the  Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women, in article  4(c), states that States should "exercise due diligence to prevent,  investigate and, in accordance with national legislation, punish acts  of violence against women, whether those acts are perpetrated by the  State or by private persons." OMCT also wishes to recall that Sri  Lanka, as a State party to the Convention on the Rights of the Child,  is bound to "protect the child from all forms of sexual exploitation  and sexual abuse" (article 34). Reminder of the situation  On February 23rd 2003, Mr Kaiser's car hit the victim's hand when she  was going to a computer class. Thereafter the alleged perpetrator  called the victim several times on the pretext of knowing about her  condition and met her twice when she was going to class.  When he met the victim on July 2nd, 2003, he offered her a drink. But  as soon as she drank it, she felt dizzy and wanted to go home. Mr.  Kaiser offered her a lift and pushed her into a van. Then, he took  her to a house in Kengalle Digana, where he raped her and then his  uncle Ravinathan also raped her. She was kept in that house the whole  night and raped by at least 5-6 individuals.  On the morning of July 3rd, the girl was taken back to Peradeniya  town and abandoned on the street. After she managed to go home alone,  she was immediately taken to the Peradeniya Police Station by her  mother, in order to lodge a complaint. But after having listened to  the story, the police asked them to go to the Kandy Police Station,  where they could finally file a complaint. The same day, the victim,  her mother and her aunt, accompanied by the police, went looking for  David Kaiser and Ravinathan.   On July 4th, the girl identified the house where she had been raped.  Later in the day, she was admitted to the Kandy Hospital, where she  had to stay until July 10th, 2003. When she left the hospital, the  Kandy police asked her to go to the police station and to write down  a statement. There, Officer Abeysinghe and the Office in Charge (OIC)  of the crime, Mr. Dharmaratne, tried to force her to change her  statement, in order to arrange the victim's marriage to Mr  Ravinathan. But as she did not agree to do so and repeated the same  complaint, the police just omitted certain parts of it.   During an identification parade on the 6th of August, the girl  identified Mr. Wasana and Mr. Prithi, two men who had allegedly been  in the van in which she had been taken away. Both of them were  arrested, but were soon released on bail.   Further, according to the victim, on July 3rd and July 11th the  police asked the victim's mother for money in exchange for the  attempt to arrest David Kaiser and his uncle Ravinathan. There is  concern that, at this date, David and Ravinathan had already fled the  country. Finally, the police would have told the victim that it was  useless trying to arrest them, and that they could not be brought to  justice because they were wealthy.    Actions requested  Please write to the authorities in Sri Lanka urging them to:  i.	take all necessary measures to guarantee the physical and  psychological integrity of  the girl and intervene with the  appropriate authorities in order to ensure that the adequate medical  assistance is provided; ii.	order a thorough and impartial investigation into this rape case,  in order to identify all the responsible parties, bring them to trial  and apply penal sanctions as provided for by law;  iii.	undertake particular efforts in order to determine the  whereabouts of Mr. David Kaiser and his uncle Ravinathan and to  request their extradition from a third country; iv.	order an impartial investigation into the allegation of lack of  due diligence by the police, in order to identify those responsible  and apply the penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions as  provided for by law; v.	guarantee adequate reparation to the girl; vi.	guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental  freedoms throughout Sri Lanka in accordance with international human  rights standards.
