Brief description of the facts:  The Observatory has been informed by the Sudan Organization Against  Torture (SOAT), of the arrest on 2 July, by the National Security  Agency (NSA), of Gazi Suliman, a lawyer and Chairperson of the Sudan  Human Rights Group.   According to the information received, Mr. Suliman was arrested from  his home at 8 am by a number of individuals from the NSA. He was then  transported to the NSA Political section near Al- Faroq cemetery  where he was questioned about the Khartoum Declaration (E'laan El  Khartoum'). This document was signed by 18 leading political parties,  14 civil society groups and 78 prominent individuals in support of  the IGAD Peace Process , the Machakos Protocol (July 2002) and the  Cairo Declaration, calling for Khartoum to become the national   "secular" capital of Sudan, respecting the diversity of Sudanese  citizens irrespective of race, gender, religion or political  affiliation.   Mr. Suliman was also interrogated on the subject of the press  conference that was scheduled to be held at his office later that day  to officially announce the signing of the Khartoum Declaration.  However, NSA officers surrounded the office in an attempt to prevent  the press conference from taking place, detaining all those who were  present for one hour before transferring them to NSA headquarters and  releasing them later on in the day.  At 10 am, following two hours of interrogation, Mr. Suliman was  returned to his home for the purpose of collecting a small number of  personal belongings and to inform his family that he was being taken  to Kober Prison, before he was taken away once more by NSA officers.  Since this time, family members have visited both Kober Prison and  NSA headquarters demanding to see Mr. Suliman, only to be told that  he is not being held at either of those places.  The Observatory is extremely concerned by the arrest and further  disappearance of Mr. Suliman and fears for his physical and  psychological integrity.  The Observatory recalls that Mr. Gazi Suliman was detained during 3  months from December 2000 to February 2001 for defending political  opponents as a lawyer, and was again arrested one day in May 2002  during which he was questioned on his activities and requested to  dissolve SVTG (See annual reports 2001 and 2002 of the Observatory).   Action requested:  Please write to the authorities of Sudan urging them to:  §   take all measures to find the whereabouts of Mr. Gazi Suliman,  release him and guarantee his physical and psychological integrity; §   put an end to any kind of repression and intimidation against human  rights lawyers in Sudan; §   order an immediate investigation into his disappearance, in order  to identify those responsible, bring them to trial ans apply the  penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions as provided by law; §   conform to the provisions of the Declaration on Humans Rights  Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on  December 9, 1998, in particular article 1, which states that  "everyone has the right, individually or in association with others,  to promote the protection and realization of human rights and  fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels";  article 12.2 which provides that "the State shall take all necessary  measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of  everyone, individually or in association with others, against any  violence, threats, retaliation, de facto o de jure adverse  discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a  consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred  to in the present Declaration."; §   ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and  fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights  standards.
