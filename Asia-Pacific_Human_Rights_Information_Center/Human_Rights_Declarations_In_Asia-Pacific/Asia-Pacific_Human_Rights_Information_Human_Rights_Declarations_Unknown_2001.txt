Osaka City University Declaration of Human Rights 2001
2001
(Adopted by the University Council on 17 December 2001 and revised on 17 May 2010)PreambleHuman beings are born free, being equal in dignity and rights. Since the enactment of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, each of us has been expected to live with people from around the world, respecting human rights and fundamental freedoms. Nevertheless, discrimination persists regarding characteristics such as social status, descent, race, ethnicity, belief, sex, and disability. Furthermore, we are confronting new human rights issues caused by rapid social change as well as technological and scientific advance.Osaka is a city in which historically different cultures have developed, evolving in unique fashion through respect for freedom and the spirit of coexistence. Being a major center for international exchange in East Asia, the city welcomes people from all parts of the world. The diversity of its people encourages an ever-rising awareness of dignity and human rights.Osaka City University has created an academic tradition of respecting human rights and fundamental freedoms supported by respect for freedom and the spirit of coexistence of the people of Osaka City. The University has held lectures on human rights issues since 1968, and in 1973 established the Dowa Mondai Research Institute (currently, Research Center for Human Rights). The Center was Japan's first academic research institute on human rights issues, and remains a leader in education and research on eliminating discrimination and protecting human rights.Osaka City University is a seat of learning based on the dignity of people and the spirit of equality. In the 20th century, the results of academic research were often used, serving as tools or justification for instigating wars and violating human rights. We, however, shall turn once again to the basic ideas of fundamental human rights, the dignity of human beings, and equal rights of men and women, utilizing academic research to promote peace and respect for human rights.
