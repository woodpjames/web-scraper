1998
Declaration of the International Conference on Human Rights Education
  in the Asia-Pacific Region
  November 25-27, 1998, Osaka, JapanSupporting the United Nations
Decade for Human Rights Education (1995-2004) which promotes human rights education
all around the world, and re-affirming the recommendations and calls to action
in the Conference-Workshop on Asia-Pacific Human Rights Education for Development
(Manila, 1995) and the Workshop on Asia-Pacific Human Rights Education: Tasks
for the UN Decade for Human Rights Education in the Asia-Pacific Region (Sydney,
1996);Emphasizing the importance of the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights which guided efforts during the last 50 years towards
universal realization of human rights and stimulated the adoption of many international
human rights instruments;Considering all the international
human rights instruments which clearly set out our rights as persons and as peoples,
and prohibit all forms of discrimination against women, indigenous peoples, untouchables,
Buraku and other minorities, people with different abilities, foreigners, immigrants
and migrant workers, the elderly, children and victims of HIV/AIDS;Considering the situation in
the Asia-Pacific where many countries still suffer from the damage brought about
by armed conflicts, religious conflicts, colonial rule and invasion, where many
people suffer from dictatorship, where traditional practices in conflict with
human rights dominate many societies, where ethnic conflicts are aggravated by
globalization, where discrimination based on caste continues, and where xenophobia
and racism are rampant;Being concerned about the abuse
of power by law enforcement agencies, military and paramilitary forces in many
countries in the region;Being concerned about the hardships
and persistent discrimination that all oppressed people in the region face, especially
women, children, minorities, indigenous peoples, untouchables, immigrants and
migrant workers;Being concerned that such hardships
have been exacerbated by the emphasis of several governments on economic growth
at the expense of human rights and environment, and by the current economic crisis
in the region resulting in a widening gap between the rich and the poor;Being concerned about the hypocrisy
of the so-called Asian values promoted by some Asian government leaders, the
lack of attention to positive local traditional values, the manipulation of religion
by political and social institutions, and the hegemonic use of human rights for
political purposes which result in selective application of human rights standards;Being also concerned about
the absence, or lack of implementation, in most countries in the region, of national
action plans called for by the UN General Assembly and the Plan of Action for
the UN Decade, the lack of human rights curriculum in most institutions of formal
education and in programmes of non-formal education, and the lack of awareness
by many people of their own human rights guaranteed by the international human
rights law and their own national constitutions and laws;Recognizing the importance
of human rights education as a strategy to address the abovementioned problems
in the Asia-Pacific region notably inter-related problems of globalization, discrimination
and oppression;Noting the need for integrating
ideas of sustainable development and other global issues into human rights education;Recognizing the efforts of
many groups in the region who believe in the inherent power of people and therefore
adopt participatory human rights education approaches to conscienticize and bring
out the creativity of people, and to make political leaders accountable to their
responsibilities, obligations and commitments to achieve universal realization
of human rights;The participants of the International Conference on Human
Rights Education in the Asia-Pacific Region declare that:1. All forms of discrimination
against women, indigenous peoples, untouchables, Buraku and other minorities,
people with different abilities, foreigners, immigrants and migrant workers,
the elderly, children and victims of HIV/AIDS should be eradicated not only in
the field of education but in other fields as well. Their own culture and identity
should be affirmed. The principle of unity in diversity should be promoted, and
structural and subjective causes of discrimination should be challenged;2. Since popular human rights
education has often arisen in response to violations of human rights at the grassroots
level, learning from the reality of human rights violations is an imperative
need. Human rights education should be relevant to the lives and the realities
of the community;3. All governments in the region
must ratify and implement international human rights instruments in fulfillment
of the commitments they made in the United Nations World Conference on Human
Rights held in Vienna;4. Governments must develop
programmes with an integral human rights empowerment focus for the oppressed
as well as literacy and basic education programs for all. Non-discriminatory
ecological and development education perspectives should be incorporated in these
programmes. Such programmes should include the pedagogy of the oppressed and
adopt participatory approaches;5. Governments must provide
human rights training for the military and paramilitary forces, law enforcement
agency officers, and prison officials as a matter of highest priority;6. Governments should facilitate
human rights training for government officials notably immigration and border
officials, members of legislative bodies and local authorities;7. Professional groups, notably
journalists and the medical and legal professions, should assume responsibility
for enhancing human rights awareness of their members, and ensuring that their
conduct conforms to human rights standards;8. All schools - public and
private - should place emphasis on human rights as an integral part of the curriculum
as well as as separate subject in its own right. All school authorities should
provide a learning environment free from intimidation and discrimination which
fosters participation and respect for human dignity;9. Human rights education in
the region will be further strengthened by cooperation with the United Nations:
