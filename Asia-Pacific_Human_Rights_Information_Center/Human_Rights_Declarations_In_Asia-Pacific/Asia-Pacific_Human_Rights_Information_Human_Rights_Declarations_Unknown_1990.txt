The Member States of the Organization
of the Islamic Conference,Reaffirming the civilizing and
historical role of the Islamic Ummah which God made the best nation that has
given mankind a universal and well-balanced civilization in which harmony is
established between this life and the hereafter and knowledge is combined with
faith; and the role that this Ummah should play to guide a humanity confused
by competing trends and ideologies and to provide solutions to the chronic problems
of this materialistic civilization.Wishing to contribute to the
efforts of mankind to assert human rights, to protect man from exploitation and
persecution, and to affirm his freedom and right to a dignified life in accordance
with the Islamic Shari'ahConvinced that mankind which

in dire need of faith to support its civilization and of a self-motivating force
to guard its rights;Believing that fundamental rights
and universal freedoms in Islam are an integral part of the Islamic religion
and that no one as a matter of principle has the right to suspend them in whole
or in part or violate or ignore them in as much as they are binding divine commandments,
which are contained in the Revealed Books of God and were sent through the last
of His Prophets to complete the preceding divine messages thereby making their
observance an act of worship and their neglect or violation an abominable sin,

responsible -- for their safeguard.Proceeding from the above-mentioned
