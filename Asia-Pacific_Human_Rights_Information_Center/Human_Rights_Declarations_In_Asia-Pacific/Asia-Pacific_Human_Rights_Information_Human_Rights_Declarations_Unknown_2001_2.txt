Declaration of the Asia-Pacific NGO Forum
2001
Tehran, Iran
17-18 February 2001PreambleWe, the representatives of Asian and Pacific
Non-Governmental Organisations and other national, regional and international
civil society organisations, meeting in Tehran, Iran, during February 18-19,
2001 in preparation for the World Conference Against Racism, Racial Discrimination,
Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, to be held in South Africa in accordance
with the UN General Assembly Resolution 52/111,Reaffirming that
all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and inalienable,
irrespective of distinction of any kind such as race, colour, sex, gender, language,
national or ethnic identity, caste, descent, religion, social origin, disability,
sexual orientation, age and other factors;Recognisingthat
all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights, and have the
capacity to contribute constructively to the development and well-being of their
societies and, that all human societies, including those of the Asia Pacific
region, are based on the shared values of tolerance, solidarity and pluralism;;Noting with concern,
the persistence and increasing spread of various forms of racism, racial and
ethnic discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance in all continents and
regions of the world;Declare that
racism is an ideological construct that assigns a certain social group to a position
of power over others on the basis of a notion of superiority, dominance and purity,and
that it is 'scientifically false, morally condemnable, socially unjust and dangerous'.Further declare that racism is the basis of
gross violations of human rights and occurs in the form of unjust exploitation,
marginalisation, exclusion, pauperisation, ethnic cleansing and genocide, constituting
a threat to peace and development of all human societies and, therefore, must
be addressed with all appropriate resources and means, including legal mechanisms.Consider that
the roots of many contemporary manifestations of racism and racial discrimination
can be located in the legacy of colonialism which created historical injustices
based on ideologies of superiority, dominance and purity.Recall that
some of the worst manifestations of racism and racial discrimination have been
caused by colonialism and foreign domination and express grave concern regarding
the continued occupation of Palestine.The Asia-Pacific region is rich with a diversity
of cultures, languages, religions and peoples. However, the nation-building process
in the region has resulted in some groups being rendered stateless, refugees,
internally displaced persons and migrants and in discrimination against their
cultures, languages, and religions. Today, many states in the Asia Pacific region
are facing the threat of disintegration due to racial, caste-based, ethnic and
other forms of discrimination and intolerance.It is important to recognise that many conflicts
in the region, and around the world, are caused by racism, racial and ethnic
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and that therefore elimination
of all forms of racism, racial and ethnic discrimination, xenophobia and related
intolerance is essential for creating peace and establishing respect for human
rights.The processes of globalization that include
economic policies which exploit and appropriate local economies and force the
implementation of structural adjustment programs actually heightened racism,
racial and ethnic discrimination, xenophobia and intolerance.Governments have a responsibility in the elimination
of structural and institutional racism and discrimination on the basis of race,
caste, colour, sex, descent, occupation, ethnic origin, national origin and other
factors if we are to achieve respect and equality for all human rights for all.Racism, racial and ethnic discrimination, xenophobia
and related intolerance have a special and heightened impact on individuals,
groups and communities that are already disadvantaged and vulnerable to abuse,
oppression and exploitation including women, young people, children, people with
disabilities, people living with HIV/AIDS, documented and undocumented migrants,
refugees and internally displaced persons, indigenous and tribal peoples and
trafficked persons.It is also important to recognise that patriarchal
social structures reinforce all forms of discrimination against women. Racism
also creates new forms of patriarchal subordination of women.We wish to congratulate the people of East Timor
for their successful struggle for self-determination and independence; We also
extend our solidarity to the peoples' struggles for self-determination in West
Papua, Aceh, Bougainville, the north-east of India, in Sri Lanka and elsewhere
in the region;,We also wish to endorse the Declarations coming
out of the NGO Forums in Santiago de Chile Dakar, Senegal and Strasbourg, France,
in particular the affirmation that 'diversity is a social, political and cultural
reality, and that recognition and respect for difference is fundamental to the
construction of democratic coexistence' (Santiago) and the denunciation of environmental
racism including environmental deterioration represented by dumping of toxic
wastes, dangerous work conditions, and dangerous and unregulated methods of extracting
natural resources' (Dakar);Racism in the Global
ContextGlobalization describes the ever-increasing
integration of human society at economic, social, cultural and political levels.
It historically derives from the process of colonial integration of the world.
Globalization is therefore an iniquitous structure, one that is based on unequal
power relations. It has promoted an institutional racism at both the national
and international level.At one level, globalization has seen the continuation
of the domination of one-time colonial powers together with newly established
economic 'big powers' over the world system. At another level, the global order
of nation states has seen the emergence of a multitude of nationalisms from which
have developed a number of instances of ethnic hegemonisms. This has resulted
in the creation of ethnic exclusivist states.At the global level, we see the iniquity of
this system within the international community, for example in the United Nations
and in the international financial institutions in which the globally dominant
powers retain control. The political structures that are required to facilitate
the free flow of capital and unregulated financial speculation are themselves
authoritarian and have led to repression, exclusion, intolerance and violence.This global hegemony by the metropolitan powers
has resulted in the continuing domination of European-originated cultures and
the marginalization of other world civilizations. The current strategies of the
global big powers contribute to create a pervasive culture of racism, one example
being Islamophobia. Xenophobia and intolerance is sharply reflected in the global
mass media, for example, in its racist bias in the reporting of the Palestinian
problem and its coverage of the aggression against Iraq.This iniquitous global system has its ramifications
in its impact on the entirety of human society but more especially on the numerous
sectors of people most adversely affected. Racism, discrimination and intolerance
are but one aspect of this impact and affect various social sectors.The Asia Pacific NGO Forum focussed on sub-themes
important and relevant to the Asia Pacific region and also on the impact of racism,
racial and ethnic discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance on specific
groups, such as women, Dalits, Burakumin, indigenous peoples, documented and
undocumented migrants, migrant workers, trafficked persons, refugees, displaced
persons, and people living under foreign occupation.Gender and Racism:Issues of racism, racial and ethnic discrimination,
xenophobia and related intolerance must be approached within the context of an
understanding of the inter-sectionality of all forms of discrimination, including
gender.We recognise the specific impact of racism,
racial and ethnic discrimination, and all other forms of discrimination on the
human rights of women, specifically women belonging to marginalised and minority
communities, and that all forms of violence against women are heightened by racism,
caste-based, racial and ethnic discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance.An urgent problem created by the growth of conflict
is the increase of all forms of violence, including sexual violence against women.
Intolerance in the context of conflict places many restrictions on women's freedom
and mobility.One major manifestation of racism, racial and
ethnic discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance is a denial of women's
right to make decisions regarding their reproductive capacities.Caste is descent-based and hereditary in nature,
determined by one's birth into a particular caste. Caste and descent-based discrimination
affects nearly 240 million people in the Asia Pacific region, for example Dalits
in India and Nepal and Burakamin in Japan, irrespective of the faith that they
practice."Untouchability" is the most insidious manifestation
of caste-based discrimination in the Asia Pacific region, specifically in India
and Nepal. Caste-based discrimination de facto denies access to public services
including housing, education, health, land, employment, social services and other
resources normally available to citizens of a country as a right.The grave lack of legal protection for persons
who suffer caste-based discrimination places restrictions on their enjoyment
of rights as well as on their social and economic mobility and makes them more
vulnerable to all forms of violence.Even though states enact laws to protect the
rights of marginalized communities, it is the states themselves who often violate
these laws;All forms of colonisation, state legislation,
and foreign domination are manifestations of institutionalised racism. Such racism
denies indigenous peoples the inherent right to self-determination.Such denial constitutes the non-recognition
of the rights of indigenous peoples to have control over their territories, resulting
in the dispossession, confiscation and appropriation of their resources;Race-based discrimination leaves indigenous
peoples suffering the loss of identity, culture, dignity and life resulting from
the destruction of their social structures and communities.Members of indigenous peoples face extreme forms
of oppression and violence from military forces due to the militarisation of
their territories. Racism and discrimination against indigenous peoples also
manifests itself in the policies of government institutions and authorities and
the practice of police brutality, and a lack of effective protection and remedies
from judicial institutions and authorities of governments.Race-based and other forms of discrimination
against groups that are defined as minorities are historical and complex and
deny their right to self determination.This denial has political, social, cultural
and economic dimensions such as denial of political power, poverty, uneven regional
development, unequal access to education, employment, land and other resources
and unequal treatment in terms of use of language;Racial discrimination is not about numbers or
size but essentially about vulnerability. Majority groups also face discrimination
when they are similarly vulnerable.Affirmative action is a method of redressing
historical injustices and has often been used to advance the cause of minority
communities. Regrettably, it is sometimes used by states to promote majoritarian
ethno-nationalism, as in Malaysia and Sri Lanka.In the Asia Pacific region numerous minorities
and marginalised communities have been subject to various forms of racism and
institutionalised discrimination including
denial of citizenship, state colonisation, forced population transfer, ethnic
cleansing and political repression. The nation-state structures that are majoritarian
deny the right of minority communities to full enjoyment of their democratic
rights, including the right to self-determination and to an equal share of power.This has given rise to intra- and inter-state
conflicts, including armed conflicts, in the Asia Pacific region causing militarisation
of state and civil society, political repression, and social destruction, including
internal displacement and the creation of new refugee populations. In these conflicts
both, state and non-state actors, perpetrate acts of discrimination and other
human rights violations.People under foreign occupation,
refugees, and internally displaced peopleForeign occupation creates an environment in
which the occupied people are exposed to a wide range of violence. While the
case of Palestine is the most serious problem of foreign occupation in our region,
the situation of the Tibetan people is also of great concern.The issue of the continuing subjugation of the
Palestinian people is a threat to the security and stability of our entire region.
The social, cultural, economic and political pressures which the Palestinian
people suffer under the racist policies of the Israeli government are an extreme
form of racism and discrimination.Throughout the Asia-Pacific region, political
tensions, internal conflicts and economic deprivation are resulting in an increase
in the numbers of refugees and internally displaced persons.State policies that implement population transfers
aimed at altering demographic patterns in a particular region further intensify
the discrimination suffered by these populations.Refugees and asylum seekers in countries outside
their country of origin face problems of discrimination based on their ethnic
and racial identity and their status of displaced people.Internally displaced people are also often victims
of racial and ethnic discrimination, and are deprived of their basic rights as
citizens. The condition of these displaced populations is a constant reminder
of the urgent need to resolve these conflicts so that these communities may return.The restructuring of the global
economy facilitates the movement of capital across national borders but restricts
and controls that of labour. This feature exacerbates regional economic inequalities
and the demand for the cheapest, most flexible and deregulated labour, has become
a major contributing factor to international migration. This process has resulted
in the outflow of millions of workers, including large numbers of women, from
the less developed to the more developed countries within and outside the region.The discrimination experienced
by most migrant workers, is manifested in restrictive immigration and labor laws
and policies; the denial of trade union rights; exploitative working conditions,
low wages and non-payment of wages; lack of access to public services such as
health, housing and social security. In this context women migrant workers experience
multiple forms of discrimination.The large-scale movement of
persons using legal and non-legal methods is another phenomenon that gives rise
to various manifestations of racism, racial discrimination and xenophobia. Trafficking
in persons for the exploitation of their labour and sexuality has been described
as a contemporary form of slavery. Another major phenomenon in migration is the
organised movement of displaced persons and asylum seekers which is often described
as human smuggling or migrant smuggling.Race-based discrimination against
documented and undocumented migrants, migrant workers and trafficked persons
is structural in nature and contravene international standards. These persons
suffer gross violations of their human rights due to the lack of legal protection
and redress mechanisms, and are vulnerable to a range of abuse and violence.
Legal and policy frameworks that enable states to make a distinction between
citizens and non-citizens in terms of enjoyment of rights lay the foundation
for these forms of discrimination.The commodification of women
within the international labour market which confines women to certain specific
sectors of employment such as the entertainment industry and domestic work, is
a reflection of patriarchal, sexist and discriminatory ideologies.ConclusionThe major and critical problems
referred to above challenge us to initiate a global effort to combat racism at
the cultural, structural and institutional levels. We call for a comprehensive
and intensive set of programs at the level of the United Nations and other international,
regional, and national levels. All members of the United Nations should jointly
develop a common plan of action to eliminate all forms of discrimination with
their own discriminatory practices being the first priority. Combating racism
and discrimination calls for the creation and strengthening of alliances among
various sectors and groups of people who are the victims of globalization and
racism. It also calls for better links between these groups and other civil society
actors. More equitable structures should replace the neo-liberal hegemonic global
political-economic structures. A dialogue of civilisations should replace the
clash of civilisations.Recommendations of the Asia Pacific
