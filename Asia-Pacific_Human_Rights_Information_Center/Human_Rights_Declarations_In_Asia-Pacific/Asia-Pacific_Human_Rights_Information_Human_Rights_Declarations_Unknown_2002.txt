Bhopal Declaration
2002
Adopted UnanimouslyByThe Bhopal Conference: Charting
A New Course For Dalits For The 21st CenturyHeld at Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh,
India, 12-13 January 2002We-- intellectuals and activists
assembled at the Bhopal Conference, 12-13 January 2002, to deliberate the issues
concerning the welfare of and justice to the 250 million --are:Declaring our belief in Babasaheb Dr. B.
R. Ambedkar's ideal of Social Democracy and his prophecy that, "A democratic
form of Government presupposes a democratic form of society. The formal framework
of democracy is of no value and would indeed be a misfit if there was no social
democracy",Endorsing the ideals of civil society enshrined
in the Constitution of India, particularly its Preamble that declares the Indian
State's commitment to Justice, Liberty, Equality and Fraternity,Recognising that the tenets established by
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and various other charters of the United
Nations which our nation has acceded to also emphasise the same principles,Recognising also the tribals' legitimate
and historical rights over forest and forest-produce,Acknowledging the role of tribal communities,
particularly tribal women, to the protection and conservation of the country's
rich biodiversity and natural resources as well as its culture and civilisationAcknowledging also the need to ensure that
SCs and STs are given due representation in all bodies of decision making,Recalling the struggles that Babasaheb had
waged for the emancipation of his people and the historic rights he had won for
them,Mindful of the fact that even after 54 years
of Independence, the Dalit community is denied of its basic human rights and
is also at the receiving end of the most brutal and oppressive forms of discrimination
and exclusion,Reaffirming that concerted action by society
as a whole - especially coordination among the political leadership, officials
and grassroots activists - is necessary for the over-all development of the most
oppressed of India,Bearing in mind the responsibility to take
forward our struggle at this critical juncture in spite of the fact that most
political formations are reluctant to pursue any policy favourable to the Dalits,Recognising that the social consensus over
the Dalit cause - reluctantly agreed upon at the time of Independence - has by
and large broken down,Convinced that informed and democratic discourse
at all levels is essential to re-negotiate a new consensus over redeeming the
pledges of the founding fathers of the Republic to do justice to Dalits,Convinced also that the national psyche and
public discourse in the country accepts uncritically the rigid hierarchy and
discrimination caused by caste and thereby denies that caste is a major source
of prejudice and brutal violence,Emphasizing that Babasaheb's stress on struggle
through democratic and constitutional means is relevant today,Regretting that the post-Ambedkar Dalit intelligentsia
has failed both in carrying forward his emancipatory movement as well as making
a dent in the country's intellectual life,Recognizing the need for Dalits to make common
cause with other liberation and human rights movements in and outside the country,Conscious of the hurdles that caste-Hindu
society - and its tentacles in government, media, voluntary sector, etc., - is
likely to hurl at any serious movement that challenges the entrenched system
of discrimination and exclusion,Noting that women - especially Dalit women
- represent the most oppressed sections of our society, and that they face multiple
forms of discrimination, including caste-based, religious and patriarchal ideology
and practices,Welcoming the winds of change the world over
that are conducive to Inclusion, Equal Opportunity, Diversity, Democratisation
and Civil Society, and against discrimination, stereotype, stigma, exclusion
and caste society,Hoping that this country will no longer remain
an exception to the global norm of Progress, Equality, Justice, Peace and Social
Harmony, andWe hereby Solemnly proclaim that while we
rededicate ourselves to work in unison to achieve basic rights of Dalits, we
are convinced that unless the following issues are resolved no amount of activism
on our part and pro-active measures from the State can liberate the community
from the scourges of untouchability and exploitation.We therefore demand....1. Ensure that each Dalit family
will own enough cultivable land for socio-economic well-being. The government
should pursue all possible measures including the distribution of surplus land,
government revenue lands and temple lands within a specific timeframe. If the
need be, the government should purchase cultivate land and distribute it among
Dalits.2. Enact legislation and enforce
it stringently to enable Dalits have an equitable share in the appropriation
and use of the rural and urban common property resources. The law must be amended
to ensure that lengthy litigation with the ulterior motive of denying Dalits
of legal redressal, is not resorted to.3. Enact legislation and enforce
the right of Dalit agricultural labourers to living wages, to gender parity in
wages, to job security, to better working conditions and welfare measures, and
ensure punitive measures against offenders.4. Appoint Statutory Committees
at the national and state level to identify within specified time-frame all the
Depressed Class lands occupied by non-Dalits, to assess the quantum of compensation
to be paid by non-Dalits for their illegal utilization of lands, to identify
the original owners and their nearest kith and kin for restoring these lands
back to them, to expedite legal proceedings in courts specially appointed for
this purpose against the illegal occupants and to ensure punitive measures against
them.5. Ensure the restoration of
the alienated lands to the tribals, restore their rights over forest and forest-produce,
provide them with compensation and rehabilitation measures, extend resources
and capacity building measures for gainful utilization of their lands and forests
and make those Dalits displaced due to construction of dams/developmental projects
as shareholders of such enterprises.6. Democratise the capital so
as to ensure proportionate share for SCs and STs. Make budgetary allocation for
SCs and STs to enable them enter the market economy with adequate investment
resources, and develop their capacities and skills for such market enterprises.7. Enforce with stringent measures
the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976 and abolish forthwith child labour
to ensure freedom with dignity for all the Dalits, and accordingly make suitable
amendments in the appropriate legislations.8. Amend Art. 21 of the Constitution
of India: Fundamental Rights so as to include the following rights for all citizens,
but with special emphasis for SCs and STs, and on the basis of two criteria,
namely low economic income and without religious discrimination: the rights to
a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of women and men
equally, including food, safe drinking water, clothing, housing, public health
and medical care, social security and social services; the right to living wage
and the right to own 5 acres of cultivable land or to gainf! ul employment.9. Implement compulsory, free
and high quality education for all Dalits immediately, make allocation of funds
proportionate to the number and level of the illiterates, ensure compensation
to those families which forfeit their income from child-labour, increase the
number and amount of scholarships, and provide better infrastructural facilities
in SC and ST schools and offer market-oriented vocational and technical education.10. Make the reservation quota
applicable in all the public and private educational institutions from primary
to technical and professional levels. Every SC/ST child with low income-base
must be given quality free-education at State's expense. And every English medium
school must implement Diversity in Admissions.11. Recognize SC and ST women
as a distinct category among women, and accordingly make segregated data on Dalit
women available in census reports, action taken reports and progress reports,
evolve national and state level perspective plan for mainstreaming SC and ST
women in developmental programmes, market enterprises, financial allocation,
reservation facilities in education, employment and health facilities, and mandate
the National and State Commissions for SC and ST and for Women to study and report
specifically the status of SC and ST women in their annual reports.12. Implement effectively in
letter and spirit the SC and ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 & Rules1995,
especially with regard to atrocities against Dalit women, and accordingly prosecute
the dominant caste leaders and their minions who stoke the fire of caste clashes
and the police officials acting in connivance with them. In cases of atrocities
against SC/STs, a system of collective punishment has to be evolved as oppressors
enjoy community support and protection and escape the law.13. Ensure diversity or SC/STs'
due representation in all public institutions of India, whether universities
or academic or autonomous or registered bodies. Those institutions, which do
not abide by the principle of Affirmative Action, must lose recognition and state
funding. All private industry/ corporate houses must accept and implement Diversity
in workforce immediately.14. Ensure that in all state
and national budgets allocations are made as per the proportion of SC and ST
population and penal action taken against unutilisation or diversion of funds
meant for these sections.15. Every government and private
organization must implement Supplier Diversity from socially disadvantaged businesses
and Dealership Diversity in all goods and services.16. The State must assume sole
responsibility in protecting the SCs and STs. The State must identify those atrocity
prone areas and deploy forces. In addition, provide arms licences to the SCs & STs
as stipulated in the Atrocities Act for self-defence purposes, make the setting
up of Dalit self-defence groups from village onwards mandatory, and specially
train Dalit women to handle weapons in self-defence against the perpetrators
of crimes and atrocities.17.Eliminate the humiliating
practice of manual scavenging on an urgent footing through effective rehabilitation,
alternative and sustainable employment measures and developmental programmes,
and prosecute violators of the Employment of Manual Scavengers and Construction
of Dry Latrines (Prohibition) Act, 1993, especially the gross violators Railways,
Defence and Urban Local bodies.18. Make it statutory for Parliament
and State Assemblies to debate on the Annual Reports of the National and State
level Commissions for SC/ST and Safai Karamcharis within the following year,
and ensure that these annual reports and the action-taken reports of the government
are made public.19. Make reservation mandatory
in the private and corporate sector in the same proportion as in the public sector
and government institutions and develop the capacities and skills of Dalits to
help them cope up with the demands of these different sectors.20. Implement policy of reservation
to SCs and STs at all levels of judiciary and defence forces. And make transparent
appointment processes in Judiciary by doing away with the nomination system.21. Bring out a Truth Paper
in two years on the status of reservation during the past 25 years and place
it before Parliament and State Assemblies for debate, and on a war footing fill
immediately all the backlog posts meant for Dalits and that, too, only with Dalit
candidates.India Together
