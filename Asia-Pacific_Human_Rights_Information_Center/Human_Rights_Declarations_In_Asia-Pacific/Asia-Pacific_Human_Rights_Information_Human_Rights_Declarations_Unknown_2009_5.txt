Youth Declaration at the 5th APCRSHR
2009
Beijing, China, 17 October 2009We, the youth1participants of the 5th Asia Pacific Conference on Reproductive
and Sexual Health and Rights, held in Beijing, China on 17-20 October 2009, call
upon policy makers and decision makers from government, donors, private sectors,
as well as civil society to actively address SRHR of young people as a global
goal with specific time bound indicators.2We believe that the meaningful participation of young people plays a vital
role in improving their reproductive and sexual health and rights. Embracing
the fact that our communities are a reflection of the contributions made by each
of its members, including young people, we are committed to finding innovative
and effective strategies to meet the challenges that all young people are facing
in fulfilling our sexual and reproductive health and rights.We call upon policy-makers, decision makers, governments, donors, private
sector, civil society and all young people to make every effort to work hand-in-hand
in realizing achieving the goals of ICPD and MDGs' towards creating an enabling
environment, so that all young people are empowered to enjoy their sexuality
and protect themselves from harm.ICPD PoA (International Conference on Population and Development Plan of
Action) and MDGs (Millenium Development Goals) continue to play a key role in
Asia and the Pacific regional sexual and reproductive health and rights movements.
Under the above mentioned frameworks, consistent actions of national governments,
courageous political commitments, and positive policy changes for population,
health, and the environment have contributed significantly to the comprehensive
development of young people and adolescents in Asia and the Pacific region. However,
we believe that it is necessary to think beyond Cairo and acknowledge the limitations
of the ICPD Plan of Action, by pushing for a more inclusive and progressive agenda.The efforts made to provide integrated reproductive health services and education
that are comprehensive, sexpositive, gender-sensitive, youth-friendly, youth-driven,
which recognize the evolving capacities of young people are an invaluable investment
in the present and future of the region.Denying young people accessible sexual and reproductive health services and
education is a violation of young people's human rights and their right to development,
as affirmed by the ICPD and the Beijing Platform for Action.A significant number of young people in Asia and the Pacific do not have enough
knowledge about sexual and reproductive health and rights. This leaves them potentially
vulnerable to coercion, stigma and discrimination; abuse, violence and exploitation;
unintended pregnancies, unsafe abortion and sexually transmitted infections,
including HIV.Significantly, poverty and regional disparity in social and economic development
is the largest barrier in realizing the sexual and reproductive health and rights
of young people.To fulfill sexual and reproductive health and rights, as they are an inalienable
aspect of young people's right to health.To recognize that gender affects young people's lives and experiences. Young
people, especially young girls are deeply affected by harmful gender stereotypes
and gender inequality. Therefore, actions should be taken towards addressing
issues due to gender disparities such as child marriage, forced marriage, early
and forced pregnancy.To provide mechanism for easier access to funding and support for youth-led
and youth focused initiatives and establish strong and sustainable partnerships
between States, decisions makers, international agencies, donors, and NGO's,
government, civil societies, and young people.To ensure the involvement of young people at all programmatic, policy and
decision-making and budget planning and distribution at the national, regional
and international level.To invest in young people as a priority in population and development strategies
with programming specifically directed at increasing access to information, education,
counseling and skills that enable young people to make decisions about their
own wellbeing.Consequently, States should ensure that the different sectors of society are
fully informed, sensitized on youth issues and empowered to act in the best interests
of young people.To develop and enforce non-discriminatory sexual and reproductive health related
laws and policies at local, national, regional and international levels particularly
those concerning young people. This includes eliminating legal and policy barriers,
which restrict young people's access to essential services, such as parental
and spousal consent, age of consent and issues of confidentiality. Furthermore,
to assess the credibility of programmes, ensure transparency, and close monitoring
that is driven towards positive progressive results.To guarantee universal access to comprehensive sexuality education for all
young people, and ensure that all existing SRH services are youth-friendly, non-judgmental,
recognize and respect diversity and are accessible to all young people, including
underserved groups.Commit our individual capacities towards improving the health and well-being
of our societies.Commit to sharing accountability towards protecting the health and rights
of all individuals.Commit to enhance understanding across geographical regions, cultural and
religious diversities with a vision to achieve inclusive social development with
sustainability.Commit to continue promoting sexual and reproductive health and rights as
a primary component of equal opportunity and human development. We would like
to emphasize that many of the mentioned demands have been made at various instances
in the last 15 years. This document has to be seen in continuity with those that
have come before.We Commit. We Recommend. We Deserve.
