Manila Declaration for a 21st Century Independent Judiciary
2005
Principles: We re-affirm the core judicial
independence and accountability principles enshrined in the universal declaration
of human rights, the United
Nations Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary, the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Beijing
Declaration on Independence of the Judiciary, and recommit ourselves
to their speedy and effective implementation.Demands on the Judiciary: The demands on
the judiciary have grown exponentially in recent years. Country, regional and
global economic, political and technological trends also demand a 21st century
civilization grounded on the rule of law and access to justice for all citizens.
We recognize the need for judiciaries in the Asia-Pacific Region to work together
more closely to meet these common challenges. We also recognize that integrating
technology into the judicial systems can facilitate knowledge sharing and learning,
management of dockets, prompt disposition of cases, and better access to courts
by all citizens.Priority: Towards this end, the Chief Justices
and participants of this Conference were in unanimous agreement to establish
a judicial knowledge and technique sharing network (APJR Network) for all of
the Supreme Courts and the judicial community in the Asia-Pacific Region. Unlike
any other time in our region's history, almost every country is now embarking
in judicial reform. There is much to learn from one another about what to do
- and not do - on judicial reform. This necessarily calls for a forum or network
for knowledge sharing of judicial reform successes and failures.Objective: The main objective of the APJR
Network is to share knowledge, including lessons learned, problems faced, best
practices and potential model reform experiences from the region as well as globally.Next steps: The Philippine Supreme Court
believes in this important mission and is willing to serve as the Regional Secretariat
of the APJR Network. The court, under the leadership of Chief Justice Davide,
Jr., is very pleased to have served as the host for this Conference, which is
the first collaborative step in establishing the APJR Network. Next steps will
be undertaken by the Chief Justices of other Asia-Pacific countries who have
also committed to this mission and to hosting two working group reform roundtables
over the next year. These roundtables will identify areas of high priority collaboration
among Asia-Pacific Chief Justices, judges and judicial academies, with a view
to examining country experiences that have potential for replication or adaptation
in other countries within the region.Action: We all know that our ability to access,
share, and profit from specific judicial reform experiences in different countries
will be vital to our individual and collective success.For All: These workshops, annual conferences,
on-going APJR Electronic Dialogue, and the united support of the donor community,
will enable us to proceed with a 21st Century Judicial Reform Agenda in a concrete,
prioritized, and collaborative manner. We can strive for no less for all of our
citizens as well as for future generations.http://www.apjrf.com/declaration.html
