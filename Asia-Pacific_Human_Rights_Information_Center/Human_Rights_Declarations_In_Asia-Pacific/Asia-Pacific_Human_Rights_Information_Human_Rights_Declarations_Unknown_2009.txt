The Ambedkar Principles
2009
Principles and Guidelines to Address Caste Discrimination
in the Private SectorThe principles and guidelines are developed to address caste discrimination, which remains one of the most serious human rights issues in the world today.They acknowledge the multiple forms of discrimination against Dalits in the private sector and include recommendations on how to eliminate such practices through an active non-discrimination policy and affirmative action, in line with international human rights standards.They will enable national and multinational companies, as well as foreign investors, to contribute to eliminating
caste discrimination in the labour market in South Asia where it continues to
be a massive human rights issue.Companies supporting the Ambedkar
Principles are asked to work progressively towards their implementation and to
regularly, preferably annually, report on their progress as part of their diversity
or corporate social responsibility reporting, and also to consider engaging in
some form of external audit.The principles are built upon
the urgent need in any society for positive or affirmative action for severely
and structurally disadvantaged groups.Employment and rights
at work principles and guidelines to address caste discriminationImplementing the 'Employment and rights at work principles
and guidelines to address caste discrimination' implies that a company will be
building on existing national anti-discrimination laws, policies and acts in
the spirit of internationally recognised human and employment rights, while putting
into practice the general commitments found in international standards, as referred
to in the background section below. Companies adopting the Ambedkar Principles
will:Include in any statement
of employment policy a reference to the unacceptability of caste discrimination
and a commitment to seeking to eliminate it.Develop and implement a plan of affirmative action
for Dalits, paying special attention to Dalit women. Such a plan should
include training on combating caste discrimination for all employees, as well
as a special effort to recruit and train people with a Dalit background, especially
if Dalits are under-represented as employees in relation to their proportion
of the local population.Ensure that the company and its suppliers comply
with all national legislation, particularly in relation to bonded labour,
manual scavenging and child labour; pay specific attention to the role that caste
relations might play in legitimising or covering up such forms of labour, and
actively contribute to the implementation of existing anti-caste laws.Use fair recruitment, selection and career development
processes, with clear objective criteria, and ensure that these processes
are open to scrutiny from Dalits themselves as well as other civil society groups.Take full responsibility for their workforce, both
direct and subcontracted, including in the supply chain, by seeking
to detect and remedy any form of caste discrimination in employment conditions,
wages, benefits or job security.Evolve comprehensive training opportunities for employees
and potential recruits from Dalit communities (preferably integrated
with other staff where possible), including language support for English deficient
candidates, with the aim of enabling Dalit workers to fulfil their potential
and where-ever relevant set targets for the number of Dalit employees.Designate a senior level manager to implement the
policy who will aim to maximise the benefits of a diverse workforce
and ensure that the policy, its monitoring and the related practices are carried
through.Develop effective monitoring and verification mechanisms
of progress at the level of the individual company, and also co-operate
in monitoring at the levels of sector and the state, involving Dalit representatives
including women in these mechanisms.Publish a report annually on progress in implementing
the Ambedkar Principles, preferably in relation to an appropriate section
of the Annual Report, and be open to answer questions on policies and practices
regarding this issue by organizations and the general public.Put in place a protective system for whistleblowers in
order to make sure that people exposing cases of discrimination or non-functioning
policies against discrimination do not become victims of defending the human
rights of Dalits and other discriminated groups.Appoint a board member
with responsibility for oversight of this policy area.Make use of the Dalit Discrimination Check for
assessment of caste-based discrimination in order to identify prevent and remedy
discrimination and exploitation of Dalits in the workplace. Adapted to the Indian
context, Indian companies and suppliers can use the checklist at https://hrca.humanrightsbusiness.org/.Community-related principles
and guidelines to address caste discriminationCompanies who support the 'Community-related
principles and guidelines to address caste discrimination', outlined below, will
encourage and promote ownership of land and capital by Dalits, and broaden opportunities
for skill development in the context of their social and economic rights. These
principles should be a vital element in any social and/or environmental audit
prior to investments, supply-chain or other trade relations. 'Socially excluded
communities' refers primarily to Dalits but in particular contexts may include
tribal peoples, women and religious minorities.Companies in support
of the Ambedkar Principles, including the 'Community-related principles and guidelines
to address caste discrimination', will:Require that all corporate
support to community development programmes and other charitable activities in
caste-affected countries or areas include the participation of Dalits in both
planning and implementation, and that they receive an equal share in any benefits.Where land is leased and/or
purchased, ensure it has been done with the free and informed consent of those
using it and has been properly compensated and not been misappropriated, or otherwise
removed, from socially excluded communities.Actively seek to place a proportion
of supply and/or service contracts with local enterprises from socially excluded
communities.Avoid exploitation of local
resources to the detriment of local communities and urge others, including companies
and local authorities, to do likewise.Aim to ensure nothing is done
that may drive local communities towards ecologically insensitive activities
or the desperation of violent protest, while undertaking free and informed local
consultation to guarantee this.Encourage and enable a degree
of ownership of the investing and/or trading company or institution by socially
excluded communities, including Dalits.If the company is a bank or
financial institution, ensure that lending to priority sectors (in India a legal
requirement) seeks to assist Dalit community groups and Dalit entrepreneurs to
the maximum extent possible.Support educational projects
for socially excluded communities at all levels, primary, secondary and tertiary,
as well as in the form of training for posts at executive or management level.Promote and support the teaching
of English to Dalit communities, and encourage state and government authorities
to do the same, as the use of English greatly increases employment potential
