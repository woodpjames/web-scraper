Coverage of HRDC's FOIA suit against ICE over litigation records
2018
By Agueda Pacheco-Flores The Human Rights Defense Center  (HRDC), formerly known as Prison Legal News, has sued Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in federal court in Seattle, claiming the agency violated the law by failing to turn over records involving court settlements. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), ICE’s parent agency, is also named in the complaint that alleges a violation of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). HRDC Executive Director Paul Wright wrote in an email that the information the group is seeking could tell them if U.S. citizens have ever successfully sued ICE for wrongfully deporting them and if the agency is held accountable for detainees who have died in custody, among other possible legal violations. The complaint says ICE considered the request too broad and asked HRDC to narrow and clarify it. When the nonprofit declined, ICE did not process the FOIA request, determining it to be “vague, overbroad, and unduly burdensome.” Deb Golden, an attorney for HRDC, said the information would help the nonprofit understand why records show the government has used more than $51 million in taxpayer money to defend DHS and ICE in court. That number comes from the U.S. Treasury Judgment Fund, which keep tracks of “court judgments and Justice Department compromise settlements of actual or imminent lawsuits against the government.” Golden said while the online judgment fund only shows the monetary amount, it does not give any context and it may not be showing the total amount spent on defending ICE. “I have enough experience to know there are omissions in government records,” she said. “That’s the minimum amount, there could be more.” This isn’t the first time the group has sued ICE. A spokeswoman for ICE said the agency does not comment on pending litigation. HRDC is represented by Seattle attorney Eric Stahl.
