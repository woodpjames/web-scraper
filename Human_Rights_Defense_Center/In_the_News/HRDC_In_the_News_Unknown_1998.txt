PLN mentioned in news brief re suit filed over UT DOC censorship - Salt Lake Tribune 1998Salt Lake Tribune (Utah)April 24, 1998, FridayFor the RecordINMATE SUES OVER MAILUtah State Prison inmate Walter J. Thomas has sued Pete Haun, executive director of the Department of Corrections, over a prison mail policy. Thomas alleges he is not getting his subscription copies of Prison Legal News, published in Seattle, because the prison does not allow inmates to get bulk-rate mail. The federal suit, filed Thursday, alleges the ban violates Thomas' First Amendment and due-process rights. Corrections spokesman Jack Ford said the prison does accept items mailed bulk rate if an inmate has a paid subscription. He did not immediately know why two issues sent to Thomas were apparently rejected. Thomas demands damages of $1 for each day he has been restricted by the policy, $5 for each rejected magazine and $500 for the alleged violation of his rights.
