NCCD honors the media’s success and vital role in illuminating the people and programs that uncover the root causes of crime and those that promise to protect our most precious resource—our youth—against involvement in crime.A critical link in successful policies related to youth and justice is the education of the public. The media is uniquely positioned to be this link, and we gratefully acknowledge their efforts to fulfill that responsibility. Each year the PASS Awards honor media professionals in the fields of print, literature, broadcast media, television, and film in recognition of thoughtful and factual coverage of the issues. Special consideration is given to those stories that highlight solutions to criminal and juvenile justice and child welfare problems.NCCD is the nation's oldest private organization working to attain responsive and effective criminal justice, juvenile justice, and child welfare systems. For over 100 years, NCCD has been committed to promoting criminal justice strategies that are fair, humane, cost-effective, and uncompromising in public safety. The issues that have defined NCCD since its inception are the need for a separate and humane justice system for children, alternatives to incarceration, and the fundamental connection between social justice and public safety.For more information on NCCD, please visit our website at www.nccd-crc.orgFILMIce T Presents “25 to Life” Deloss Pickett, Michael Dallum“At the Death House Door” Steve James, Peter GilbertLITERATUREAmerican Furies: Crime, Punishment, and Vengeance in the Age of Mass Imprisonment by Sasha AbramskyChasing Justice by Kerry Max Cook, Sandra Kaye Pressey, Kerry Justice Cook, Peter HubbardFrom the Bottom of the Heap: The Autobiography of Black Panther Robert Hillary King by Robert Hillary King and Andrea GibbonsI’ll Fly Away: Further Testimonies from the Women of York Prison by Walley LambLetters From the Dhamma Brothers by Jenny Phillips, Pariyatti Press, Ron CavanaughMaximum Security: The True Meaning of Freedom by Alan GompersPrison Profiteers: Who Makes Money from Mass Incarceration by Paul Wright, Tara Herivel and Dianne WachtelStanley Tookie Williams Street Peace Series by Stanley Tookie Williams and Barbara BecnelThe Real Cost of Prisons Comix by Lois Ahrens, Kevin Pyle, Sabrina Jones, Susan Willmarth, Ellen Miller-Mack and Craig GilmoreMAGAZINESan Jose Mercury News“A Painful Choice for Moms in Prison” Edwin Garcia, Karen Borchers, Miller-McCune“Is This the Future of the War on Drugs?” by Vince Beiser,John MecklinNEWSPAPEREast Valley Tribune “Reasonable Doubt” by Ryan Gabrielson, Paul Giblin, Patti EplerLong Beach Press-Telegram “Lots of Answers, but No Easy Fixes” byWendy Thomas Russell andTracy ManzerSeattle Weekly “Neverminded” by Laura Onstot and Mike SeelyThe Daily Review “Educate to Break Cradle-to-Prison Pipeline” by Tammerlin DrummondThe Sacramento Bee “Unprotected” Marjie Lundstrom, Sam Stanton, Autumn Cruz, Mitchell BrooksThe Village Voice “Teen Murders at Rikers Jail” by Graham Rayman, Tony OrtegaThe Washington Post “Rehabilitating Juvenile Offenders” by Robert Pierre, Carol Morello Westword“Stand and Deliver” byAdam Cayton-Holland, Patricia Calhoun, Anthony CameraRADIOAmerican Radioworks -“Gangster Confidential" Michael Montgomery and Catherine WinterKALW Radio “Prisons in Crisis: A State of Emergency in California” JoAnn Mar, Alyne EllisKQED/Forum “Prisoner Health” by Scott Shafer, Nick Vidinsky andDan ZollTELEVISION/ VIDEOHBO - “The Wire, Season 5” by David Simon, Nina Kostroff Noble, Ed Burns, Joe Chappelle.Karen L.ThorsonSoCal Connected/KCET -“Inside Locke High” Angela Shelley andAlexandria Gales, Brett Wood, Michael Bloecher,Bret MarcusNBC/Wolf Films “Law and Order: SVU - Confession” Dick Wolf, Neal Baer, Ted Kotcheff, Peter Jankowski, Arthur Forney, Judith McCrearyWEBAlterNet -“Meet Gus Puryear” by Silja J.A.
