PLN comments on escape of prisoners from private prison transport vehicle
2016
By: Julie MontanaroApril 5, 2016 We have reached out to U.S. Corrections to try to find out how the men managed to escape, but have not yet received a response to our list of questions. According to its web site, the private company handles transport of prisoners in all 50 states. The website also claims using the transport service can save law enforcement agencies 45 to 80%. Earlier today we spoke with Alex Friedmann who studies privatization in corrections. He says private transport companies can save agencies money, but there can also be a downside. "The main drawback is the lack of accountability," Friedmann said. "You want to have more direct control and supervision over law enforcement functions and when you contract that out - typically to the lowest bidder - then sometimes you get what you pay for." Friedmann says there is limited data on incidents and accidents. He says the only law regulating these private transport services was passed in 2000 after an 11 year old girl was killed by an escapee. U.S. Corrections' web site says it is fully compliant with that law.
