    Français (French) The AEDH, together with its German member the International League for Human Rights, condemns the readmission policy of refugees from Kosovo pursued by the German government and the governments of the Länder. This policy aims to expel thousands of people, the majority children, who have been living for several years in Germany, to Kosovo. This happens at a time, when several European states have been using the Roma as scapegoats for their policies. Already in 2009, it has been revealed that the German federal government had the intention of expelling people that supposedly belong to the Kosovan Roma minority and who do not have a long term residence permit. These expulsions concern mainly children and adolescents, younger than 18 years old, the majority of which were born on German territory. In April 2010, the German federal government signed a readmission agreement with the Kosovan government, in which Pristina commits to receive these people from Germany without residence permits, and who fled the Serbian oppression and the war in Kosovo in the 1990s.
