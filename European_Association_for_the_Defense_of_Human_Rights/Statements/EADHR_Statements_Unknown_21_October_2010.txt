21 October 2010
AEDH and Otwarta Rzeczpospolita are concerned about the infringement of equality and human rights which recently occurred in Poland and the indulgent reaction of the Polish authorities on this subject. In a recent statement the Polish Minister for Equal Treatment declared that it was justifiable for Catholic schools to fire homosexual professors based solely on their sexual orientation, therefore supporting discriminatory practices based on sexual orientation.
