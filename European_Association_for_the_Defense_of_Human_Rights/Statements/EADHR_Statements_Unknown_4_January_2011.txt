    Français (French) The AEDH can only welcome the responsibility that the European Parliament took in voting against the proposal on a “single permit” by a 350 to 306 vote during the plenary session this Tuesday December 14th, 2010. The Commission’s proposed directive, using the implementation of a single process for the application of both work and residency permit as an excuse, leaded in fact to exclusion and discriminations between workers, based on their origin, their qualifications, and the nature of their job, thus violating the Charter of Fundamental Rights which proclaims equality for all people living on the EU territory.
