    Français (French) On 3 March, Tunisia and the European Union signed a ‘mobility partnership’. Over the last two years, the signatory organizations have repeatedly expressed their concerns about this partnership. We hereby reiterate them and condemn the lack of transparency in the negotiation process which did not involve civil society actors, many of whom have been active on issues directly relevant to the agreement. The implementation of such agreement is particularly worrying in the current Tunisian transitional context where key institutions and legislative instruments needed to guarantee the respect of the rights of migrants, refugees and asylum seekers are still lacking.
