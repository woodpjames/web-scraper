    Français (French) On 5th December, a ‘Mobility Partnership’ will be signed by representatives of the European Union (EU), its member states and Tunisia. Within this context, AEDH, together with numerous organisations, deplores that civil society has not been involved in the negotiating process. These organisations are worried not only about the situation of migrants and refugees in Tunisia which remains very difficult but also about the fact that this ‘Mobility Partnership’ do not provide Tunisian citizens with real opportunities to enter and live in the European Union. Thus, signatories call on the EU and Tunisia to translate into concrete actions their commitments to promoting and protecting human rights, and to facilitate freedom of movement for all Tunisian citizens. “No so-called ‘mobility’ partnership should be signed until the rights of migrants and refugees are fully guaranteed”.
