The Agreement between the European Community and Pakistan on readmission raises significant questions concerning the respect of human rights â€“ Press release, 26 April 2010
26 April 2010
The AEDH challenges the manner in which a readmission agreement between the European Union and Pakistan would be implemented. The Agreement concerns Pakistani nationals and individuals who have transited through Pakistan, particularly Afghan nationals, who would be irregular on the territory of the European Union. Pakistan is not a signatory of the Geneva Convention on Refugees of 1951 nor of the Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons of 1954. This Agreement raises a number of questions about the terms and conditions of readmission, the processing of personal data collected in order to justify and implement readmission and the process by which this agreement would be enforced by the European Union and the concerned States. In a detailed analysis covering point-by-point the issues of this Agreement, the AEDH wants to show how its content and application procedures are contrary to fundamental rights. This analysis is available in French on the AEDH website and soon in English. The press release in available in English, French and Italian.
