    Français (French) 27 february 2017 – To members of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs You are about to vote on the Proposal for a Regulation of Procedure of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing an Entry/Exit System (EES) to register entry and exit data and refusal of entry data of third country nationals crossing the external borders of the Member States of the European Union and determining the conditions for access to the EES for law enforcement purposes and amending Regulation (EC) No 767/2008 and Regulation (EU) No 1077/201. This text contains many provisions which violate the fundamental rights to privacy and data protection protected by Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. Concerns raised by the 2013 draft are aggravated by the new repressive aim, the creation of a massive database of biometric data, unsatisfactory rules on: the security and integrity of the data stored, interconnections, transfers to third countries, deficient rules for the right of access, and the right to remedy and to appeal, and disproportionate length of data retention. Given the imminence of your vote you will find below a short summary of the concerns AEDH gas regarding several provisions in this text: In conclusion, AEDH asks you not to choose solutions that come with unjustified restrictions to the fundamental right of privacy and data protection on the pretext that these measures seem easy and at a low price. Moreover, the way in which this system is organised and the way of conservation risk affecting seriously the freedom of movement for some people for an uncontrolled period, with no other justification than its technical functioning.
