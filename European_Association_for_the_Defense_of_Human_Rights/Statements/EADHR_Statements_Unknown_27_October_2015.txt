Stressing that the current “refugee and migrant crisis” will  not cease in the short term and that longer term policies and a holistic approach combining different policies are needed. CSE calls  for the establishment of a structured dialogue between decision-makers and civil society organisations on the issue of migration.  This should be  at both national and EU level in order to develop a long term response where actors from different fields and sectors play their appropriate role.
