The AEDH asks members of the European Parliament not to approve the readmission agreement with Pakistan – Press release, 12 July 2010
14 July 2010
The AEDH is deeply concerned about the content and practical enforcement of the readmission agreement signed between the European Union and Pakistan and calls on MEPs to reject it. It raises significant concerns about the respect of human rights and in particular those of  refugees. The AEDH believes that readmission agreements endanger human rights. Readmission counters  the right to leave one’s country, a right guaranteed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In the case of Pakistan, readmission means forcing someone to return to a country where fundamental rights are not respected and which has not ratified the Geneva Convention on Refugees of 1951.
