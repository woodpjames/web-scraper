The AEDH says “No!” to joint return flights – Press release, November, 9th 2009
9 November 2009
The EU heads of state and government that met within the European Council on 29-30 October 2009 came to an agreement regarding the "examination of the possibility of regular chartering financed by FRONTEX [the European agency in charge of managing the EU’s external borders] of joint return flights." Accordingly, they have invited the Commission to present proposals to this end in early 2010. The AEDH has always expressed its opposition to organising "charter flights" to return migrants to their country of origin or even a country of transit. The press release is available in English and French.
