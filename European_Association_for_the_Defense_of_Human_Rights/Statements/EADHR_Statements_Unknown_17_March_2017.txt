Sign-Up Letter calling for Full Lobby Transparency Now !
17 March 2017
Initiated by ALTER-EU, Civil Society Europe and Transparency International EU, more than 100 civil society organisations have decided to co-sign the letter addressed to Vice President Sylvie Guillaume MEP and Danuta Hübner MEP, chair of the Constitutional Affairs committee who will represent the European Parliament in negotiations for a reformed lobby transparency register. NGO’s frequently witness how big business enjoys excessive influence over EU policy-making, leading to decisions which put profits ahead of people and the planet, and reduce citizens trust in a united Europe. ALTER EU, Civil Society Europe and Transparency International EU believe that lobby transparency is an important tool in the fight for public-interest decision-making at the European level. The European Commission has recently launched a proposal for a reformed lobby transparency register, and the European Parliament and Council are now invited to negotiate an inter-institutional agreement to make this reality. We believe that the European Parliament must seize the opportunity presented by this inter-institutional agreement process to demand a far more effective lobby register. Such a register should be the first, essential step in a much longer process to make EU policy-making far more transparent, tackle excessive corporate influence, and bring the EU institutions closer to citizens. We want to see a comprehensive lobby transparency register which covers both direct and indirect lobbying, and that can tell us accurately who is influencing EU decision-making, on which issues, on whose behalf, and with what budgets.
