The agreement between the EU and the United-States on the processing of financial messaging data must not be implemented – Press release, 11 February 2010
11 February 2010
AEDH protests against the enforcement of the temporary agreement between the EU and the USA on the processing of Financial Messaging Data from the European Union to the United States for the purpose of the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program. This agreement was approved by the Council on 30 November 2009, to avoid the co-decision procedure of the Lisbon Treaty (enforceable since 1 December 2009) and the observations made by the European Parliament. But it requires the latter’s assent. The parliamentary Committee on “Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs” had the courage to vote against this agreement. We ask the European Parliament to stand against it. The press release is available in English , German, French and Italian.
