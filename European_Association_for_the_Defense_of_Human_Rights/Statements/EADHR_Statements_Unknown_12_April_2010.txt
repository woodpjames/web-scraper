Personal data: a comic book to raise awareness among European young adults – Press release, 7 April 2010
12 April 2010
 Information and communication technologies (telephone, Internet, emails, blogs and social networks) make daily life and relationships with our relatives, friends or even strangers easier. Young people and young adults make a particularly intense use of them. However, unless we are careful, they can lead us to hand over excessive amounts of our personal data, facilitating surveillance of our private lives.  Protection of personal data is crucial for the respect for privacy.  The European Union has established a legislative and regulatory framework which aims at ensuring the protection of citizens’ personal data as one of their fundamental rights. What is the reality in practice and how can we protect ourselves on a daily basis? The press release is available in English, French and Italian. Download the comic book in English and French.
