Access to information and communication networks is a fundamental right – Press release, 27 November 2009
27 November 2009
AEDH wishes to point out that access to information and communication, and therefore the Internet, is a fundamental right guaranteed by the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Consequently, any move to restrict access to the Internet should be exceptional and must only be decided upon by judicial authorities within a framework that recognises the right of defense. AEDH is therefore deeply concerned about the withdrawal of “amendment 138” from the Telecoms Package.µ The press release is available in English , Spanish and French.
