    Français (French) The AEDH asks MEPs to disapprove the new EU-US agreement, concerning the transmission of data of passengers travelling to or from the US (PNR) to American authorities. It doesn’t offer enough safeguards for data protection and privacy. On the 26th of March 2012 the Civil Liberties Committee rejected the report of Ms. Sophia In’t Veld on the EU-US agreement on the use and transfer of PNR. Yet, this report highlighted legal uncertainties and obvious concerns set out in this agreement.  This vote in the LIBE Committee seems to contradict previous parliamentary resolutions and particularly those of 5th May and 11th November 2010 conditioning such approval.
