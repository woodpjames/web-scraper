A reinforced Frontex agency, EU turns a deaf ear to NGO’s warnings

    Français (French) 22 September 2016 – More powerful           than ever and enjoying complete impunity, the EU border           management agency has a new name with a reinforced mandate.           The European Union has indeed opted for an increase in the           means allocated to deportation, control and external           cooperation activities, with no regard for the rights of           migrants and refugees. By reshaping         Frontex’s mandate – now the “European Border and Coast Guard         Agency” – to reinforce the agency’s capacities, the European         Union (EU) disrespects fundamental human rights and still does         not address the challenges it faces, which the European         migratory context has exposed in the past two years. While the number of         deaths and disappearances keeps growing at European borders –         among whom many people in need of international protection(1),         Frontex will now be able to deploy its forces more rapidly at         the EU’s external borders to block those intending to cross. This           will only result in making migrants’ journeys more dangerous. Moreover, the agency         can disembark intercepted people in a “port of safety”,         including in non-EU countries; this provision contradicts the         rulings of the European Court for Human Rights and the         non-refoulement principle. Frontex also has         greater means allocated to external cooperation (operations and         information exchange) with a growing number of countries, some         of which notoriously do not respect human rights(2).  Yet the         European Parliament has no oversight on Frontex’s external         cooperation. Not only are the         means of the agency reinforced, but the new mandate also           maintains a system where responsibilities between Member           States and Frontex are diluted, enabling the latter to act in           total impunity. For instance, when it was accused of         having made excessive and near-systematic use of force         (including fire arms) when deployed in the Aegean Sea in late         August 2016, Frontex denied responsibility and shifted the blame         to the Greek authorities(3). However, following an investigation         conducted at national level, the Greek coast-guards ended up not         being sanctioned. Furthermore, the         complaint mechanism established in the new mandate, and which         the EU Ombudsman has called for since 2012, remains insufficient         to make the agency and/or its staff accountable before an         independent court. Victims of human rights violations during the         agency’s operations still cannot access redress mechanisms. Yet, the agency           continues to put a number of rights at risk(4): first and         foremost, the right to leave any country including one’s own;         but also the right to seek asylum and the principle of         non-refoulement, the right to personal data protection and the         right to an effective remedy. Although the         approval of the new mandate by the Council of the EU comes as no         surprise, the green light given by the European Parliament         leaves a bitter taste. The Parliamentary assembly has thereby         legitimised and set in stone the absence of democratic control         over a number of Frontex operations, in particular those         conducted outside of the EU. Frontex is           emblematic and is the armed wing of EU policies aimed to fence           off European borders. Consequently, member organisations of           the Frontexit campaign call for its suppression and for the EU           to finally opt for policies that respect fundamental rights,           in particular the “right to leave any country including one’s           own”.
