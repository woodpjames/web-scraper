    Français (French) As the European Union and Tunisia prepare to begin discussions on a “mobility agreement” on 6 December 2012 in Tunis, the Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights network (EMHRN), the International federation for Human Rights (FIDH), the Tunisian forum for economic and social Rights (FTDES), the European association for the defense of Human Rights (AEDH), the organization Migreurop and the Centre of Tunis for migration and asylum (CeTuMA) call upon the EU and the government of Tunisia to ensure that any agreement concluded in the context of the partnership on migrations is based on the unconditional guarantee of the rights of migrants, refugees and asylum seekers. Our organisations are concerned about the stated desire to reach agreement on migrations as quickly as possible even though the rights of migrants, refugees and asylum seekers in Tunisia are currently not protected because the country has no system for guaranteeing the right to asylum, the right to non-refoulement or the rights of foreign nationals in general.
