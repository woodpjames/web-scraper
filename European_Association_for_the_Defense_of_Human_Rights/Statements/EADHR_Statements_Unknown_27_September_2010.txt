Discrimination against cross-border workers: An unacceptable and intolerable “cure” for the crisis – Press release, September 24th 2010
27 September 2010
The AEDH, along with the Luxembourg League for Human Rights (ALOS-LDH) and the French League for Human Rights (LDH), supports the initiatives undertaken by trade unions and associations to denounce the legislative changes introducing a de facto distinction between resident and cross-border workers in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. Luxembourg has introduced new laws and regulations that both establish criteria limiting payment of family allowances and change how income taxes are calculated. The press release is available in English, French, German and Italian.
