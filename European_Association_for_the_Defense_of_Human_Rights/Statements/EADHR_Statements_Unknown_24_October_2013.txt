EU migration and asylum policy : letter to the European Council
24 October 2013
Ahead of the European Council summit, AEDH, together with several organisations based in the north and the south of the Mediterranean, calls on the heads of State and government to abandon security-oriented and repressive asylum and immigration policy. AEDH hopes that the European Summit on 24 and 25 October offers the European Union the opportunity to lay the ground for a new European asylum and immigration policy.
