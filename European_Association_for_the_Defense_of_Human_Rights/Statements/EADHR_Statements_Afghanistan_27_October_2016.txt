    Français (French) More than 26 civil society organisations including AEDH, have called on the European Parliament to address the Joint Way Forward agreement between the EU and Afghanistan. The agreement ignores the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan and the major risks of rights violations such as the principle of non-refoulement, protection against collective expulsions and the right to asylum. The agreement was negotiated covertly, without any consultation of the European Parliament, contrarily to the rules laid down in the EU treaties for concluding readmission agreements.
