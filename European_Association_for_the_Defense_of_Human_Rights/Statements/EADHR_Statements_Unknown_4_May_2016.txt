    Français (French) Brussels, 4 May 2016   For the second time in less than a year, the European Commission has presented a “plan” bringing forward reform propositions to solve the European Asylum and Migration crisis.  In a note published today, AEDH observes that the European Commission is offering to organise the regression of the rights of asylum seekers and refugees, in a bid to seek the support of Member States and stem the flow of people entering the European territory with the hope of finding protection there.  How far will the European Union go in denying its fundamental values and its history?  AEDH and its member organisations, present in most European countries, call on civil society and, first and foremost, European and national members of parliament to stop this downward spiral, which is not only unjust but also dangerous.  No lasting solution or project for the future can be based on the withdrawal of the rights of the people. This goes for the European Union and its citizens as well as the refugees.
