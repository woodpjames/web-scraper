    Français (French) Eurosur, the proposal for regulation concerning a border monitoring system, was presented by the European Commission on December 12th 2011, and puts cross-border crime on the same level as illegal immigration. It overlooks search and rescue at sea, despite it featuring in the 2008 Communication. Eurosur is defined as a ‘system of systems’, providing for the strengthening of borders in order to reach an integrated management system in cooperation with the agency Frontex. This is made possible by the interconnecting and rationalisation of surveillance systems that exist within member states, the technical sharpening of monitoring tools on an EU scale (satellites and drones, for example), creating a shared EU maritime information space and cooperating with third party neighbouring countries. AEDH condemns regulation that threatens the fundamental rights of asylum seekers and immigrants, that does not make search and rescue operations at sea a priority, that places EU responsibilities on third party countries, and is a threat to guarantees of data protection and privacy.
