    Français (French) AEDH strongly condemns the forced rehousing of 2,000 Romanian Roma to an old highly toxic chemical plant. Roma in the Craica and Pirita quarters in Baia Mare, situated in the North-West of Romania, have had their housing threatened by demolition since April 2012, and were forcefully evicted in early June. The town authorities relocated them to an old CUPROM works (a Romanian company dealing in processing ferrous metals), where the old laboratory floors are still strewn with chemical waste.
