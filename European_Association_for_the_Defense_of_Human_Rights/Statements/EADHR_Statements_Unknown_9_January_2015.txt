    Français (French) Brussels,  9th January  2015 The criminal attack perpetrated against the French satirical paper Charlie Hebdo on 7 January 2015, leading to the deaths of 12 people, has shocked France, along with the entire European Union and beyond. AEDH is horrified by this odious act targeting people and the press. Freedom of the press and freedom of expression are the safeguards of democracy and keep democracy alive. There is no room for any form of threat or violence that attempts to curtail freedom of expression. All such acts must be condemned in the strongest possible terms. AEDH calls upon European citizens to show their unity and to fight all ideologies of violence, all forms of religious fanaticism and all attempts to exploit the attack by using it to justify Islamophobic and xenophobic sentiment, the rise of which can already be observed everywhere in Europe. Today, more than ever, we must join forces across borders to work against racist and xenophobic movements. AEDH asks political leaders to hold fast to the fundamental values of democracy and the State of law in all of the initiatives they deem necessary, to condemn strongly all forms of stigmatisation, and to refrain from further eroding the rights of citizens in the name of the war against terrorism.
