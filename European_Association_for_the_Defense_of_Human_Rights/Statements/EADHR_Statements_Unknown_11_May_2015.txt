    Français (French)   The expectations surrounding the European Council of April 23rd quickly turned into disillusions. Facing increasing shipwrecks to a scale never seen before, the members of the European Council once again preferred to put forward the security dimension of migrations across the Mediterranean instead of the saving of lives. By the side of numerous associations, AEDH is mobilised to face this perpetual inaction of the European leaders and calls the French President of the Republic as well as all the representatives to change their policies, whose guideline would be the respect of life and human dignity. See the call to the French President of the Republic (in French only). See the mobilisation call from AEDH (in French only).
