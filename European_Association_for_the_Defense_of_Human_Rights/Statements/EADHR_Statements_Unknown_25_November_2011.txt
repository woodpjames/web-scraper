    Français (French) One month before the beginning of the evaluation of the different national policies for Roma inclusion of the Member States of the Commission, AEDH denounces the passive stance of the European Commission and the Council confronted with the violent acts committed against the Roma in a certain number of European countries. During the plenary session of 16 November of the European Parliament in Strasbourg, the question of the Roma situation in the European Union (EU) was addressed. This is not the first time this issue has been debated, but once again, the Commission and the Council were unable to account for concrete measures set up in the Member States to bring an end to the violence against the Roma or even to identify what is needed in terms of national policies for Roma inclusion.
