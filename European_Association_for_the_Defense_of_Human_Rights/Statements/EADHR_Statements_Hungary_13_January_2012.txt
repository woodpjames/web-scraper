    Français (French) As it came into force on January 1st 2012, despite numerous criticisms it was subjected to, the new Hungarian Constitution (called Fundamental Law) and its attached cardinal laws seriously infringe democracy and rule of law in Hungary and are against fundamental values of the European Union as established in article 2 of the Treaty on the European Union. AEDH denounces the passivity of the European Commission which waited too long to react in spite of the request of the European Parliament to review the Constitution and the cardinal laws, and of the many alerts sent by the Hungarian and European civil society.
