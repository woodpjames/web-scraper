    Français (French) AEDH welcomes the European Union’s commitment to combating sexual abuse, sexual exploitation of children and child pornography. However, this must not be done at the expense of the basic right to access means of communication and information, including Internet access. Consequently, Article 21 of the proposal for a directive on combating sexual abuse, sexual exploitation of children and child pornography – on which an indicative vote will be held on 14 February 2011 by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs at the plenary sitting of the European Parliament in Strasbourg – must be amended. Its sole objective must be the removal of child pornographic content from Internet sites at the source, and it must not authorize Member States to block access to Internet content.
