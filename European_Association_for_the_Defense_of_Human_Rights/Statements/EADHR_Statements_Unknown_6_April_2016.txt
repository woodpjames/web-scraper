    Français (French) Brussels, 22 March 2016 -AEDH firmly condemns the attacks in Brussels. Prosecuting the attackers while defending democracy, the rule of law and human rights is the only possible answer to terrorist attacks. Attacks in the centre and in the airport of Brussels have killed over 30 people and more than hundred are injured.  It is with grief and compassion that AEDH is thinking of the victims, their families and loved ones.  Nothing justifies these horrible acts. Prosecuting the attackers while defending democracy, the rule of law and human rights is the only possible answer to terrorist attacks. Any illegal procedure, any breach to justice, and any generalisation made on a given community are incitements for the assassins, as they look for them avidly.  AEDH will not accept restrictions to equal freedoms and rights in the name of the fight against terrorism. AEDH will not accept that people are stigmatised for their suspected or actual origin.  Together, let’s defend an open society based on the values of solidarity, democracy and fundamental rights.
