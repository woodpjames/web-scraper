    Français (French) The European Parliament adopted, on 12 September 2011i, a resolution modifying the regulation of the Frontex agencyii. This reform introduces several clauses aiming at guaranteeing a greater respect of fundamental rights by the agency, something which can only be seen as very positive considering that many have requested it, in particular NGOs. However AEDH notices that, beyond this progress in principle, questions remain and even scepticism regarding the efficiency of the guarantees voted by the European Parliament. There is scepticism also regarding the future of this reform which still has to be approved by the Council in order to come into force. Besides the inscription in the regulation of the agency of the obligation to respect fundamental rights, the Parliament voted in favour of the creation of a fundamental rights officer and a consultative forum, both in charge of making sure that human rights are respected. A clause would also be introduced in this regulation for the suspension of any Frontex operation in case of human rights violations. Border guards would receive training in the fields of human rights, asylum, and maritime law. Download the press release.
