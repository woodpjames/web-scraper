    Français (French) AEDH would like to draw MEPs’ attention to the new EU-US agreement and the lack of guarantees concerning the protection of personal data and privacy, regarding passengers travelling to and from the United States, and the transmitting of their data to the American authorities (PNR). The agreement does not conform to protection criteria as defined by European legislation and Convention 108 of the Council of Europe. It relies on trust placed in the American authorities, and particularly in the DHS, on a subjective appreciation concerning the efficiency of its own protection of personal data system. It is not founded on shared rules, or on a system of effective judicial appeals. Download the press release in English and French.
