    Français (French) Brussels – 4 April 2016 The President of the Belgian League of Human Rights (LDH), Alexis Deswaef, was arrested by police on Saturday 2 April at Place de la Bourse, in Brussels. First of all, the European Association for the Defence of Human rights (AEDH) of which LDH is a member expresses its support for Alexis and his organisation. Then, AEDH protests against the unbearable excesses of the police who did not hesitate to conduct an arrest without reasonable grounds and in the absence of any wrongful act. It hence seems to be a preventive and ostensive measure that is politically oriented against those who defend human rights and freedom of expression – since it was followed by about fifty other arrests.  AEDH takes note of the difference of treatment by police authorities when it concerns identity groups doing the Nazi salute on Place de la Bourse and whose objective is to sabotage the spirit of liberty, solidarity and tribute to the victims of the terrorist attacks.  AEDH urges the Home Affairs Minister and the Mayor of Brussels to fully investigate police actions. The principles of democracy and freedom of expression should be reflected by an exemplary behavior of law enforcement authorities.   AEDH recalls that, in such a tragic context, protecting democratic, civil and social rights for everyone is the only way to ensure that racist exactions do not constitute an outlet for terrorist crimes.
