    Français (French) For the last few months, the AEDH has undertaken the consolidation of its relationship of reciprocal consultation with Members of the European Parliament from different political groups. The aim of this informal group of ‘Friends of the AEDH’ is to contribute to the development of a profound reflection on all the issues related to fundamental rights in the European Union. On Wednesday 12th of October, under these very recent auspices, a first public meeting was organised in the European Parliament in Brussels. Under the joint presidency of Marie-Christine Vergiat (GUE/NGL) and Pierre Barge (AEDH), the topic was “The Consequences and Repercussions of the Arab Revolutions on the Politics of the European Union”. With the support of the Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Network (EMHRN), several speakers from Maghreb (Tunisia) and Machrek (Egypt) were able to expose the situation prevailing in their countries and the aspirations of their fellow inhabitants.
