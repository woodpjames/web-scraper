    Français (French) How many tragic deaths in the Mediterranean Sea will it take before the European Union acknowledges its international commitments and receive migrants from the Maghreb who are now waiting at its doorstep? AEDH laments the death of hundreds of Somalian and Eritrean migrants, who perished when their vessel sank off the coast of the Italian island of Lampedusa last 6 April. While it recognises that the European Union could not have predicted the influx that would be generated by the uprisings in the Arab world, AEDH contends that Member States still have the responsibility of providing a proper reception to the migrants who have arrived in Europe these past weeks, and to propose solutions that would help reinstate tens of thousands of refugees who, in fleeing Libya, had no other choice but to go to Tunisia or Egypt.
