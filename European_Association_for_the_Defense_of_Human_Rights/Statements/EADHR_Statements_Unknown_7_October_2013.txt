Lampedusa :  When will the European Union recognise its responsibility ? – Press Release 7th October 2013
7 October 2013
In the aftermath of the disaster in Lampedusa, where hundreds of migrants lost their life, AEDH denounces the attitude of the European Union and its migration policy towards third country nationals that are trying to come to Europe. Thus, AEDH asks member states to show more solidarity and humanity towards these migrants and to take their share in the reception of asylum seekers.  It further calls upon elected officials to put the issue of migration and asylum at the heart of the next European elections and European citizens to engage themselves for a real change in the EU’s migration policy.
