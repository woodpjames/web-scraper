    Français (French) AEDH hereby pays tribute to a man who, in addition to being a great writer, showed the world his determination through the path of his life. Thanks to the courage, the perseverance, and the intellectual and moral rectitude of Václav Havel, we are able today to fight together for a Europe of solidarity, a Europe based on human rights principles. Refusing exile after the Soviet occupation of 1968, Havel signed the Charter 77 document in January 1977 along with 242 other intellectuals. Thousands more citizens followed his lead. Not only was Charter 77 based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, it addressed social matters as well. Download the press release.
