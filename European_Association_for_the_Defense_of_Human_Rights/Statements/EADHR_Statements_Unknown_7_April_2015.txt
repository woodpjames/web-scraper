    Français (French) 7 April 2015 – In a joint press release, more than 45 organisations from 8 different countries – including the European Association for the Defence of Human Rights (AEDH) – call on the members of the European Parliament to revise the draft directive on trade secrets that will be debated in the European Parliament Legal Affairs Committee in May. This draft directive, published by the European Commission in November 2013, aims at developing an operational definition of trade secrets to ensure that the know-how and therefore the competitiveness of European business and research organisations is properly protected. The signatories consider that this project is a threat to fundamental rights and gives priority to multinationals profits over social, environmental and democratic interests. Read the joint press release in English or in French. See the Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of undisclosed know-how and business information (trade secrets).
