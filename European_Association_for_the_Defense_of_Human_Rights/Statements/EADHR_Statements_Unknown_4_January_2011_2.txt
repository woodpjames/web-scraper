    Français (French) The International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers should be ratified by the European Union and its Member States. It is unacceptable that no country has signed this Convention over the past twenty years. Today, the new Treaty gives the EU a legal personality and, thereby, the possibility to ratify the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families (ICRMW). Thus, on the occasion of its twentieth anniversary1, the AEDH wishes the EU would ratify this document and initiate, without any further delay, a legislative process in this direction.
