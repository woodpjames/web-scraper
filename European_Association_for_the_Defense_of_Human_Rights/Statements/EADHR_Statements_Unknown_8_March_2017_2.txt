    Français (French) This year’s International Women’s Day on the 8th of March has been dedicated by the UN to the topic “Women in the Changing World of Work : Planet 50-50 by 2030”. On this occasion, the governments of member states are invited to make specific commitments to put an end to gender inequality through a series of new measures ranging from legislation and policy, to appropriate action plans and investments on a national basis. For the European Association for the Defence of Human Rights (AEDH) addressing gender inequality is strategic for the defence and the promotion of the rights for everyone and everywhere in the world. As of 1995, the Beijing Declaration made the rationale of the pursuit of gender equality clear : it is “not only a demand for simple justice or democracy but can also be seen as a necessary condition for women’s interests to be taken into account”.1 In reality, there is still a long way to go. If one takes as an example the present composition of the governments of the 28 EU member states, only within the governments of Sweden, France and Slovenia the rate of 50 % isreached. 7 member states have attained a rate of 30 %., while in Hungary the 12 ministers are all men. In Malta and the Czech Republic, only one of 17 ministers is female. Some days ago, during a debate in the European Parliament on the gender pay gap, that is standing at an average of 16,7 % in the European Union 2 , a Member of Parliament argued that “women must earn less than men because they are weaker, smaller and less intelligent !” 3 Is this free, confident speech, where someone was feeling empowered to publicly make such absurd and scandalous comments, a sign of times to come, where women’s rights have become a target ? The answer is yes and it must be opposed. AEDH expects the relevant authorities of the European Parliament to use all the means at their disposal to sanction the author of these remarks. AEDH wishes that the fight towards a greater equality between women and men throughall available means, EU regulations and directives, national legislation and action programmes, becomes a strong European ambition and daily commitment.
