    Français (French) Following the presentation by Commissioner Reding of the objectives of the new legislative framework for personal data protection, AEDH calls on MEPs to ensure full protection of citizens’ fundamental rights. AEDH condemns the approach presented by the European Commission which considers personal data protection as a means to achieve economic growth rather than as a fundamental right. In January 2012, the European Commission proposed a reform of the directive 95/46/CE, which constituted until now the basis for personal data protection, in the form of a global regulation on data protection 2012/001 (COD), supplemented by directive 2012/0010 (COD) concerning the processing of personal data by competent authorities in the area of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters. The interparliamentary meeting of the Committee on “Civil liberties, justice and home affairs” on the 9th and 10th of October that gave Ms. Reding the opportunity to present the objectives of the Commission, was held in the context of the first reading of the Commission’s proposals in the Parliament.
