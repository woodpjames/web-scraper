    Français (French) The European Commission has just released a green paper on the subject of prisons. The European Association for the Defense of Human Rights (AEDH) welcomes this initiative in an area where the respect of human rights is vital. The Commission widely justifies its competence on this issue, which extends to technical questions and procedures, including when it comes to evoking the European arrest warrant, whereas a recent report was highly critical about its scope of application.
