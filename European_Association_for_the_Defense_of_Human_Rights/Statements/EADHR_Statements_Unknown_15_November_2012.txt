    Français (French) Over the past year, AEDH has been examining the situation of Roma people in Europe. In October 2012, AEDH published the report “Roma people in Europe in the 21st century: violence, exclusion, insecurity” denouncing the physical violence towards Roma populations from the European states and the European citizens. The genesis of this report stemmed from the European Commission’s communication on April 5th, 2011, which launched a European framework for national Roma integration strategies. The goal of the Commission’s initiative was to encourage EU member states to implement Roma inclusion policies and to fight against social discrimination that Roma people suffer in four particular areas: access to education, to employment, to housing and to health care. However, these strategies did not address other forms of discrimination and violence suffered by Roma people in Europe.
