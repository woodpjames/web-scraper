    Français (French) Our organisations acknowledge the improvements in the second phase of legislative harmonisation but remain concerned about a number of key aspects of the asylum package in particular with regard to the detention of asylum seekers, legal assistance to asylum seekers in increasingly complex asylum procedures, the lack of sufficient procedural safeguards with regard to vulnerable asylum seekers and the detrimental impact of the Dublin Regulation on the fundamental rights of asylum seekers.
