    Français (French) Brussels, 30 September 2014 On Tuesday, 23 September, the Spanish government announced the withdrawal of the much disputed plans to restrict the Spanish abortion law. The proposed law would have allowed for the restriction of abortion to the cases of rape or severe health risks to the mother. The governments’ plans had sparked massive protests from civil society in Spain and across Europe in the past months. The withdrawal of the draft law is a victory for the right of women to choose. It is an important signal for the rights of women not only in Spain, but all over Europe. It shows us what we citizens can achieve when uniting to step up for the defence of the rights of everyone. AEDH defends a woman’s right to freely and responsibly choose whether she wants to become a parent. For her to do so, appropriate services and support must be ensured as well as access to safe abortion procedures if she so chooses. We oppose any regulation that calls into question the ability of women to decide what is right for them and we will continue to fight against this restriction of freedom.
