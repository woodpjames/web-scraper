    Français (French) 31 March 2015 – In a joint press release, the European Association for the Defence of Human Rights (AEDH), the Euro-Mediterranean Network for Human Rights (EMHRN), the World Organization Against Torture (OMCT), FIDH (International Federation for Human Rights) and their member organisations strongly condemn the law, aptly dubbed the “gag law”, and reiterate their serious concerns over the growing restrictions on the right to freedoms of expression and peaceful assembly in Spain. Despite fierce opposition from civil society, all opposition parties, Spanish public opinion, as well as condemnation from the United Nations and the Council of Europe, Spain adopted last Thursday 26 March the Basic Law for the Protection of Public Security, considered by many as a black day for democracy.
