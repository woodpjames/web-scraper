    Français (French) The European         Association for the Defence of Human Rights (AEDH) notes with         concern the data breach at Europol, the European Police Office. On         Wednesday, Europol, reacting to the story of a Dutch public TV         broadcaster, has admitted that some secret files concerning         terrorist activities have been posted online as a result of a         “human error”.  Journalists         have found the information on a hard disk connected to the         Internet without any protection. According to the TV broadcast,         over 700 pages of data have been published concerning at least         54 investigations in Europe including investigations on the         attacks in Madrid in 2004. These files would contain names and         telephone numbers of suspects. The cause of this breach would be         the copy of the data to a personal hard disk by a police         officer.  AEDH has         always raised concerns on the creation of new databases with the         aim to watch more and more people. A recent example of this         tendency is the data base Titres Electroniques Sécurisés (TES)         in France, a file with biometric data of over 60 million people.         The risks AEDH warned from are today proven on a large scale.         This does not mean that cases of a more limited scale that occur         on a more frequent basis are less dramatic for the victims of         these breaches.  The incident         raises the important question of security of data and         appropriate technical measures having a considerable impact on         the rights of exposed persons.  Even if the         breach was not ill-intentioned, it shows that it is impossible         to secure data collection. At the same time, data collection is         getting more and more important contrary to what the advocates         of constantly increasing surveillance would have us believe.  AEDH is         surprised that Europol pretends that the breach will have no         impact on ongoing investigations, although at this point, no         statement in this regard can be made.  By contrast,         what is clear is that such a breach constitutes a very strong         violation of the right to privacy and of the presumption of         innocence of people involved.
