    Français (French) On the occasion of the vote by the European Parliament of the EU-Armenia readmission agreement, AEDH reiterates its strong opposition to the development of the EU’s readmission policy, even if this policy incorporates small concessions in terms of visa facilitation for the third countries concerned. The AEDH’s reserves and criticisms, like those of many other organizations, concern both the risk of non-respect of migrant rights – or even their endangerment – and the method employed by the EU during the negotiation and implementation of the agreements. In the specific case of Armenia, AEDH would like to underline that, despite the reforms underway, the country is far from being able to guarantee the rights of readmitted migrants.
