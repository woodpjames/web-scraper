    Français (French) AEDH and the Czech Helsinki Committee (CHC) deplore that the European Parliament rejected the guidelines laid out in the first report submitted by Andrew Duff, Member of the European Parliament (ALDE – UK) on the implementation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union in the Czech Republic.  We call upon European Parliament and Council to give a negative advice on the exclusion of CzechRepublic from the scope of application of the Charter.
