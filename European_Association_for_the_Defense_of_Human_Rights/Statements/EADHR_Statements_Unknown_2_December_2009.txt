A motion for rejection of the European Parliament to denounce the denial of democracy in the setting up of the new European Police Office Europol – Press release, 2 December 2009
2 December 2009
On the eve of the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, the Council of the European Union adopted on November 30, 2009, four draft decisions on the setting up of the European Police Office Europol on January 1, 2010 . This haste has led the European Parliament to vote a motion for rejection of those draft decisions  in order to denounce the denial of democracy. The ordinary legislative co decision procedure established by the Lisbon Treaty should have been the obvious solution since the new Treaty was about to enter into force, but Member States disregarded it and imposed their choice against the MEPs’ opinion. The press release is available in English and French.
