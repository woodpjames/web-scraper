    Français (French) Daphne Caruana Galizia, a famous Maltese anti-corruption journalist and blogger has been cowardly murdered on 16 October 2017 by a bomb placed under her car. Daphne Caruana Galizia was an active whistleblower: in 2016, she notably revealed the Maltese-side of the Panama Papers scandal. The European Association for the Defence of Human Rights (AEDH) joins the Maltese Association for the Defense of Human Rights (MAHR) and strongly condemns this despicable act. For AEDH, an attack targeting a whistleblower, as was Daphne Caruana Galizia, is a direct attack on freedom of expression. Like MAHR, AEDH calls the Maltese Government and its institutions for justice to be done. The unfortunate event reminds us all of the whistleblowers’ and investigative journalists’ vulnerability while their work helps defending human rights. This is also a reminder of the need to improve and harmonise the protection of whistleblowers across the European Union. Hence, AEDH supports the work initiated by the European Commission on this matter. AEDH expresses its support and conveys its deepest condolences to the family of Daphne Caruana Galizia and her loved ones. A silent vigil will be held tonight at 6 pm in front of the International Press Center in Brussels. Other similar events are and will be organised in the European Union. AEDH invites citizens to join these gatherings in order to pay a final tribute to Daphne Caruana Galizia. Annex: MAHR press release
