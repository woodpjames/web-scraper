    Français (French) 27 March 2017 – Yet again, the acts of death willed by terrorists has struck. The European Association for the Defence of Human Rights (AEDH) expresses all its compassion and solidarity to the victims and their families After Paris, Brussels, Nice, Berlin, the attack was perpetrated in the heart of a European capital. In no manner does it mean that these attacks are secondary to other locations. But the attack in London reminds us that as Isis loses ground, it retains the possibility of terrorising, with few means and for maximum efficiency. The ultimate goal is the division of societies by reactions of anger and collective rejection. AEDH will not accept that people are stigmatised for their suspected or actual origin. Together, let’s defend an open society based on the values of solidarity, democracy and fundamental rights. AEDH calls for the presumed authors to be apprehended and taken to court. It calls upon the vigilance of citizens in the United Kingdom and all EU countries, to avoid summary proceedings that could affect the credibility of justice. The legitimate fight against terrorism and terrorists does not emerge strengthened when freedoms are sacrificed in the name of security. Thus, AEDH calls on civil society in European countries to act on their governments, for solidarity and the defence of freedoms are the guiding lights in the fight against terrorism.
