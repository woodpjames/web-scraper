    Français (French) 25 July 2015 – The UN Human Rights Council adopted on June 25 its final report ending the second universal periodic review mechanism involving Spain.  The Council issued 198 recommendations to ameliorate the Human Rights situation on the Spanish soil, but the Iberian Peninsula only accepted to implement 169: 20 alarming and strongly mediatized situations of human rights’ violations go out of the window.  In her speech before the UN Human Rights Council, the ambassador of the Spanish government delegation made it clear that some essential UN recommendations will not be taken into account.  These concern the abolition of the “secret detention” regime, which provides for terrorism or organised crime suspects to be detained up to 13 days without being able to meet a lawyer or a doctor of their choice, nor to contact their families. This regime goes against the right to a fair trial. The Spanish government will also ignore the recommendations to guarantee access to the asylum at the frontiers, or to restore the universal jurisdiction permitting the Spanish courts to judge people, independently of their nationality, over serious crimes of international law. The Institut de Drets Humans de Catalunya (IDHC), organisation for the defence of Human Rights and AEDH member, which participated in the United Nations’ Human Rights Committee’s meeting, deplores these shortfalls and pointed out that it seems difficult for Spain to implement the recommendations on freedom of speech and of reunion, while maintaining the Ley de Seguridad Ciudadana, or to mitigate the effects of the crisis on social and economic rights while refusing to study the impacts of the government’s austerity measures.
