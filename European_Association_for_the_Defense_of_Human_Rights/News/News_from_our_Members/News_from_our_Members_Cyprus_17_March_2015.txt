    Français (French) 13 March 2015 – In the framework of cooperation for the creation of a European programme against hate speech,  a meeting between representatives of KISA and the Chief of Police, Mr. Zacharias Chrysostomou, took place. During the meeting, it was pointed out that there was a need to make an effort to develop constructive relations between KISA and the police, on the basis of respect for the organisation’s mandate and action in society and the protection of human rights. The Chief of police stated that “the role of KISA, and other civil society organisations, to criticise where it is required is both understandable and welcome”, adding “that there is no such thing as bad-faith criticism since all criticism is necessary and useful”.
