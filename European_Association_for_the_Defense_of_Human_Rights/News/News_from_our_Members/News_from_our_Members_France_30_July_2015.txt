    Français (French) Close to 4000 forced evacuations of Roms happened in the first semester 2015 in France. More than the evacuation, the seizure of the goods belonging to the dispossessed persons makes their situation even more precarious. Despite the numerous calls from the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) of the UN and by the Commissioner of Human Rights of the Council of Europe Mr Muižnieks, the French authorities keep applying a line of conduct yet infringing the very legislation of the state. LDH France asks the French authorities to suspend the systematic expulsions and to find the adequate solutions that respect Human Rights.  Read the press release of LDH.
