    Français (French) The Asociación Pro Derechos Humanos en Andalucía (APDHA) published a report on Algeria and the situation of  migration in this country. Algeria is one of the main countries where migrants cross from Africa to Europe, and more particularly from Africa to Spain. These migrants, who want to settle in Algeria or to find a way to reach Europe, are victims of serious violations of their fundamental rights. The report analyses on one hand the rights of the immigrants and the sub-Saharan refugees once they have arrived in Algeria and, on the other hand, the situation of the Algerians who decide to migrate irregularly to Spain. In both cases, migrants are victims of severe violations of human rights, including physical and/or psychological attacks by the Algerian police and the organized criminal groups. Through this report, APDHA highlights the necessity for Algeria to immediately develop and implement a national legislation according to international human rights instruments that the country has ratified. APDHA also asks for a radical change of the EU migration policies which are solely aimed at protecting its borders. Read the article (In Spanish only) Read the report (In Spanish only)
