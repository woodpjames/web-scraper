This petition describes the unlimited extension of computer filing and its dangers, for private life as well as through its hidden goals of population selection, recalls the legal provisions which should strictly frame it, and enunciate the measures to take to do it, beggining with the recognition of an effective right to object. It is supported by 27 national organizations militating in the field of human rights and democratic liberties, of which the League of human rights, as well as more than 50 personnalities of  various backgrounds.
