    Français (French) On September 10, 2015, LDH sent a letter to the French President on the subject of the migration crisis, co-signed by French and international associations such as Migreurop, Euromed rights – EMHRN or Médecins du Monde. LDH called the French government to support a general welcoming plan for refugees in all the countries of the European Union. LDH also asks for a suspension of Dublin agreements pending a revision of the text by the European Parliament. The letter is divided into three points: in first instance emergency measures must be taken by the French Government for refugees already living on the French territory, secondly, the EU member states must improve the relocation process of refugees arriving on European continent, and thirdly, an upstream work should be done concerning the people who undertake to make the long journey to Europe.
