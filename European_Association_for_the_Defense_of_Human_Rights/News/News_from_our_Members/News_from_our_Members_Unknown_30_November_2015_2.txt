    Fran√ßais (French) 17 November 2015 According to the Government, the association No Border would have prompted migrants to rebel against the security forces, urging them to block the trucks going to England or to refuse alternative accommodation proposals. For years, the No Border movement worked in solidarity with the migrants of Calais, through actions of all kind. Unlike other associations present on the ground, No Border provides material help, administrative and health assistance as well as legal advice.  LDH only wishes to remind the government of a simple question: which side is violence coming from?  All these people have fled the war and are forced to live in inhumane conditions without any kind of legal assistance.  Is the violence not rather on the side of the French authorities that let refugees drift away for years and that condone all charges from major entities defending human rights such as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)?  LDH denounces the false and unfounded accusations of the French government at the expense of the real suffering of the concerned individuals and wishes to show its support to organizations such as No Border who strive to provide concrete solutions to the situation of migrants in the Calais camp.
