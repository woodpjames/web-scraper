    Français (French) Following several acts and words illustrating the resurgence of racism and anti-Semitism in France, the League for Human Rights and other French organisations are calling for demonstration, on November 30th, against racism and to defend the idea of a fraternal, united and mixed-race France where every individual can live in equal dignity. Outraged by these phenomena that offend Human rights, civil society has decided to unite to allow an important citizen reaction. Thus, this walk will take place not only in Paris but also throughout France and in Dom Com. LDH condemns the racist tendencies and does not accept that millions of people are denied their humanity and their citizenship because of their origin, social status, culture, religion, etc. For more information (in French): –	Common call of LDH and other organisations –	Facebook event
