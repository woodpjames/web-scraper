    Français (French) 08 October 2015 – The French LDH, EuroMed Rights, Migreurop, and other organisations stated that the impunity of the Moroccan and Spanish governments on the increasing externalisation of the migrant political “management” must stop. The signatories of the statement also called on Morocco to stop blocking the road to sub-Saharan and Syrian migrants who are legitimately entitled to seek asylum in Europe. Some of them are arrested or even detained on the border of Beni Ansar, enabling the proliferation of human trafficking. Ten years after the murders of several migrants by the border police in Ceuta and Melilla in Spain, LDH and 12 other organisations are demanding the respect of migrants’ dignity in the areas in which they are passing through in order to reach Europe via the south of Spain.
