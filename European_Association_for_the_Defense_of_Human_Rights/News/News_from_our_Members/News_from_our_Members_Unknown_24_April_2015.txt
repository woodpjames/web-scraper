    Français (French) 24 April 2015 – The Observatory of Digital Freedoms (OLN) – whose LDH is a founding member – is calling for a big gathering against the French Intelligence Bill on May 4th2015 from 18:30, Esplanade des Invalides (Paris). As French MPs will vote this bill on 5th May, the OLN reminds – together with other signatory organisations such as ATTAC or Amnesty International – that this text is a threat to freedom and places the citizens at real risk of intelligence agencies monitoring, almost without any control, and endangers all social and political mobilisations.
