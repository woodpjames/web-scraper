    Français (French) 07 January 2016 – ARCI denounces the hypocrisy of the European Union and the Italian government towards migrants, who are entitled to apply for asylum, but receive no explanation on how to ask for it and do not benefit from legal assistance services. Indeed, the association has collected testimonies from migrants who report being forced to sign papers immediately upon arrival without translation or report being abandoned at the station of Agrigento with only a decree of refusal of asylum in hand – a completely illegitimate and unconstitutional decree according to the Sicilian support associations for migrants.  ARCI denounces the absurdity of European migration policies, which if they do not abandon migrants to their fate with a simple refusal in hand, locks them up in "Hot Spots" that play the role of prisons for those who have committed the "crime of being illegal" (see separate press release on the subject of ARCI).  ARCI recalls that the right of asylum can be requested anywhere and by anyone regardless of its origin. This fundamental right is violated when one refuses to grant it to certain migrants on the basis of their so-called "safe country of origin."  ARCI calls for an immediate and effective access to international protection for migrants, the closure of the Hot Spots of Lampedusa, the prohibition to issue deportation orders and ultimately ask for the European Union to open its eyes on the situation of migrants in the Mediterranean.
