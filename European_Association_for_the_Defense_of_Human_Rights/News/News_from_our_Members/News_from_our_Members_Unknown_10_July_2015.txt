    Français (French) 10 July 2015- KISA, organisation for the defence of Human Rights and AEDH member, condemns the indecisive and hesitating attitude of the police towards violent acts against migrant women in Cyprus.  While police violence against migrants is commonplace in Cyprus, KISA worries about a new form of discriminatory attitude within the security forces. Using the recent example of a Sri Lankan woman domestic worker, KISA shows to what point the police breaches its obligations. This housekeeper worked full-time for elderly women during seven years. After moving into the family home, the employer’s son started to threaten and abuse verbally and physically both the housekeeper and his mother. The police officers’ intervention was woefully insufficient: they didn’t arrest the aggressor, and even allowed him to stay in the family house while asking both the women to move out, without any extra protection measure. Their behaviour confirmed the perpetrator’s acts and weakened, even more, the victim. Between excessive tolerance and discrimination, it is obvious that the police fails to do its job: it does not properly protect victims, and leaves aggressors unpunished. This deplorable attitude becomes widespread and contributes to the recent increase of violent cases on the islands. The organisation calls on the police to treat people equally and to take effective measures to protect victims of violence regardless of their residency status and ethnic origin.
