Member News: Call for mobilisation by APDHA
24 September 2013
AEDH member Asociación Pro Derecho Humanos de Andalucía (ADPHA) and various Moroccan associations call to mobilise for the victims of the “unjust war” against migrants at the gates of Europe. The organisations organise a joint caravane from Tanger to the Spanish enclave of Ceuta on October 6th. The purpose of this action is to pay tribute to the victims of the event of 2005, when fourteen persons trying to cross the frontier between Morocco and Spain lost their lives in the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla, most of them being killed by Spanish and Moroccan authorities. The day before the caravane, on October 5th, documentaries will be showed followed by discussions, debates and a testimony from a member of the Associations of Senegalese from Tanger. The APDHA invites everyone who wishes to join them to participate in this event.
