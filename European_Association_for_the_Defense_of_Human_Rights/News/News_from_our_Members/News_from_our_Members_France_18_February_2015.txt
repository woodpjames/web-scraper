    Français (French) 17 February 2015 – The presidents of the 33 associations of the “Collectif des associations unies”, of which the French Human Rights League is part, have called for a general mobilisation of public authorities and of the society as a whole against poverty and poor quality housing. In the context of the housing crisis and of an increasing poverty with 8.5 million people living below the poverty line, the Presidents call for a more ambitious policy that would finally make the right to housing and accommodation more effective. They also emphasize the need to develop a new plan to fight against poverty in order to improve the living conditions of people living in precarious situations.
