    Français (French) On the occasion of the International Migrants Day, several activities have been organized in the Member States. The International Migrants Day is celebrated on 18 December to commemorate the adoption of the “International convention on the protection of the rights of migrant workers and members of their families” of 18th December 1990. The EU Member States have not yet ratified the convention. Thus, the Belgian “Ligue des Droits de l’Homme” (LDH), with a group of Afghans as well as the people and organizations that support them, invite all citizens on 18 December to a friendly "manifête" and rally (place du Begijnhof, Brussels). The “Asociación Pro Derechos Humanos de Andalucía” (APDHA) has joint the “Institutional platform against violence against migrants”, which denounces “Fortress Europe” and has organized several activities in Seville. The French “Ligue des droits de l’Homme et du Citoyen” (LDH) has joint the call of  “United against a disposable immigration” (UCIJ) which invites the citizens to demonstrate on 18 December under the slogan "French and foreigners, together against precariousness, for respect and equal rights ". Finally, ARCI participates in the campaign "L’Italia sono anch’io", which has organized a public initiative in Rome on 18 December. The Minister for Integration, Cecile Kyenge, and the President of the Constitutional Affairs’ Committee of the Parliament, Francesco Paolo Sisto, will participate in the initiative. Other events will take place in the EU Member States as well as in third countries.
