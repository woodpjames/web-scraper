France condemned by the ECtHR for eviction of Travellers
24 October 2013
On 17th October, the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) condemned France for the expulsion of a camp of Travellers without providing adequate alternative housing. The Court concluded that France violated Article 8 of the Convention and recalled that the loss of a home is one of the most serious violations to the respect for private and family life and home. The Ligue des Droits de lâ€™Homme welcomes such a conclusion and hopes that the French government will understand the crucial importance of that judgment.
