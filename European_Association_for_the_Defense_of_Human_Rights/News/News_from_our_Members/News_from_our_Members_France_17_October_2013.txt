France: The right to an effective remedy may be at risk
17 October 2013
The French League for Human Rights (LDH) asks for the removal from the Decree of 13 August 2013 of the provisions that will deprive labor and social disputes of the benefit of the two-stage procedure. In this way, the judgments regarding benefits, grants, housing and social rights will no longer be subject to the right to appeal, thus violating the right to an effective remedy.
