    Français (French) On the 1st of june 2016, the International Observatory of Prisons (IOP) denounced the implementation of a modification in labour, which is not defined precisely, but that leads the IOP to think that it could have an impact on the working time in prisons. The living conditions of the prisoners during strikes have been criticised. The Belgian State and the Minister of Justice have been notified by the European Committee for the prevention of torture, and also condemned by Belgian jurisdictions for the lack of guaranteed service during the strikes. The indifference of Belgian authorities regarding this unique crisis has shocked the IOP. The IOP regrets the lack of means implemented to guarantee the living conditions of the prisoners. http://www.liguedh.be/espace-presse/135-communiques-de-presse-2016/2636-greves-en-prison–le-protocole-est-un-jeu-de-dupes-
