    Français (French) EDRI (European Digital RIghts) sent an open letter signed by a relatively high number of organisations working on data protection, related to the recast of the Data retention Directive. This open letter establishes different conditions to be absolutely fulfilled in the impact assessment of the directive as well as in the recast proposal which will result from it if the Commission wants to be in line with the provisions of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
