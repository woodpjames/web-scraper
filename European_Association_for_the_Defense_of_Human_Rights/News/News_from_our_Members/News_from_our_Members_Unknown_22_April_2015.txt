Taking part in the European and global outcry or the appalling loss of life, KISA raises its voice too, condemns EU migratory policy and calls on the EU to, rather than building walls and erecting barbed wires in order to exclude these people from its borders, to rise to the occasion and put the declarations into praxis and to finally take effective action so that we stop being witnessed to such tragedies.
