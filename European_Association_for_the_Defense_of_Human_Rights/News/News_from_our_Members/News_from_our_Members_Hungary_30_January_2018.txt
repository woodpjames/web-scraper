The Hungarian Helsinki Committee, Hungary â€“ Resisting ill democracies in Europe
30 January 2018
From emerging democracies in transition, illiberal governments have rapidly transformed Hungary and Poland into ill democracies, have attempted to do so in Croatia, and are slowly and carefully entertaining an illiberal platform in Serbia, according to the new case study Resisting Ill Democracies in Europe. The findings, published by a group of human rights organisations, including the Hungarian Helsinki Committee, were presented during a conference at the European Parliament.
