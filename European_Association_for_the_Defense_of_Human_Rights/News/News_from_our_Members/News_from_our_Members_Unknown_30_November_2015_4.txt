    Français (French) 03 November 2015 It has now been two years since Piotr Piskozub died in the shelter where he spent the night after he went out of the hospital in Seville on 02 October 2013. The medico-legal autopsy indicates that he suffered from tuberculous pneumonia, kidney and liver diseases, and that his body weight was only 12,6kg / m2.  How could the hospital not realise the seriousness of his case a few hours only before his death?  According to APDHA, a form of discrimination by medical workers and a lack of information on patients living in the street is the source of cases such as that of Piotr Piskozub.  This discrimination encourages nurses and emergency doctors to label the homeless of "social issues" upon their arrival at the hospital and not to provide the adequate care to their situation.  APDHA denounces this discrimination and incompetence of medical services in the region to recognize a serious health case and treat the person as a priority until full recovery, regardless of its social status.  Piotr Piskozub’s case was archived by the investigating judge without a criminal charge, but APDHA denounces here those directly responsible for its avoidable death. Read the press release
