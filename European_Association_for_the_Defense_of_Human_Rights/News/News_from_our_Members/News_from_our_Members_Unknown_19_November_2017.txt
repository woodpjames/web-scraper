    Français (French) The Italian League for Human Rights (LIDU) continues to actively pursue its work for the promotion of human rights, including in detention centres. For years, LIDU has been attentive to what is happening there through the dissemination of analyses and the promotion of civil actions towards Italian and international public institutions. Recently, Simspe Onlus Association – a medical and sanitary penitentiary society, carried out an initiative called Agorà penitenziaria that deals with the extension of the application of Essential Levels of Assistance (LEA) to the prison health system. The initiative requires treatments given in the penitentiary services respect the principles provided in the Italian Constitution and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. LIDU closely followed the animated debates at the 3-day Congress on the penitentiary environment. This is a very positive event which, in continuity with other initiatives in the penitentiary area, can lead to concrete improvements in the way the difficult world of the Italian prison environment is managed and understood. LIDU believes that the Agora initiative is the beginning of a change of course and a success built on the willingness of associative groups trying to break the wall of indifference of the public, the State and finally politicians. We offer them our whole support.
