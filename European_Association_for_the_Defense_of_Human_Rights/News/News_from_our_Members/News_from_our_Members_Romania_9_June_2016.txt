    Fran√ßais (French) On the 5th of june 2016, elections of the local public administration took place in Romania. The Association Pro Democracy (APD) has mobilized  800 observers for these elections, to make sure that the law is applied correctly and respected by the different institutional actors, politicians and by the civil society. When it was judged necessary, recommendations were made to improve the voting system. For instance, in 2 localities (Verne?ti and Alexandria) the elections had to be interrupted due to printing mistakes on the ballots. The APD called for a  renewal of the elections. Other dysfunctions have been observed, such as the lack of ballots in certain regions (Snagov) or the continuation of electoral campaigns on the day of the vote(in Arge?, Ilfov, Sibiu, Cara?-Severin, Bihor, Ialomi?a). Some of the observers were mistreated. One of the worst case was listed in Sighisoara, were the observer was threatened.
