Belgium: Manifesto for the support of Roma families
23 October 2013
On 16th October, several associations, including the Ligue belge des droits de l’Homme, Médecins du Monde and Ciré (Coordination et initiatives pour réfugiés et étrangers) called on politicians to sign a manifesto to support Roma families living in the Region of Brussels and in Belgium more generally, to ensure they enjoy their property rights. The President of the Ligue des droits de l’Homme, Alexis Deswaef, recalled that Roma people are European citizens and that they have a right to a residence permit if they register with the municipality and have an employment contract. Convinced that Roma can integrate in our society, the associations involved also called for the creation of a task force to ensure the coordination and support for families as well as the development of sustainable solutions.
