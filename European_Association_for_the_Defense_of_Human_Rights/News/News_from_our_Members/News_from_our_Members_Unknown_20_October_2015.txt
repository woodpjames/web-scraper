    Français (French) 20 October 2015 – APDHA wishes to share its satisfaction regarding the adoption of a bill on the opening of a 24/24 medical emergency unit in hospitals. The opening of these units would guarantee that people in need also get social care while in recovery. The purpose of this bill is to promote equal access to medical and social assistance for the homeless, often the most disadvantaged persons. The idea was launched in 2013 following the death of a young homeless person, Piotr Piskozub. The young man died for unknown reasons following a short stay at the hospital. APDHA published in April 2015 a report called “What is happening with homeless people at emergencies and what should happen?” This report points out the invisibility of homeless people in our societies and the lack of consideration of government towards them. In this press release, APHA lists the points on which the government has yet to work. Among them: the improvement of reintegration of the homeless person projects in society and in the labour market, the consolidation of basic resources for the homeless in convalescence and the training of medical assistants to the recognition of serious situations.
