    Français (French) 6 March 2015 – The Belgian League of Human Rights (LDH) and the organisation CIRÉ (Coordination and Initiatives for Refugees and Foreigners) remain committed to the fight against the existence of the detention centres, and see in the latest developments an additional reason to be vigilant about what is going on out there, behind closed doors. Open Access Now  campaign, coordinated by an international platform of associations, including the Belgian organizations LDH and CIRÉ, demands the closure of detention centres for foreigners since 2011. In the meantime, it requires more transparency on what is going on in those centres, especially through an unconditional access for civil society and the media to the centres themselves, as well as information about their functioning and the treatment of detainees.
