    Français (French) Luxembourg, 14 March 2016 – The state of emergency situation is provided under article 32 paragraph 4 of the Constitution since 2004.  In January 2016, a proposal for revision was submitted to the State Council. In its recommendation, the Luxembourgish League of Human Rights alerts to the risks for the respect of fundamental rights, a balanced separation of powers and the rule of law. It advocates the need for an appropriate jurisdictional control in order to prevent abuses and arbitrariness of the executive power. The state of emergency and terrorist threats must not be used to undermine and circumvent legal obligations and preeminence of human rights. The document is only available in French.
