Almost a year and a half later, under presser of parties’ lawyers, the Federal Prosecutor Harald Range has announced that he will not open an investigation on German authorities for the moment, pretending a lack of evidence.

A press release published on July 14 asks the Federal Prosecutor to fulfil his duties with regard to Justice and to start, without delay, an official enquiry in order for him to gather missing pieces of evidence.
