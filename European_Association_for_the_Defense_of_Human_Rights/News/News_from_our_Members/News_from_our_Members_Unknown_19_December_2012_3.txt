    Français (French) The APDHA (Asociación Pro Derechos Humanos de Andalucía) launches a political campaign that aims at drawing the attention of Spanish, Moroccan and European institutions on the humiliations suffered by the carrier women who transport merchandises through the border between Morocco and Ceuta and Melilla and on the violation of their human rights.  On the 22nd of April 2012, a number of Spanish and Moroccan non-governmental organisations joined in Tetouan, Morocco, to discuss this important matter and adopt a joint declaration, which serves as a basis for this campaign.
