    Français (French) 13 October 2015 – The Chamber of Deputies approves the reform of the law on citizenship, which must now pass the Senate for a second reading. For AEDH and ARCI members, this reform is a first step forward with regard to the extreme rigidity of the Italian government regarding the rights of migrants. The organisation argues that it is time the government takes into account the evolving social realities of the country. The campaign “Italia sono anch’io” (“I am also Italy”) launched in 2011 has been successful in raising more than 20,000 signatures. But according to ARCI, some elements of the law still need to be modified such as the absence of a standard for the simplification of the procedures of the naturalisation of adults, or even the jus soli for children born on Italian territory. Therefore, the campaign “L’Italia sono anch’io” hopes that at the next reading, the Senate will make the changes that are necessary in order to erase the long-lasting discrimination against foreigners in Italy.
