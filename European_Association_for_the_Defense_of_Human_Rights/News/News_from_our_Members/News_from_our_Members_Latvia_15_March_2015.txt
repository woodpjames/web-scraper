    Français (French) 15 March 2015 – Every year, Latvian veterans who fought in the Waffen SS against the Soviet Army during the Second World War (*) parade through the old town of Riga to national memorial of Liberty to lay flowers. The Latvian Human Rights Committee (LHRC) denounces the celebration of the collaborators often presented as “heroes” by one of the parties in power – the “National Alliance” – whose deputies attend the march every year. Read the LHRC press release and its recommendations to the Latvian government (in English only) (*) For the record, Latvia was occupied by the Red Army after the German-Soviet pact of 1939. After the attack of Germany against the Soviet Union in 1941, the Red Army was driven out of the Baltic republic. The Latvian Legion of the Waffen SS has long been controversial. Moscow and the Russian minority in Latvia see it as a glorification of Nazism, while veterans and their supporters argue that the legionnaires were not Nazis, but that they were fighting for independence.
