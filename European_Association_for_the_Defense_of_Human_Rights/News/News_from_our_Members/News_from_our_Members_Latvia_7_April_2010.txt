Legal Information Centre for Human Rights (LICHR): Publication of the new book “Chance to Survive: Minority Rights in Estonia and Latvia” – 7 April 2010
7 April 2010
The Legal Information Centre for Human Rights is glad to inform you about the new book “Chance to Survive: Minority Rights in Estonia and Latvia” (ed. Vadim Poleshchuk). The study has been ordered by the Foundation for Historical Outlook to the Legal Information Centre for Human Rights (Estonia) and the Latvian Human Rights Committee. The objective of the book was to give the broadest possible description of the situations in Estonia and Latvia from the standpoint of the protection of minority rights and the prevention of discrimination. The book provides basic statistical data on the living conditions of the non-Estonian and non-Latvian populations, and surveys briefly the policies of Estonia and Latvia in the sphere of ethnic relations, migration, and the prevention of discrimination based on race, ethnic origin, and religion. The authors also presented information on the realisation of the civil and political rights of minorities (special attention is paid to their participation in political and public activities, their access to the judicial system and to certain basic civil freedoms). The positions of minorities on the labour market and in the educational systems are examined in more detail, and several other aspects of the economic, cultural, and social rights situation are also explored. The book reflects the situation as of the early 2008 and supplies more recent data as far as possible. The study is available here.
