    Français (French) 3 February 2018 – The Italian League of Human Rights wishes to take position on the law approved by the Polish Parliament in the Chamber of Deputies last 26 January, on the eve of the Day of Memory, and in the Senate on 1 February. The new law provides for up to three years imprisonment for people who mention Auschwitz, Birkenau and other Nazi extermination sites located in Poland as Polish death camps. The fact is that many camps were located on Polish territory, this is undeniable. Even though these extermination camps were set up and run by German Nazis, we would like to denounce the fact that this law represents an explicit manifestation of anti-Semitism, a sentiment that has persisted for centuries in a large part of Polish public opinion. It seems to us equally indisputable that such a law could call into question the free debate about the persecution of Jews in Poland by the German Nazis but also by a large part of the local population. We would also like to point out that a large number of officially recognized 6706 Polish citizens helped Jews to hide or escape during the Nazi persecutions. The Italian League for Human Rights reaffirms its support for the right and duty to remember criminal acts against Jews; whatever the place, by whom these crimes were committed or who was complicit, whether they were Germans, Poles, Italians or of any other nationality. We hope that the President of the Republic, Andrzej Duda, will refuse the ratification of this law because the objective truth must keep its place in the memory of all the citizens of the world.
