    Français (French) 26 November 2015 KISA deplores the link that some international and Cypriot media are establishing between refugees and terrorists. On the island of Cyprus, the migrants from the base of Dhekelia are the most concerned. Several news have been published  recently, of which one commented on  the “suspicious” disappearance of five migrants from the camp, linked them directly to terrorist organisations and declared them ‘dangerous’ for the inhabitants of the island. TKISA denounces the falsification of data in certain documents and calls on journalists to respect the journalistic code of ethics in order not to participate in the dissemination of racist and xenophobic ideas.  It also calls on the authorities to take the necessary security measures in the respect of the rights of all without any discrimination and racial profiling and calls on the public to select information carefully, especially those concerning terrorism and refugees.
