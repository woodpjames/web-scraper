APDHA (Andalusia): A call for the respect of Human Rights in borders â€“ September, 21st 2009
23 September 2009
At least 14 people lost their lives in Ceuta and Melilla between September and October 2005, trying to cross the border fences. This is in their memory and in memory of all those who perish every day in trying to reach Europe and therefore achieve a life worthy to be lived, that the APHDA is pleased to invite you to the 5th Caravan at the Ceuta border on October, 11th  2009.
