    Français (French) 3 April 2015 – Following the suicides of two people which Belgium had denied the right of residence to, the Belgian League of Human Rights (LDH) reminds that it is high time that Belgian politicians take responsibility for the link between their political choices and the distress they produce. Denouncing the human cost of the Belgian migration policies, the LDH calls on the government to find the courage to consider migrations in a different manner and to adopt a fairer and more human approach to asylum and immigration issues.
