    Français (French) 8 April 2015 – Forced evacuations of places of living occupied by Roma people (or people designated as such) continued in France during winter 2015. On average, 110 people were weekly evacuated by the authorities. This number is not as high as in the first quarter of 2014 but the 2015 statistics reveals that the circular of 26 August 2012 – which provides guidance to prefects regarding the accompaniment of evacuation operations of illegal camps – is not applied in the majority of evacuations. In this context, the French League of Human Rights (LDH) continues to advocate the stopping of forced evacuations, which are useless, and considers them as unworthy. The League also reminds that (significant) financing dedicated to the conduct of these inhuman operations would be much more effective if it was devoted to help these people integrate in France so that they can live in peace, like any European citizen.
