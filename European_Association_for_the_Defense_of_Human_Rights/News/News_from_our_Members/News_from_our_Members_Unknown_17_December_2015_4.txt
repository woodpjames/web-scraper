    Français (French) 09 December 2015 The 2015 report of APDHA on the violation of human rights and social exclusion addresses four types of social exclusion: prisons, immigration, marginalisation and prostitution. It aims at making a state of play in each area and suggests solutions. According to the report, 42.3% of the Andalusian people are at risk of poverty and social exclusion and that number would increase by about 2% per year. In total, 3,554,175 people live at risk of poverty and the foreign population is three times more exposed than the rest of the population.  APDHA regrets that "the population is not getting out of the crisis, on the contrary, it is sinking deeper into it": unemployment has exceeded the threshold of 30% in the first semester and half of the child population is concerned by these numbers in the Andalusian region.  APDHA  is particularly concerned about the sanitary situation in prisons and refugee camps, left completely abandoned and considers that it represents a serious violation of human rights.  APDHA calls on the Spanish government to help marginalised people find their way towards social integration with dignified living conditions and also calls on the European Union to change its migration policies in compliance with the rights of migrants detained in camps at the border of the continent.
