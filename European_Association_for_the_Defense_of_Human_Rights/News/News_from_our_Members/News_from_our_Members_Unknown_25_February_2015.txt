    Français (French) 24 February 2015 – As Malta receives millions of Euros to fund maritime border control operations in collaboration with Frontex, members of the FRONTEXIT campaign (1) denounce the security obsession blinding Europe and leading to increasing numbers of deaths. The organisations of the FRONTEXIT campaign  – which calls for the suppression of the Frontex agency – find shameful that the EU’s reactions focus on strengthening mechanisms which, contrary to claims, do not aim to save human lives but to intercept and control (Frontex, Eurosur, cooperation on migration with neighbouring states, …). (1) Frontexit is a campaign led by associations, researchers and individuals from both North and South of the Mediterranean on the initiative of the Migreurop network.
