At the start of February the non-governmental organization Z§vule práva opened its helpline for Roma in the Czech Republic. The helpline provides guidance in cases of illegal discrimination and major crimes. It is part of the “Ma den pes“! (Don’t give in!) project. The helpline gives advice to people who have been the victims of major crimes and discrimination; they are told how to proceed and where to turn in order to defend their rights. The focus is particularly on Roma victims (and not only those in socially excluded locations). The helpline also methodically supports non-governmental organizations helping socially disadvantaged Roma people. The helpline offers guidance when responding to a range of illegal discriminatory acts. In extreme cases involving systemic problems with a broader social impact, Z§vule práva provides and arranges for legal aid for the victims (such as filling out the relevant legal forms and acting as legal representation for the client in selected cases). Z§vule práva also uses its experience with its clients to make recommendations and develop systemic guidelines for state institutions in the area of non-discrimination. Z§vule práva is working to defend and promote the universal accessibility of the basic principles of democracy and the rule of law. This project is funded by the Ministry of the Interior of the Czech Republic. Contact:
