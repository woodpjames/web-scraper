    Français (French) The Spanish newspaper "El diario" published yesterday (11/02/2014) an article written by Rafael Lara, APDHA’s representative and AEDH’s General Secretary, about the campaign launched by AEDH and its members in view of the European elections in May 2014. In this article Rafael Lara remarks the distance between citizens and the European institutions, which are increasingly subject to the power of economic and financial institutions. At the same time it is indisputable that the choices made by the EU have a strong impact on the lives of citizens. In this context, the AEDH’s campaign aims to remind the candidates running for the European elections that their primary task is to defend the rights of people.
