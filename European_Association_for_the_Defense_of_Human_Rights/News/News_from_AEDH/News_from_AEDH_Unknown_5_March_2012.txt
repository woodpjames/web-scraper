    Français (French) AEDH sent to the European Commission its response to the Green Paper “on the right to family reunification of third-country nationals living in the European Union (Directive 2003/86/EC)”. In its Green paper published on 15 November 2011, the European Commission launched a debate on family reunification in the EU, in particular on the implementation of the directive 2003/86/EC and on the problems that it creates at the national level, as well as on the eventual need for modification of this directive. AEDH underlines that in no way a modification of the directive on family reunification can be a pretext for undermining the protection of human rights and the rights of migrants. The approach of the Commission must be based on fundamental rights and promote an harmonization of national policies and laws, in order to guarantee clear and stable rules for third-country nationals applying for family reunification. AEDH is concerned by the fact that such a modification of the directive might lead to further restrictions of migration and of the right to family reunification.
