    Français (French) On Tuesday 12 November 2013, the representatives of AEDH and its member leagues met with some members of the European Parliament during the conference « For a Europe of Human Rights ». This conference closed the AEDH Extraordinary General Assembly of 11th and 12th November.  At the same time, the conference was the starting point of the campaign of AEDH and its members in view of the 2014 European Parliament elections “For a Europe of Human Rights”. Thus, AEDH had the opportunity to present its manifesto to the MEPs and to discuss its claims with members of the European Parliament, representatives of Member States and of the civil society. For the European Parliament Frank Engel (EPP), Rebecca Harms (Greens/EFA) and Tatjana Ždanoka (Greens/EFA) participated in the debates. AEDH delegates shared their field observations of violations of Human Rights in the key areas of the manifesto, namely Citizenship and democracy; Economic, social and cultural rights; Minority rights and the fight against discrimination; Asylum and immigration; Personal data; and Detention for violation of law. They insisted that the European Union should play a key role in the defense and promotion of Human rights. The conference enabled AEDH to promote its claims “For a Europe of Human Rights” among political decision-makers. It also enabled AEDH to develop ideas concerning the mobilization of citizens and candidates to the European Parliament around Human Rights. Such a mobilization will be the main goal of the campaign “For a Europe of Human Rights” that will involve both the national and the European level in the coming months.
