    Français (French) AEDH organises, in cooperation with the International League for Human rights (Internationale Liga für Menschenrechte) and Borderline-Europe, a seminar about the transposal of the asylum package into German legislation. The seminar will take place on Friday 12th December 2014 in Berlin. In June 2013, after years of negotiations between the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union, the EU adopted the reform of the Common European Asylum System defining the competences and obligations of member states as regards the asylum procedure. Despite the ambition to create a common asylum system, the asylum package leaves a substantial scope for member states when transposing the directives which can result in disparities in the rights of asylum seekers. Therefore AEDH with its member leagues have decided to explain to the national human rights association the key aspects of the asylum package in order to help them in the implementation of this directive. Germany is currently taking measures to implement the directive which must be completed by 20 July 2015.
