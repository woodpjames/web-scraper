15 February 2010 – AEDH signs the text “towards a structured framework for European civil dialogue”
4 March 2010
Article 11 of the amended Treaty on European Union makes participatory democracy a tool to strengthen the democratic legitimacy of the European Union and therefore a principle of governance, as a complement to representative democracy. Thus civil dialogue becomes one of the major tools in policy-shaping and decision-making processes at European level. The EU institutions are required to conduct "an open, transparent and regular dialogue with representative associations and civil society" The text is available in English and French.
