    Français (French) The final draft of a ‘roadmap’ on how to improve and strengthen citizen involvement in EU decision-making has been agreed at an NGO Forum in Riga (Latvia) – in which AEDH took part – at the beginning of this month. By bringing together over 300 delegates from 34 European countries on 2nd and 3rd March, with representatives from NGOs and public sector, experts and politicians, the overarching goal of the NGO Forum was to create proposals on how to ensure closer links between citizens and decision-makers. During two days, the Forum discussed innovative approaches to promoting civil society involvement and improving democratic processes, human rights, environment and sustainability. Articles 11.1 and 11.2 of the Treaty of the European Union recognise the importance of maintaining open and regular dialogue between citizens and decision-makers. However, it is commonly assumed that these principles are not being upheld in current EU decision-making processes. This why the NGO Forum adopted the “Roadmap for the implementation of Articles 11(1) and 11(2) of the Treaty on European Union”. This roadmap has been prepared under the leadership of the EESC liaison group, a body created in 2004 by the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) to interact with European civil societies organisations and of which AEDH is a member. This roadmap provides experts proposals on how these articles could be better implemented and sets out a vision of what the dialogue should seek to achieve and how it could be implemented in an effective and constructive manner.
