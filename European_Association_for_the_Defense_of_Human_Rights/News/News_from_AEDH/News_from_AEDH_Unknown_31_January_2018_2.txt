    Français (French) Last November, AEDH participated in the consultation of EASO (European Asylum Support Office) on its training module “Interpreting in the context of asylum”. On this occasion, the AEDH had conducted an interview with Sophie Pointurier to understand the issues of public service interpretation (to be found in the AEDH Newsletter – December 2017). EASO just sent us the final document from this consultation! In the first quarter of 2018, the module will be available on the Agency’s e-learning platform and a “pilot” session will be organized in May.
