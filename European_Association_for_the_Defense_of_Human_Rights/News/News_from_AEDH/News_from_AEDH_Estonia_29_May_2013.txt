    Français (French) The European Association for the Defence of Human Rights (AEDH) and its member organisations will come together in Tallinn this weekend for AEDH’s General Assembly 2013. On the eve of the Assembly, the human rights organisations will debate on the theme of citizenship. The event is organised together with AEDH’s Estonian member, the Legal Information Centre for Human Rights (LICHR). About 20 human rights organisations from European Union countries will participate in AEDH’s annual seminar and General Assembly in Tallinn from 31st May to 2nd June. The event is opened on Friday with the public seminar “citizenship, citizenships”. AEDH member organisations, academic experts, members of the European Parliament and citizens will discuss and exchange views on crucial aspects of citizenship, including the problem of statelessness, residence-based citizenship as well as social citizenship. The seminar concludes with an exchange on best practises of AEDH member organisations. The 1st of June is dedicated to AEDH internal workshops. In view of the European elections 2014, AEDH and its member organisations will develop key recommendations in the field of human rights. European parties will be asked to integrate these recommendations in their political programmes for the 2014 elections later in the year. The gathering concludes with AEDH’s statutory General Assembly on Sunday, the 2nd June. Member organisations as well as individual members will evaluate past activities and discuss the future planning of the association. Download the programm of the seminar
