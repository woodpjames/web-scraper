    Français (French) 18 June 2018 – Last February, AEDH, represented by its coordinator, took part in the shooting of an online training module organised by No Hate Speech Movement to fight cyber-harassment and hate messages on the Internet.  The training is now online. You are young and want to become an actor of change on the web? Have you ever been confronted with hate messages on the Internet, cases of cyber-harassment? Do you want to respond constructively and invite other young people to do the same? Then join the #CyberCRACCS network! These training modules are intended for young people over 10 but can certainly also be useful for adults! Feel free to share information around you, including via this YouTube playlist! There will be 14 videos and 14 quizzes to complete. To learn more, visit the training page by clicking here
