    Français (French) Next May, European Parliament elections will take place. In this context, we, the member organisations of the European Association for the Defense of Human Rights (AEDH), express our major concern about the current drift of the European Union and its institutions and therefore wish to put Human Rights at the centre of these elections. If you want to learn more about the issues of the European Parliament elections, to know how to vote in your country or to read our manifesto "For a Europe of rights", visit our website!
