    Français (French) On 28 September, for the International Day for the Right to Abortion, the World March of Women together with many associations and organisations, including the European Association for the Defence of Human Rights (AEDH), mobilised across Europe, to demand that in every European country, all women who wish to abort can do so legally and in the best conditions. As a signatory to the appeal ‘Abortion, women decide! For the right to abortion throughout Europe’, AEDH took part in the demonstration organised in Brussels where hundreds of persons rallied to call on all EU Member States to grant women access to legal abortion in safe conditions. Following the demonstration, a petition was presented to the European Parliament urging national governments, MEPs and the Council of Europe guarantee the fundamental right to abortion.
