    Français (French) The AEDH is extremely concerned about the use of body scanners in Europe. After giving its opinion on the European Commission’s communication of 15 June 2010i, it would like to take this opportunity to express its position on the use of security scanners in general. Body, or "security", scanners have serious consequences for privacy and the protection of personal data. The need for such equipment, as well the implications of its use, must therefore be thoroughly evaluated.
