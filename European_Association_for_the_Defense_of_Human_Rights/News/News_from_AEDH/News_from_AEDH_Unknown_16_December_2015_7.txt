    Français (French) At the end of 2015, AEDH is glad to announce its recent adherence to the Frontexit campaign.  As an international campaign of several associations, Frontexit was launched in 2013 with the principle objective of abolishing the EU agency Frontex because of the incompatibility of its actions with the respect of the rights of migrants and refugees. More precisely, through actions of investigation, litigations, raising awareness and political advocacy, the campaign calls for:  The transparency of Frontex’s mandates, responsibilities and actions;  The suspension of the agency’s activities identified as contrary to human rights, especially maritime interception operations and group expulsions;  Enhanced control by the European Parliament of agreements signed between the agency and so-called ‘third’ countries;  AEDH’s participation as a new member of the campaign makes all the more sense as this year 2015 also marks the 10th anniversary of Frontex. In this context and on the occasion of the international day for human rights, the Frontexit team elaborated a set of documents on the 10 measures which put fundamental rights at risk: those that we will have to address in the next years.  What is found is beyond dispute: the reinforcement of Frontex’s role with regards to expulsions from hotspots, increased autonomy at the European borders, consequent increase in budget, possible access to police data with the clear aim to fight terrorism, increased cooperation with countries that do not respect human rights… All this in the most total opacity.  Acting to make Europe more respectful of human rights and democratic principles, AEDH denounces the incompatibility of Frontex’s security orientation with the values that Europe consistently promotes.  By joining the Frontexit campaign, AEDH wants to join in the already participating associations with its network and knowledge in order to work, all together, for different  European migration policies, transparent, united and respectful of the rights and liberties of all.  ***  To read the press release of the campaign on the occasion of the Human Rights Day:  http://euromedrights.org/publication/international-human-rights-day/  For more information on the campaign:  Europe is at war against an imaginary enemy: www.frontexit.org
