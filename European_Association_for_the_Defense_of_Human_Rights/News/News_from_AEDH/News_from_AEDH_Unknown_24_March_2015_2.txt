    Français (French) On the 18th of March 2015, the European Disability Forum – an NGO representing the interest of Europeans with disabilities since 1996 – has submitted its alternative report on the implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN CRPD) by the European Union to the UN Committee. First comprehensive human rights treaty to have been ratified by the EU as a whole in 2010, this Convention aims to ensure that people with disabilities can enjoy their rights on an equal basis with all other citizens. EDF alternative report has been prepared in the frame of the review process that will take place on 2 April 2015 by the UN Committee of the report that the EU has submitted on 5 June 2014 describing the work it has done to put in practice the principles of the UN CRPD since its ratification in 2010. EDF report is the result of a collective work with EDF’s members and civil society organisations, including AEDH, whose expertise allowed giving a clear view on the situation of persons with disabilities all over Europe regarding the enjoyment of their political, civil, economic, social and cultural rights. Therefore, EDF alternative report aims to inform the UN Committee about how the UN CRPD has been implemented by the European Union and its institutions by analysing gaps in the EU report submitted on 5 June 2014 and by complementing it where relevant with information received from its members and other civil society organisations. In April and August 2015, EDF will be in Geneva to defend its report and express to the UN Committee its main concerns on the implementation of the Convention by the EU.
