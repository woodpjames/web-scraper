    Français (French) Over the past year, AEDH has been examining the situation of Roma people in Europe. In October 2012, AEDH published the report “Roma people in Europe in the 21st century: violence, exclusion, insecurity” denouncing the physical violence towards Roma populations from the European states and the European citizens. The report Roma people in Europe in the 21st century: violence, exclusion, insecurity outlines the forms of violence suffered by Roma people in the countries across the European Union and in other European states (Croatia, Switzerland, Norway, Serbia, etc.). It is divided in three parts: violence against Roma people from the state; violence against Roma people from the citizens; social violence suffered by Roma people. The scope of this study is to show that Roma people are not only victims of social discrimination, but also of physical violence in all the European Union member states (without any exception), and that anti-Roma racism is deeply rooted in the European societies. AEDH calls on the European institutions and the national and local authorities of EU member states to fight first against this violence and this xenophobic resentment whilst encouraging a better respect of the social rights of Roma in order to ensure the success of “national Roma integration strategies”.
