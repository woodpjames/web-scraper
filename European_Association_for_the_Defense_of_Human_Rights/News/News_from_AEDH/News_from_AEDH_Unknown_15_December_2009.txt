15 December 2009 â€“ AEDH-EDRI European Civil Society Data Protection Award: Call for nominations opened
15 December 2009
   AEDH (European Association for the Defence of Human rights) and EDRI (European Digital Rights) launch the first edition of the European Civil Society Data Protection Award (ECSDPA). The prize aims at rewarding positive initiatives contributing to the visibility and effectiveness of right to privacy and to the protection of personal data in Europe. The ECSDPA prize will be awarded each year on 28 January, as a European Civil Society contribution to the Data Protection Day. Such achievements and initiatives have to enhance public awareness, stimulate creative and constructive input, and favour useful exchanges of information at any level, from the very local neighbourhood to the whole European continent. The award is open to all non-governmental organisations, trade unions, non-profit institutions and any other civil society actor from the 47 member States of the Council of Europe. The ECSDPA winner will benefit from a one week lobbying training in Brussels, travel expenses and lodging being fully covered. The ECSDPA initiative, the first of its kind, has been made possible thanks to the support of The Law Science Technology & Society Research Group of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (LSTS/VUB) and The Flemish-Dutch House deBuren. You can find the operational details about the prize, including application and selection procedures, by following the link: http://www.ecsdpa.org.
