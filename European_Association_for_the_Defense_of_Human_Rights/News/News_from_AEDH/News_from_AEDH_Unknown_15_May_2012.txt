    Fran√ßais (French) AEDH signed a common statement along with 64 other organisations call EU member States and the European Commission to safeguard family life of migrants and refugees. This common statement is following the public consultation on family reunification launched by the European Commission in early 2012, to which AEDH contributed. The NGOs ask that the member States respect the directive on family reunification and that the European Commission launches infringement proceedings against member States who do not respect the minimum standards guaranteed by the directive.
