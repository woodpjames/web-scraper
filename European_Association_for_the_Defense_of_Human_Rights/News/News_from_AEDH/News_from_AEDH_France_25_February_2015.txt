    Français (French) On 25 February 2015 – As part of the right of petition granted to European citizens, seven French and European associations, including AEDH, have decided to address a complaint to the European Parliament on expulsion and detention measures enacted by the French government toward European citizens, especially Romanian and Bulgarian, for the vast majority from the Roma community. France has for a long time conducts restrictive interpretation and application of the law of the European Union concerning the possibilities of expulsion of EU citizens. The French authorities enact expulsion measures abusively based on the concept of “threat to public order” and “insufficient resources” or on the concept of “abuse of rights” provided for in the Directive 2004/38/EC, without complying with the requirements of EU law. Moreover, while the detention of EU citizens should be made only in limited cases, the submitted petition demonstrates that the administrative detention in custody is widely used in France against citizens of the Union, and especially against Romanian and Bulgarian nationals. These are especially those designated as “Roma” that are the target of such measures. Such measures reveal discrimination based either on the nationality or ethnicity, which is clearly contrary to Article 18 TFEU and Article 21(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Yet, neither the EU law nor the French law provide sufficient guarantees to appeal against these decisions, while this is an attack on freedom of movement, considered by the European Court of Justice as fundamental freedom. Therefore, our seven associations – French and European – would like the Parliament to use the means at its disposal to ensure that France respects, both in law and in administrative practice, the exercise of the right, by EU citizens, to free movement.
