    Français (French) A joint statement on the seasonal workers proposal for a directive, made by AEDH together with other NGOS, was released on April 20th 2011, at the occasion of a LIBE hearing on “Legal migration after the Lisbon treaty”. The objectives of the directive, as laid out in the explanatory memorandum of the proposal, are to answer to a permanent need for low and unskilled labour in sectors employing seasonal workers, to create a common entry system for seasonal workers across the Schengen area, and to address the exploitation and sub-standard working conditions in the seasonal work sector for third-country nationals.
