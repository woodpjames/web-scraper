    Français (French) At the end of this year, we find it relevant to map out the most striking guidelines of European policies in response to the “migration crisis”. The review below sums up the main stages of the decision process which obviously did not prioritise the reception of refugees and the protection of their rights. In particular the last trimester of 2015 with the Valletta summit and the agreement with Turkey is evidence of the EU’s attempt to push the problem outside of the EU’s borders. If the refugees became invisible, the tensions between the Member States would decrease for sure…  The EU also has committed quite quickly to a certain number of relocation and resettlement places and to support of third countries, but these measures are far from being completely implemented.   è  The European answer to the « migration emergency » – Chronology of events: 2015   8 23 April – Special meeting of the European Council  Following the tragic events which happened in the Mediterranean in April 2015, the EU heads of state and government agreed on taking all the necessary steps to avoid any more loss of human life in the sea and to tackle the root causes of migration. They decided to focus on 4 main areas:      The leaders of the EU insisted on the paramount importance of the upcoming Commission’s communication of a European agenda on migration and asked for the organisation of a summit in Valletta in order to examine jointly with African and other relevant countries migration-related issues. Furthermore, they decided to strengthen the Triton and Poseidon operation by at least tripling their resources for 2015 and 2016.  ?

Concrete actions and measures are defined in the following 4 areas:      ? Voir la communication de la Commission sur un agenda européen en matière de migration en [FR], [EN]  ?
