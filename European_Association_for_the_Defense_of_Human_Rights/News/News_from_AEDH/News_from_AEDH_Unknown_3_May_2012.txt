    Français (French) European Association for the Defence of Human Rights’ Annual General Meeting Motion, 28th and 29th of April, 2012 AEDH condemns the forced eviction of 250 Roma families from their Belvil’s informal settlement in Belgrade (Serbia).This eviction has been organized by the Belgrade municipality on the 26th of April 2012: these evictions have been done without appropriate prior consultation and information of the concerned population proposing inadequate and indecent alternative housing solution. The Serbian authorities are violating international law by allowing the Belgrade city authorities to organize these evictions. AEDH appeals to the Serbian authorities to stop the forced evictions and to correct this situation by proposing decent solutions to the evicted families. AEDH is adopting this motion during its general assembly held in Brno, Czech Republic, on the 28th and 29th of April 2012 and following a seminar day on “Roma in Europe” held on 27th of April 2012 concluding that fundamental rights of Roma are seriously breached in Europe and that this must be immediately stopped. AEDH is calling all European and National authorities to stop violence against Romas and is once more observing intolerable attitudes held by national authorities like in Belgrade on the 26th of April 2012.  Brno, 29th of April 2012  AEDH is a European association bringing together 28 human rights NGOs from 21 European countries.
