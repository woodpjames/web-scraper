    Français (French) AEDH supports, with other European and national NGOs and associations, the Freedom not Fear action, which will take place in Brussels on September 17th, 18th and 19th ending a week of actions in Berlin. The protest is directed against the ongoing spread of excessive surveillance measures on the part of businesses, administrations and governments worldwide. With this international campaign we aim to raise public awareness of this issue and to form a broad and sustainable movement for freedom and democracy within and beyond Europe. We are going to raise our voice against data retention, against censorship on the internet and for the protection of our personal data and rights, not only on the internet. Due to the recent development, it became more and more clear that this issue has to be handled at the European level and that it therefore requires to take action from the civil society all over Europe in order to make our point clear. AEDH is signatory of an International call for action which critizes the ongoing spread of excessive surveillance measures. Click here to read it. Find out more about the events planed in Brussels.
