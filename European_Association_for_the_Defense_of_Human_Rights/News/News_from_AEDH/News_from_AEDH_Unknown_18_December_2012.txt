Our Italian friends were unfortunately not able to participate in the workshop. The Catalan Institute for Human Rights, the Association for the defense of Human Rights of Andalusia, the Portuguese League of Human Rights and the Greek League of Human Rights shared their experiences and difficulties and discussed about the regressions and violations that are taking place in the area of economic and social rights. The privatization of social services, the real estate crisis and the devastation caused by the high unemployment are part of the daily life of a growing number of inhabitants of Southern Europe.
