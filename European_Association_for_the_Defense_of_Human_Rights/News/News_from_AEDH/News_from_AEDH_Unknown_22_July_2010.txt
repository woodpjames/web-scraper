20 July 2010 – Europe, it’s TIME to ratify the Migrant Workers Convention
22 July 2010
The International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families was signed 20 years ago by the UN General Assembly. However, none of the EU Members States has ratified it yet. The AEDH, as one of the 42  sponsors of the petition for the ratification of  the Migrant Workers  Convention, calls on EU Member states to finally  ratify it. Sign the petition here.
