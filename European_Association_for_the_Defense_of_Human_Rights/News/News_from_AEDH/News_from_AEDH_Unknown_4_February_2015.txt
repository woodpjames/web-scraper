    Français (French) 26/27 January 2015 – The French Human Rights League (LDH) has initiated the European project “Act against the gender pay gap” gathering a broad partnership of national and European organisations, including AEDH. The project aims at acting for the equality in pay of women and men and focuses on the case of informal carers, persons helping voluntarily a relative or friend who has become dependent. Those carers are majorly women. As associated partner, AEDH will contribute in particular to informing and awareness raising of politicians and the wider public on the challenges and difficulties for informal carers in their professional life and in particular regarding their salaries. More on discriminations of informal carers: consult the results of a preceding project of the French Human Rights League (in French only).
