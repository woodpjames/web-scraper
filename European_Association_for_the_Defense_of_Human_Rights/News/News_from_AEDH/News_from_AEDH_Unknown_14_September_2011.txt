    Français (French) AEDH organized, on the occasion of its 2011 General Assembly together with ALOS-LDH its member league from Luxembourg, a seminar entitled "Practices of imprisonment in Europe and Human rights: is exclusion the only solution?". This seminar was followed by a round-table in which several European experts gave a speech on the issue. Facing what appears to be a form of a growing social life "criminalization", the aim of the seminar was to think about the meaning of punishment and confinement and their implications in regard to the need of respect of rights and human dignity that calls for a human progress vision. Download the anthology which includes the speeches from the seminar and the round-table, as well as newspapers articles published afterwards. (The anthology is only availble in French, translation in English underway).
