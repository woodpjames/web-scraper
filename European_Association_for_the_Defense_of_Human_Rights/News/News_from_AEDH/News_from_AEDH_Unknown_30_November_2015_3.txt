    Français (French) Brussels, 16 November 2015 On 13th November, Paris was the scene of gruesome slaughter. The appalling and provisional toll is of 129 people dead and more than 300 wounded. Murdering in the name of God can in no way be considered a mitigating circumstance to the crimes that have been committed. By taking away lives in the pursuit of its cause, Daesh and its henchmen are attacking the whole of humanity, in Syria just as in Iraq, in Beirut just as in Paris. The  European Association for the Defence of Human Rights (AEDH) calls on all concerned authorities to show due diligence in their task of finding the perpetrators and the sponsors behind these attacks. However, AEDH would like to stress that the value and the credibility of defending society derives entirely from the compliance to the rule of law. Any illegal procedure, any breach to justice, any generalization made on a given community, any stigmatisation as regards to someone’s suspected or actual origin, are incitements for the assassins, as they look for them avidly.  AEDH, confident in its European-wide commitment for the defence of all rights, observes that terrorism has never been fought successfully by undermining fundamental rights. This is the lesson to be learnt in order to avoid repeating the recent mistakes that, from the war in Afghanistan to disastrous interventions in Iraq, Libya and Syria, have fuelled instability in our world. AEDH expresses  solidarity to the families of the victims and to the mourning city of  Paris, but we also believe that our feelings of solidarity should be  addressed to all the country and its residents. Beyond, all countries  are potential targets. It is at the European scale that the defence of  rights, liberties, democracy and people’s security should become  effective.
