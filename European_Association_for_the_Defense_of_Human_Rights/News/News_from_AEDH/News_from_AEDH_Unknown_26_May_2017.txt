Download the full programme  ▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄ PROGRAMME ▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄  ► Conference | 1:30 pm 📣 The common project of European States is facing a crisis. The latter is illustrated by the Brexit, the building of blocks among states, the closing of borders and the multiplication of individual actions by member states….. Common initiatives are rare and when they exist, they are concentrating on downwards harmonisation of the existing rules protecting citizens. In this context, we need to explore options to rebuild the European Union on its founding values of human rights and democracy. The current state of the Union also raises questions on transnational civic engagement. The resurgence of nationalist, racist, xenophobic and security positions implies in part that voices defending a common future based on human rights have been unable to mobilise and convince on a sufficient level. This means that we also need to reflect on how civil society has to evolve. From 1.30pm on, come and join us to discuss together! Several speakers will lead the debate; names will be released very soon: stay tuned! ► Exhibition | from 1:30pm 📷 Discover the photo exhibition « Together or divided: Europe, a safe haven ? » organised by SHOWMEYOUROPE, a citizen and participative platform aiming at offering a space for young Europeans to express their views in multiple ways on the European Union. Young European photographers and amateurs share their personal point of view about refugees’ arrival and reception in Europe: come discover and discuss their work with them. ► Concert | from 6:30 pm 🎶 The day will end with plenty of music. The music band Nawaris will perform their new album “Migration” especially for us. >>> FREE EVENT <<<< [Thanks to the support provided by the savers of Triodos Bank, the King Baudouin Foundation, the French Community Commission (COCOF) and Wallonie-Bruxelles International (WBI).] We look forward to seeing you at Les Riches-Claires!
