    Français (French) The Commissioner Avramopoulos gave a speech full of optimism at the meeting of the LIBE Committee of the European Parliament on 14 January, as well as at the weekly meeting of the College of Commissioners. He seems to be convinced that in the year 2016, in contrast to 2015, the EU will “take action” and “turn towards the future”. è 2015: Weak outcomes  Passing review of the year 2015, it is true that it did not live up to the expectations which were alimented by the numerous projects launched by the Commission in order to cope with the so-called refugee “crisis” and the “influx of migrants”…  ◊ Relocations, hotspots, resettlement…  –          Of the 160 000 relocations decided by the Council last September, only 272 have been executed  –          Regarding the resettlement programm for 22 504 people by end of 2017, the Member States have so far created 779 places. This is less than 3.5% of the necessary and far below the commitments for 2015 (5 331).  –          Only 3 of the 11 hotspots aimed at alleviating the pressure on the EU’s external borders, are currently operational: one in Lesbos and two in Italy (Trapani and Lampedusa). … This situation of course does not support the implementation of the relocation scheme!  ◊  The Schengen zone is mishandled  In its state of play published on 16th January 2016, the Commission gives a cartographic overview on the different measures taken by the Member States in order to “protect” their territory.   Source : European Commission – Managing the refugee crisis – State of play and future actions, January 2016   AEDH has realised an overview on the measures taken by the Member states over the last trimester of 2015:                                                     ·         Measure of last resort  ·         Limited to a “period of no more than 30 days or for the foreseeable duration of the serious threat if its duration exceeds the period of 30 days”  ·         Existence of a “serious threat to public policy or internal security”  Another imperative condition: The Member State has to notify the Commission.  On 13 November 2015, the Commission has published the complete list of notifications which have been submitted since the beginning of the Schengen zone. There have been 50 reintroductions of border controls before 2015, but none has aimed at controlling the migration flow.  In its 8th half-year report, published on 15th December 2016, the Commission takes note that more and more Member States recur to border controls. The Commission observed that during the “refugee crisis” not only the migratory movements at the external borders have increased, but secondary movements inside the European Union as well. This combined with the fact that Member States of first entry do not register all the migrants seeking for international protection, has been seen as sufficient reason to introduce border controls in certain Member States.  Such an institutional “indulgence” can also be seen in the Commission’s evaluation on the necessity and proportionality of the controls at internal borders reintroduced by Germany and Austria. In this document, the Commission states that in its assessment, the reintroduction of the controls as well as its extension have been necessary and proportional. Nevertheless, a clear definition of what the Commission understands to be “necessary” or “proportional” is missing…  Regarding Slovenia, Hungary, Sweden and Norway, the Commission has taken note of the measures being taken, but has not published an assessment.   AEDH is worried about the increasing trend to reintroduce internal borders in order to “protect” member states of this imaginary “invasion”. Besides the fact that the free movement is a highly valued acquis of the EU among its citizens, the measures taken against the migrants have showed its derisory and counterproductive effects.  The reintroduction of border controls at internal borders can by no means help Member States to better control or even to prevent the secondary migratory flow within the EU. On the contrary, they tend to increase them and to emphasize the disorder. These measures increase the precariousness of the migratory trail and add more undignified treatments, but will not dissuade the migrants in search for a safe destination.  In this context, AEDH regrets that the European Commission did not judge necessary to be firmer in this regard; and it is to fear that, given the Commission’s reaction, the Member States will feel authorized to multiply their control measures.  In any case, it would be at least desirable to fix precise criteria in order to evaluate the necessity and the proportionality of the border controls. These controls, aiming at stemming the movement of asylum seekers, have so far put in danger one of the foundations of the European construction and failed completely in providing long term solutions for asylum seekers and refugees.   See:     è What is the Schengen zone?  In the continuity of the agreement between Germany, France and the three Benelux countries of 14th June 1985, the Schengen zone was officially created on 26th March 1995. At that time, nine Member States were part of Schengen: Germany, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Luxembourg, Netherlands and Sweden. In 2001, it has been enlarged by 4 countries (Island, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland) and in the following years by the new Member States.   ◊ The Member States of the Schengen zone  ? In 2016 the Schengen zone is composed of 22 Member States and 4 associated European countries  ? United Kingdom and Ireland opted out of the Schengen agreement  ? Although being a signatory State, Denmark can choose to apply or not any new measures taken under Title IV of the Treaty (visa, asylum, immigration and other policies related to the freedom of movement), even if such a measure is part of the development of the Schengen acquis. However, Denmark stays bound by certain measures under the common visa policy.  ? Other EU Member States are (still ?) not members of the Schengen zone: Bulgaria, Croatia and Rumania  ? Furthermore, the French and Dutch overseas territories are excluded of the zone.   ◊ Schengen acquis  The term Schengen acquis designates all legal texts containing operating rules of this “zone”.  ? Schengen agreement of the 14 June 1985 between France, Germany, Belgium, Netherlands and Luxembourg;  ? Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement signed on 19 June 1990 and entered into force on 26th March 1995;  ? Regulation Nr. 562/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 March 2006 establishing a Community Code on the rules governing the movement of persons across borders, called “Schengen Borders Code”; Entry into force: October 2006  In 1999, the Schengen Acquis has been incorporated into EU legislation via a Protocol annexed to the Amsterdam Treaty and becomes an integral part of Community law.   ◊ Framing the evolution of the reintroduction of temporary border controls  According to the regulation of 2006, the Member States of the Schengen zone can temporarily reintroduce border controls at its national borders in case of threat to public order or security for a renewable period of 30 days, in principle for a maximum period of six months (Article 23 et seq. of the “Schengen Borders Code”).  In 2013, after the controversy over the events of the Arab spring, France and Italy achieved that this deadline could be extended to 24 months in case of non-compliance by a Member State with its obligations to control external borders. At the request of the European Council (June 2011), the Commission proposed the revision of the “Borders Code”.  Adopted on the 20 December 2013, the amended regulation stipulates in article 26 the possibility to temporarily reintroduce controls for a period of six months, with the possibility to extend it three times. However, the decision to extend can only be taken with a recommendation of the Council (by qualified majority). In addition, the Council itself follows the assessment of the situation at the borders issued by the Commission, as well as the Commission’s conclusion on what is a “serious threat to public policy or internal security”.  Representatives of several Member States have recently asked for the triggering of these proceedings. No surprise, their request refers to the situation in Greece… To be followed in the agendas of the next sessions of the Council of the EU and the European Council.
