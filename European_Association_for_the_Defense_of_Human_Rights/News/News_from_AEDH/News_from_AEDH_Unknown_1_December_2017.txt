    Français (French) In a letter addressed to Ministers of Interior, representatives to the JHA Council as well as the Member of the European Parliament in charge of EURODAC, the European Association for the Defence of Human Rights (AEDH) and EuroMedRights urge policy makers to oppose the EURODAC proposal which lowers the age at which a child can be fingerprinted and have his/her facial images registered from the age of 14 to the age of 6. The European Parliament, Commission and Council will shortly discuss on whether coercion could be applied to obtain fingerprints or facial images of children as young as 6. AEDH and EuroMedRights demand the protection of childrens rights, both in the EURODAC proposals, and in upcoming negotiations on the Common European Asylum System reform.
